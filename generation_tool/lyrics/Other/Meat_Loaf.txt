Whatever happened to Saturday Night 
 When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright 
 It dont seem the same since cosmic light 
 Came into my life I thought I was divine 
 I used to drive around with a chick whod go 
 And listen to the music on the radio 
 A saxophone was blowing on a rock n roll show 
 You climbed in the back seat 
 Really had a good time 
 Hot patootie bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 My head used to swim from the perfume I smelt 
 My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt 
 Id taste her baby pink lipstick and thats when Id melt 
 Shed whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine 
 Get back in front put some hair oil on 
 Buddy Holly was singing his very last song 
 With your arms around you girl you try to sing along 
 You felt pretty good woo 
 I really love that rock and rollIm not afraid to show you who I am 
 And I am not ashamed of my life 
 Though Ive walked alone down this cold and soulless road 
 Ive always felt your heat in my bones 
 With every step I rise and fall 
 With everything to gain I end up losing it all 
 When the darkness gets in 
 I scream out and your light sets me free 
 Im not afraid of the past no more 
 Im not afraid and Im bad for good 
 I used to dance to the devils beat 
 If I could bust into hell I would 
 Im not afraid to shed all my skin 
 Im not afraid of the faults you see 
 Im tearing down these walls right now 
 Theyre comin down cause I believe 
 Your love is blind blind as a bat 
 The way that youre leading me home like that 
 Im not afraid when they kick me down 
 Im not afraid when I start to bleed 
 Im not afraid if I live or die 
 Im not afraid cause I believe 
 And I wish that I could give you something in return 
 For the precious time you wasted on the tears Ive never earned 
 For reaching out to help me cross the bridges that I burned 
 And in the end youll finally see 
 That baby Ive done everything I possibly can 
 I do it again cause know youre everything that I need 
 Im not afraid of the the truth no more 
 Im not afraid of the lies I hid 
 Im not afraid of the price of my sins 
 I curse the day for the wrongs I did 
 Im not afraid of the things you know 
 Im just a book for the world to read 
 My final words on the final page 
 Will be your name cause I believe 
 Your heart is kind mines painted black 
 The way you forgive me and just take me back 
 Your love is blind blind as a batThey say you never come home 
 Boy you been driving too fast 
 When you gonna shape up 
 How long is this gonna last 
 You may be laughin today 
 But listen to some good advice 
 Take a look at tomorrow in a workin mans weary eyes 
 You gotta pick a career 
 Go for the gold 
 Smile for the camera 
 Do what youre told 
 Well you can take away the ladder cause I aint gonna climb it 
 If theres a stairway to heaven I swear Im gonna find it 
 Yeah there are winners and outlaws 
 And leaders and lovers 
 Behind every man in the news 
 And one thing I know is behind everyone 
 Theres a boy who had nothing to lose 
 Behind every man who has somethin to say 
 Theres a boy who had nothing to prove 
 Every hero was once 
 Every villain was once 
 Just a boy with a bad attitude 
 She says you never call 
 How come youre actin so tough 
 You either hold me so tight 
 Or you dont hold me enough 
 Dont be afraid a me angel 
 I aint about to clip your wings 
 Just put your feet on the ground 
 And your arms around the real thing 
 You gotta love me for keeps 
 Feather the neat 
 Plan for the future 
 Gimmee your best 
 But were never gonna have a normal family life 
 Steamin up and down the speedway on the back a your bike 
 Bad attitude 
 You got us tearin our hair 
 Such a bad attitude 
 Boy you just dont seem to care 
 We try to lay down the rules 
 But you were born to refuse 
 Whats the world gonna do with a boy like you 
 You got it bad 
 You got a bad attitudeI still dream of you wakin up openin your eyes 
 Like a little girl I once knew walkin to the window 
 Lookin down on the street 
 You walk with me and I walk with you 
 Well I thought it all over it doesnt make any sense 
 Why did it fall apart when it seemed so innocent 
 You and I were like a light from a fallen star 
 You cant go back you cant run away from your heart 
 Dont you look at me like that 
 Cause I fall all over again 
 And I just cant hold on to your love anymore 
 Cause I start all over again 
 And it just cant be like it was once before 
 Dont stand there in the rain 
 Lookin like some long lost angel 
 Lookin like some long lost angel 
 And it just cant be like it was once beforeI was temporarily blind by a neon dollar sign 
 It pacified my mind and whispered things are fine 
 Said Boy if you wanna heal just sign this paper deal 
 Youll never have to beg no youll never have to steal 
 But when that giving tree stops giving 
 Ive gotta get back to living living like I did before 
 With a mattress on the floor and no food in my kitchen 
 I gotta get back to living like I did before 
 Living like I did before 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get whatever you can get 
 Down in the city streets grows a giving tree 
 Out of solid stone mortared by my bone 
 And watered by my tears strengthened by my fears 
 Its gonna grow strong its gonna live longgonna haunt me for years 
 Its beautiful fruit seems ripe at ground level 
 Its dangerous roots lead straight down to the devil 
 Lead straight down to the devil 
 When that giving tree stops giving 
 One pound of gold ten pounds of flesh 
 Sell this old soul ever you can get 
 Like I did before 
 Gonna sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Like I did beforeYeah 
 Yeah keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel 
 Keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel 
 Yeah were goin to the Roadhouse 
 Were gonna have a real 
 Good time 
 Yeah back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows 
 And thats for the people 
 Who like to go down slow 
 Let it roll baby roll 
 Let it roll all night long 
 Do it honey do it 
 You gotta roll roll roll 
 You gotta thrill my soul all right 
 Roll roll roll roll 
 Thrill my soul 
 You gotta beep a gunk a chucha 
 Honk konk konk 
 You gotta each you puna 
 Each ya bop a luba 
 Each yall bump a kechonk 
 Ease sum konk 
 Ya ride 
 Ashen lady Ashen lady 
 Give up your vows give up your vows 
 Save our city save our city 
 Right now 
 Well I woke up this morning I got myself a beer 
 Well I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer 
 The futures uncertain and the end is always near 
 Let it roll all night longThe skies were pure and the fields were green 
 And the sun was brighter than its ever been 
 When I grew up with my best friend Kenny 
 We were close as any brothers that you ever knew 
 It was always summer and the future called 
 We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all 
 There was so much left to dream 
 And so much time to make it real 
 But I can still recall the sting of all 
 The tears when he was gone 
 They said he crashed and burned 
 I know Ill never learn 
 Why any boy should die so young 
 We were racing we were soldiers of fortune 
 We got in trouble but we sure got around 
 There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark 
 I think hes right behind me now and hes gaining ground 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 They are 
 And when the sun descended and the night arose 
 I heard my father cursing everyone he knows 
 He was dangerous and drunk and defeated 
 And corroded by failure and envy and hate 
 There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze 
 Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees 
 And my fathers eyes were blank 
 As he hit me again and again and again 
 I know I still believe hed never let me leave 
 I had to run away alone 
 So many threats and fears so many wasted years 
 Before my life became my own 
 And though the nightmares should be over 
 Some of the terrors are still intact 
 Ill hear that ugly coarse and violent voice 
 And then he grabs me from behind 
 And then he pulls me back 
 There was a beauty living on the edge of town 
 She always put the top up and the hammer down 
 And she taught me everything Ill ever know 
 About the mystery and the muscle of love 
 The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow 
 Im in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo 
 And the signs along the highway all said 
 Caution Kids At Play 
 Those were the rights of spring and we did everything 
 There was salvation every night 
 We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn 
 But everything we tried was right 
 She used her body just like a bandage 
 She used my body just like a wound 
 Ill probably never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now 
 Just like an angel rising up from a tomb 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 Ill never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat nowTwo AM with the lost and the lonely 
 Walkin past the kids comin back from the party 
 Smiles on their faces you remember so well how it was 
 Nights in the back of that buick that you got runnin 
 Your baby by your side told the whole world youre comin 
 Work so hard to do what is right 
 Believed in what youre doin 
 But so many fights 
 Trusted too many relieved to much 
 Workin your life to the bone 
 Theres a wolf at your door 
 He wants your money wants your soul 
 A wolf at your door 
 You give it all he wants more 
 He says hes playin for keeps 
 Breathin down your neck 
 Boy its sure hard to sleep 
 With a wolf at your door 
 Theyll take it away when youre not lookin 
 Look you in the eyes tell you how good theyre doin 
 Smiles on their faces are lies to keep you from knowin 
 Youre not guilty you are the victim 
 But you still pay for the crime 
 Dont look for truoble 
 Itll always find you in time 
 I wont be broken Ill fight til I drop 
 Blood runnin hot in my veins 
 But they wont be satisfied 
 Until they take everythingHow do you bury the skull of your country 
 How do you bury a nation of fears 
 Where you gonna hide your love through long years of dying 
 Give me a tombstone and a wreath of all your tears 
 Girl 
 Turn around 
 Boy 
 Theres a black day dawning 
 Theres a corpse in mouring 
 For your tin can graveyard 
 For your tin foil savior 
 Turn around bright eyes 
 Turn around bright eyes  
 There are drones on fire screaming 
 There are bloodshot rivers steaming 
 Let the final dance begin now 
 Were outlaw sons now 
 For the blood on the highways 
 For the new war each day 
 For the skies are hungry 
 For the end is thirsty 
 Turn around bright eyesIf This Is The Last Kiss Lets Make It Last All Night 
 I know youre goin I know this is goodbye 
 And I cant make you stay no matter how I try 
 But ooh if youre leaving please grant this one request 
 And leave my heart with some happiness 
 If this is the last kiss lets make it last all night 
 If this is the last time Im ever ever gonna hold you 
 Let me hold you tight till the morning light 
 If this is the last time ooh well ever be together 
 Kiss me and baby give me something 
 Tender to remember you by 
 If I cant be with you oh baby all my life 
 The next best thing is you next to me all through the night 
 Pull all the shades down put your heart next to mine 
 Tonight give me a chance to feel heaven just one more time 
 And ooh if youre leaving honey Ill set you free 
 Just leave my arms this one sweet memory 
 Baby give me something 
 Tender to remember you byIf I had money 
 Tell you what Id do

 Buy a Mercury or two

 Oh Im crazy bout a Mercury

 Well I had me a girl

 Oh she know I have a Mercury 
 Cruise it up and down 
 Im going out

 And Im gonna buy me some 
 MERCURY YeahIf it takes them so long so long to say yes 
 Why dont they just say no 
 We dont need anyone to be put to the test 
 Why dont they let us be 
 Livin for the right to be livin for the right 
 Livin for the right to be free 
 We needed a plan we needed defenses 
 They couldnt raise a smile 
 As the world looked down they raided our senses 
 There can be no reconcile 
 Burnin down burnin down burnin down burnin down 
 There was a time in our life was taken for granted 
 Itll never come again 
 Our flower is dead the seed is unplanted 
 They put it all to the flame 
 Burnin down burnin down 
 Burnin down burnin down burnin down burnin down to fadeLook at them now 
 What do they want 
 And what do they do now 
 Nothing at all 
 What do they know 
 What do they think 
 And who do they tell 
 Well no one at all 
 Lives are truly meaningless 
 And we are busy being blessed 
 With that we can take and pocket 
 No one needs to know 
 Were is the plug and theyre the socket 
 Give us the juice and well go 
 Cant you hear the choir now 
 Listen to the animals sing 
 Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king 
 How do they sleep 
 Their lives are so tart 
 Bring me the trash collectors 
 Cause theyre nothing but trash 
 What do you expect 
 Theyve got no standards 
 So we lower the bar 
 Cause theyre waiting for us 
 Well open up Pandoras Box 
 Pandora gave her keys and locks 
 Theyre the big dogs waiting for their mother 
 Come to the confessional 
 So I can tell you all to bugger off 
 Theres no time like now 
 Listen to the marketplace sing 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king 
 And well do it our way 
 Its our time to play 
 We know what to say 
 They stand in our way 
 Dont stand in our way 
 No time like today 
 Listen to the anthems we sing 
 Listen to the chosen ones sing 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is kingYou dont need to sneak in the door just come on in to the room 
 Ive been lying in our bed in the dark all alone 
 Ive been waiting Ive been waiting for you 
 Theres been no reason to move its been as still as a tomb 
 I needed you oh so badly tonight but I guess you had better things to do 
 I should have know that it was coming to this 
 But I must have been blind 
 I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes 
 And you still got his eyes on your mind 
 You swore youd be with me at 7 oclock 
 Now its a quarter to 3 
 Well whatever you got and whoever it was 
 I guess you couldnt get it from me 
 Whatever you got and whoever it was 
 I know that you love me theres no need to talk 
 I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof 
 And there are no lies on your body so take off your dress 
 I just want to get at the truth 
 And there are so many things that I just got to know 
 You tell me who You tell me where You tell me when 
 But dont tell me now I dont need any answers tonight 
 I just need some love so turn out the lights 
 And Ill be left in the dark again 
 Left in the dark again 
 Left Iin the dark again 
 You swore youd be with me at seven oclock 
 Now its a quarter to three 
 But down in my soul  down in my soul I know 
 Left in the dark againYou like ridin around with your big brother 
 In your uncles custom van 
 You wanna bleach your hair so bad 
 But your Mama dont understand 
 Hangin around by the monument 
 Dancin to the radio 
 You got a memory even shorter than your dress 
 But theres nothing you dont know 
 Priscilla 
 Nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid 
 Theyre gonna kill you for what you did 
 Cuttin class with a backstage pass 
 And always skippin lunch 
 Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys 
 And Daddys vodka in the punch 
 Learned how to jump start your Grandmas car 
 How to French inhale your Kools 
 And now you know that breakin hearts 
 Is easy as breakin the rules 
 Ya dont remember no revolution 
 You dont belong to no baby boom 
 Just you and your headphones 
 Dreamin in your pink bedroom 
 Strong girls break the records 
 And rich girls break their nails 
 Smart girls always know by heart 
 What some girls always fail 
 Bad little girls grow up to be good 
 And good girls finish last 
 But crazy girls dont care how they grow up 
 As long as they grow up fastGood girls go to heaven 
 But the bad girls go everywhere 
 When the wind is howling through your window pane 
 Its not the only pain of the night 
 Youre burning up in your bed you got a fever of love 
 And theres not an antibody in sight 
 Hey Jenny Jenny why are you crying 
 Theres a beauty of a moon in the sky 
 But I guess when youve been leading such a sheltered life 
 You never lift your head and look so high 
 You dont have a lot but its all that youve got 
 And you can turn it into more than it seems 
 Just give it a shot 
 Fantasize every movement 
 And imagine every inch of your dream 
 No one said it had to be real 
 But its gotta be something you can reach out and feel now 
 It aint right it aint fair 
 Castles fall in the sand and we fade in the air 
 And the good girls go to heaven 
 Good girls go to heaven 
 Somebody told me so 
 Somebody told me now I know 
 Every night in my prayer 
 Ill be praying that the 
 When the sweat is sizzling on your skin in the dark 
 And youre desperate now for somewhere to turn 
 Every muscle in rebellion every nerve is on edge 
 And every limb has been erotically burned 
 Hey Johnny Johnny why are you shaking 
 When a boy should do whatever he can 
 Youve been nothing but an angel every day of your life 
 And now you wonder what its like to be damned 
 But its gotta be something youve been wanting to feel now 
 And the good boys go to heaven 
 But the bad boys go everywhere 
 Good boys go to heaven 
 Every time I try and dream you 
 I cant believe how hard its been to 
 Conjure up your face 
 And trace your body in the air 
 All the seconds go on forever 
 But the thirds and fourth ones are even better 
 Everytime I do it just a little bit longer 
 Everytime I dream 
 Its just a little bit stronger than real life 
 Bad girls go everywhereAnother night sleepless 
 I dont want to feel this 
 Nothing can stop this pain 
 Trying to get to 
 A time I forget you 
 Still tangled in yesterday 
 Its so easy for you 
 To feel nothing for me 
 Did you ever feel anything 
 I want you to cry over me 
 Die over me 
 Even for a moment 
 I want you to hurt over me 
 Feel what I feel 
 I want you to cry over die over me 
 Baby just one time 
 I want your heart broken 
 Some sign of emotion 
 I want to see the tears tumble down 
 Show me I meant something 
 And that you feel nothing 
 But your world crashing to the ground 
 To forget about me 
 Did I ever mean anything 
 Cry  cry  cry 
 But did you feel something 
 Did we mean nothing at all 
 I want you to cry over cry over me 
 Oh why cant you just cry over die over me 
 Baby why cant you hurt like I do like I hurt over you 
 Cant you cry over die over me 
 Baby want you to fall on your knees 
 Baby crawl back to me 
 Want you to cry over die over me 
 Cry  cry  crySomeone told me long ago 
 Theres a calm before the storm I know 
 And its been coming for some time 
 When its over so they say 
 Itll rain a sunny day I know 
 Shining down like water 
 I wanna know have you ever seen the rain 
 I wanna know have you ever seen the rain 
 Coming down on a sunny day 
 Ahhhhh 
 Oh yeah 
 Yesterday and days before 
 Sun is cold and rain is hard I know 
 Been that way for all my time 
 Til forever on it goes 
 Through the circle fast and slow I know 
 And it cant stop I wonder 
 Yeah 
 Yeah I wanna know have you ever seen the rain 
 Have you ever seen the rain 
 Boy 
 There aint no hidden treasure 
 In this pot of gold you see 
 Aint no way youre going to make 
 No silky purse outta me 
 Well Im never ever gonna change your ways 
 Ill take you as you are 
 But you got something that I want 
 And thats one way to go 
 Both 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you aint seen nothing yet 
 Yeah I told you that I loved ya 
 Right from the very start 
 Now dont you make me sorry girl 
 Thatll open up my heart 
 Well I know that Im no angel 
 Can say my first time out 
 But you can count on what Ive got 
 Cause what Ive gots a lotdont you know 
 baby baby baby 
 how ya doin now 
 When its cold I want it hot 
 Ive always wanted what its not 
 But when it comes to loving you 
 Im yours no matter what you do 
 Oh youre my baby and Im your man 
 This is not an angels plan 
 Youre not too skinnynot too fat 
 Loving you is where its at 
 And you aint seen nothing yet 
 repeat and fadeI I fall for everything 
 Under the sun over the moon 
 Coming undone broken in two 
 You you fall for anything 
 Living the lie like all the rest 
 Walking the line out on the edge 
 Every saint is a sinner someday 
 No one is safe 
 You can fall from grace in so many ways 
 One step forward two back 
 You cant run away from that empty space 
 You will find your place 
 When you lose your way 
 We all will fall from grace 
 I feel like I never land 
 Out of the grey into the black 
 Wasting away starting to crack 
 Life life is just history 
 Learning to die reaching for stars 
 Coming to life wearing the scars 
 And its a sweet salvation 
 When you know youve reached the bottom 
 And you can finally pick yourself back up 
 Fall from grace in so many ways 
 We all will fall 
 We all will fall from grace45 second of ecstasy 
 How it comes right back to me 
 Fly so high and feel so free 
 45 seconds of ecstasy 
 Cuts right through the complexity 
 When I feel him right next to me 
 45 seconds of ecstasyWasted youth Wasted youth 
 I know that I will never be politically correct 
 And I dont give a damn about my lack of etiquette 
 As far as Im concerned the world could still be flat 
 And if the thrill is gone then its time to take it back 
 If the thrill is gone then its time to take it back 
 Who am I Why am I here Forget the questions someone gimme another beer 
 Whats the meaning of life whats the meaning of it all 
 You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl 
 So sign up all you raw recruits throw away those designer suits 
 You got your weapons cocked your targets in your sights 
 Theres a party raging somewhere in the world 
 You gotta serve your country gotta service your girl 
 Youre all enlisted in the armies of the night 
 And I aint in it for the power and I aint in it for the health 
 I aint in it for the glory of anything at all 
 And I sure aint in it for the wealth 
 But Im in it till its over and I just cant stop 
 If you wanna get it done you gotta do it yourself 
 And I like my music like I like my life 
 Everything louder than everything else everything louder than everything else 
 Wasted youth Wasted youth Wasted youth Wasted youth 
 They got a file on me and its a mile long 
 And they say that they got all of the proof 
 That Im just another case of arrested development 
 And just another wasted youth 
 They say that Im in need of some radical discipline 
 They say I gotta face the truth 
 They say Im wild and Im reckless I should be acting my age 
 Im an impressionable child in a tumultuous world 
 And they say Im at a difficult stage 
 But it seems to me to the contrary 
 Of all the crap theyre going to put on the page 
 That a wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 If you want my views of history then theres something you should know 
 The three men I admire most are Curly Larry and Moe 
 If you dont worry bout the future sooner or later its the past 
 And if they say the thrill is gone then its time to take it back 
 So sign up all you raw recruits throw away all those twobit suits 
 Youre all inducted in the armies of the night 
 If you wanna get it done you gotta fight for yourself 
 Everything louder than everything else repeats outFrom the minute I turned and laid eyes on you 
 I had no eyes of my own I was blind to the world 
 You were to good to be true but you were something to see 
 So very young and alone and still I dont believe 
 The way you turned on me now wheres the girl that I knew 
 I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love 
 You gave me nothing but trouble man I was such a fool 
 You gave me nothing at all now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me  let me count the ways 
 How many hours in how many days 
 How does it amuse you  let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking how many games 
 You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack 
 Go on and take all your stuff  dont even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life  
 But Ill kill you if you dont come back 
 Ill kill you if you dont come back 
 In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close 
 And then youd hold me so tight and in the wink of an eye 
 You used to give me it all and with a kiss in the darkness 
 Youd deliver the light 
 And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud 
 I know youre laughing at me oh aint it funny and sad 
 The way I fell for your lies the way I fell into love 
 And then begged to be free 
 You gave me nothing at all  now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel  now let me try it on you 
 Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach 
 Theyre dreamin of boys and just out of reach 
 Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track 
 Theyre glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs 
 Bless all the girls in gangs on the street 
 Theyre looking for danger and theyre holding their piece 
 Bless all the girls staying late after school 
 Theyre playing with fire and theyre playing it cool 
 And bless all the shy girls whore learning to dance 
 They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance 
 Bless all the girls who are always alone 
 They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone 
 Bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 Theyre looking for magic in gymnasium lights 
 And bless all the girls who know what love is about 
 They try not to cry and then they try to put out 
 And bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met 
 But damn you and curse you after all that youve done 
 Youre the one girl Ill never forget 
 Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do 
 But damn me and curse me for still needing you 
 And Ill kill you if you dont come back 
 Ill kill you if you dont come backThere have been many sightings 
 Of love in truth 
 The skeptic in me longs for 
 To see of love some proof 
 Only for you does this happen 
 Only for you do I care 
 Love is not real 
 Love is a hoax 
 Its just a dream 
 Ive had so many nights alone 
 Love is not here 
 Love is somewhere else 
 Its somewhere far 
 No man Ive ever knowns 
 Come close 
 It can be vicious heartless 
 Dire and cruel 
 In spite of my mind my heart longs 
 To find fire and fuel 
 Only for you do I do this 
 Is somewhere far 
 My girlfriend doesnt want 
 To know me 
 And my friends think 
 Ive lost the plot 
 I have become a liability 
 I got to do something 
 But I dont know what 
 Im hearing voices and 
 I cant see straight 
 I think I might be going insane 
 Cant make my own decisions 
 And I just cant wait 
 To mess it all up again 
 I never thought that 
 I would succeed 
 Beyond the wildest dreams 
 Ive ever dreamt 
 But everythings become so 
 Hackneyed 
 Familiarity only breeds contempt 
 Im ruining your life 
 Im bored with mine 
 Im acting like I couldnt care less 
 Another bottle and another line 
 Another strange to undress 
 Next time you stab me in the back 
 Youd better do it to my face 
 When you forget 
 What you cannot forgive 
 The terms are so much easier to 
 Come to with 
 When we look at what 
 Were going through 
 And desaturate 
 Until everything is simple 
 Love or hate 
 Lover or hate 
 I have been searching my soul 
 Ive seen the brightest star 
 Ive seen the blackest hole 
 Ive found a way to cope with every 
 Twist of fate 
 Now everything is simple 
 And when that love comes crawling 
 Back to me to say 
 Ive been away 
 Now please let me stay with the 
 No way 
 Never again will I do this 
 Never again will I care 
 Ive had so many nights alone 
 Come closeI want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 But can you trust me

 Youre wastin your time 
 The boys bad news 
 Leave him alone 
 Cause its just bad news 
 Bad news 
 The boys bad newsWell I remember every little thing 
 As if it happened only yesterday 
 Parking by the lake 
 And there was not another car in sight 
 And I never had a girl 
 Looking any better than you did 
 And all the kids at school 
 They were wishing they were me that night 
 And now our bodies are oh so close and tight 
 It never felt so good it never felt so right 
 And were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Come on Hold on tight 
 Well come on Hold on tight 
 Though its cold and lonely in the deep dark night 
 I can see paradise by the dashboard light 
 Aint no doubt about it we were doubly blessed 
 Cause we were barely seventeen 
 And we were barely dressed 
 Aint no doubt about it 
 Baby got to go out and shout it 
 We were doubly blessed 
 Baby doncha hear my heart 
 You got it drowning out the radio 
 Ive been awaiting so long 
 For you to come along and have some fun 
 And I gotta let you know 
 No youre never gonna regret it 
 So open up your eyes I got a big surprise 
 Itll feel all right 
 Well I wanna make your motor run 
 Paradise by the dashboard light 
 You got to do what you can 
 And let Mother Nature do the rest 
 And we were barely 
 Were gonna go all the way tonight 
 Were gonna go all the way and tonights the night 
 Okay here we go we got a real pressure cooker going here Two down nobody on no score bottom of the ninth Theres the windup and there it is a line shot up the middle Look at him go this boy can really fly Hes rounding first and really turning it on now Hes not letting up at all hes gonna try for second The ball is bobbled out in the center and here comes the throw and what a throw Hes gonna slide in headfirst here he comes hes out No wait safe Safe at second base This kid really makes things happen out there Batter steps up to the plate Heres the pitch and hes going and what a jump hes got hes trying for third Heres the throw Its in the dirt safe at third Holy cow stolen base Hes taking a pretty big lead out there almost daring them to try and pick him off The pitcher glances over windsup and its bunted Bunted down the third base line and the suicide squeeze is on Here he comes squeeze play its gonna be close Heres the throw heres the play at the plate Holy cow I think hes gonna make it 
 Stop right there 
 I gotta know right now 
 Before we go any further 
 Do you love me 
 Will you love me forever 
 Do you need me 
 Will you never leave me 
 Will you make me so happy 
 For the rest of my life 
 Will you take me away 
 And will you make me your wife 
 Let me sleep on it 
 Baby baby let me sleep on it 
 Ill give you an answer in the morning 
 I gotta know right now 
 Whats it gonna be boy 
 Come on 
 I can wait all night 
 Whats it gonna be boy yes or no 
 Ah ah ah ahahah 
 Baby baby let me sleep on it 
 Oh let me sleep on it 
 The morning Ill tell you in the morning 
 Let me sleep on it 
 I couldnt take it any longer 
 Lord I was crazed 
 And when the feeling came upon me 
 Like a tidal wave 
 I started swearing to my God 
 And on my mothers grave 
 That I would love you till the end of time 
 I swore I would love you till the end of time 
 So now Im praying for the end of time 
 To hurry up and arrive 
 Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you 
 I dont think that I can really survive 
 Ill never break my promise or forget my vow 
 But God only knows what I can do right now 
 Im praying for the end of time 
 Thats all that I can do ooh ooh 
 Praying for the end of time 
 So I can end my time with you 
 And it was long ago and it was far away 
 And it was so much better than it is today 
 It was long ago and it was far away 
 And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knifeThe locusts are singing the sun is red 
 Its gotten so late somehow 
 Theres gonna be trouble you know what they said 
 We should have been home by now 
 The thunder is rolling the sky is black 
 Its gotten so dark somehow 
 Theres gonna be danger God I wish we were back 
 No matter what they tell us no matter what they do 
 No matter what they teach us what we believe is true 
 No matter what they call us however they attack 
 No matter where they take us well find our own way back 
 I cant deny what I believe I cant be what Im not 
 I know Ill love forever I know  
 No matter what if only tears were laughter 
 If only night was day if only prayers were answered 
 Then we would hear God say 
 No matter what they tell you no matter what they do 
 No matter what they teach you what you believe is true 
 And I will keep you safe and strong and sheltered from the 
 Storm 
 No matter where its barren A dream is being born 
 No matter who they follow No matter where they lead 
 No matter how they judge us Ill be everyone you need 
 No matter if the sun dont shine or if the skies are blue 
 No matter what the ending my life began with you 
 I know this loves forever I know 
 No matter what 
 I know this loves forever thats all that matters now 
 Theres gonna be danger God I wish I were back 
 We should have been home by nowCome a little closer its a feeling that I cant deny 
 I was weak but I never thought Id speak about the darker side 
 Is that a tent I could repent upon the side of the road 
 But I kept on going yeah I headed for another load 
 I get up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the night 
 Oh I testify 
 I was laid upon the grave by a preachers hand I cannot lie 
 And I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight 
 Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before 
 And could you lend me your hand because Im falling back on the floor 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the morning 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 On a road outside of nowhere in the middle of the night 
 Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight 
 And a Tempest made of fire onset the sky aglow 
 And a sweet young thing called out my name 
 And this is how it goes she says  
 Go boy can you hear them Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes 
 And I got down on my knees 
 I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning 
 Up from the ground and Im falling back down 
 Up from the ground and I testify 
 Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide 
 All the pain that you restrain keeps buildings up deep inside 
 If you think youre above it then its you my friend that I implore 
 Youve got to walk before you run 
 See the night before dawn 
 Before you pull yourself off the floor 
 Oh I testifyNever callin unanswered letters 
 How you been feelin better 
 Never lookin but youre hearin 
 Never speakin but youre feeling 
 All the silence and its wounding 
 Youre not healing just conceding 
 Play the game play the game 
 Oh brother to brother 
 All the blood runs red 
 Dont roll over dont play dead 
 Were all livin on the razors edge 
 All the blood runs ruby red 
 Were all victims of the razors edge 
 All the rules dont mean a thing 
 Theyre wasting time the memries sting 
 Keep your image plant that smile 
 Answer questions dont let on 
 Make up stories all put on thats your life 
 Your life is gone 
 Play the game 
 You see youre losing yet you still try 
 The game just a watches your life go by 
 Youre playin 
 WHY 
 Oh play the game 
 Youre playin well 
 Oh youre playing the game 
 Were all victims of the razors edgeBaby I think its over 
 The end is finally near 
 Dont wanna talk about it anymore 
 I see it all so clear 
 So pack your bags 
 And move on out 
 There aint nothing for you here 
 I think you know its over too 
 So why not disappear 
 Wait a minute baby 
 Whats that you say 
 You really dont think its fair 
 To send you outside 
 Into the cold cold night 
 Oh you poor poor girl 
 Well I dont really care 
 Cause youve been cold to me so long 
 Im cryin icicles instead of tears 
 So pack your bags and move on out 
 There aint nothin for you here  
 Baby I know its over 
 I got a last idea 
 Dont want to leave you emptyhanded 
 Well I agree that wouldnt be fair 
 Take along a little something to remember me by 
 A little something to show that I cared 
 Step right up you poor little girl 
 Take your souvenirs 
 You take your souvenirs 
 Step right up you poor poor girl 
 Take my heart 
 Drain it dry 
 I dont blame you now 
 Cause I know you really tried 
 Take my soul 
 You can have my mind 
 But youre never gonna get your hands on my love 
 Cause its mine mine  all mine 
 Take my master 
 You can have my slave 
 When Im dead or buried alive 
 You can always take my grave 
 Take my body 
 Well I know you really think its fine 
 Because its mine mine  all mine 
 Tell me right now 
 Whos playing this game 
 And which side do I choose 
 Im going down down 
 And Im spinning around 
 Is there anyone I can accuse 
 What are the odds 
 Or do I win or lose 
 Oh baby 
 Please sir by the way sir 
 May I be excused 
 Take my sorrow 
 Im running out of joy 
 When youre tired of playing with yourself 
 You can always take my toys 
 Take my baby 
 Show her a real good time 
 You always were a super dad 
 But as a lover you were less than fine 
 Take my jewels 
 Well I know you love to see them shine 
 I dont wanna play with you no more 
 I dont wanna play with you no more 
 I dont wanna play with you no more 
 Step right up you poor poor girlUnder your protective wing I walked into the light 
 And a thousand angry demons up and took flight 
 I went running through the fields with that fever in my veins 
 And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name 
 Above my head all in red I could see you 
 Leaning down on me you said youre not running out 
 You said youre leaving now 
 I will find you 
 There is no way out 
 Ill keep tracking you down in the still of the night 
 Mine forever mine forever 
 Dont leave your mark on me 
 No need to reply 
 Im not staying 
 Im just killing time 
 Theres no need to reply 
 This nightmare never ends 
 Memories of absent friends 
 Masked illusions stare at me 
 Point the finger silently 
 Stand accused of a dark affair 
 Theres a ghost in here somewhere 
 Mistress of the darkness accomplice of the night 
 A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside 
 And something led the way through I couldnt see its face 
 And a voice from deep inside me seemed to get out of this place 
 In my head all was said as the jailor turned the key on me 
 He said youre not running out he said youre not leaving now 
 He said theres no way there is no way 
 Dont leave your mark on meSomewhere some girl is crazy 
 And some boys half out of his head 
 Somewhere somebodys fearless 
 And someone wont wind up dead 
 Somewhere two hearts are pounding 
 And they dont care whats correct 
 Somewhere somebodys fallin in love 
 Without a background check 
 Son Im Mr PC believe you and me 
 Im the ultimate king of correct 
 And if you wanna make it you gotta make her take it 
 As a sign of your deep respect 
 If youre gonna do it you gotta see through it 
 To the heavenly trust that it is 
 Then you can call her a slut 
 And you can call her a slave 
 If you remember to call her Ms

 Fade outFrom the very first moment I saw you 
 I knew our love would be so strong 
 And from the very first moment I kissed you 
 I knew our joy would last so long 
 And then I saw you making love to my best friend 
 I didnt know whatever to say 
 I saw you making love to my best friend 
 So I looked him right in his eyes and I said 
 Listen boy 
 Why dont you take some more its what you came for 
 And dont mind me I wont throw you no curve 
 Have yourself a ball with my good woman 
 Why dont you take some more boy its more than you deserve 
 When I saw you hanging round the truck stop 
 Shining like an angel in the night 
 And when I saw you crying like a baby 
 I knew youd have to be my wife 
 Go on have yourself a ball with my good woman 
 Now I think Im going to have to leave you 
 Because Im feeling much too weak to share 
 And the pie oh its cut in too many pieces 
 The flavor that I crave is no longer there 
 And then I saw you making love to two of my best friends 
 I saw you making love to a group of my best friends 
 So I looked them right in his eyes and I said 
 Listen here group 
 Why dont you take some more boys its more than you deserve 
 Why dont you take some more boys its more than you deserveI want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 Its all or nothin 
 And nothins all I ever get 
 Every time I turn it I burn it up and burn it out 
 Theres always something 
 Theres always something going wrong 
 Thats the only guarantee thats what this is all about 
 Its a never ending attack 
 Everythings a lie and thats a fact 
 Life is a lemon and I want my money back 
 And all the morons 
 And all the stooges with their coins 
 Their the ones who make the rules its not a game its just a rout 
 Theres desperation theres desperation 
 Theres desperation in the air 
 It leaves a stain on all your clothes and no detergent gets it out 
 And were always slippin through the cracks 
 Then the movies over fade to black 
 Then the movies over fade to black 
 Life is a lemon and I want my money back 
 What about love 
 Its defective 
 Its always breakin in half 
 What about sex 
 Its never built to really last 
 What about your family 
 All the batteries are shot 
 What about your friends 
 Their defective 
 All the parts are out of stock 
 What about your god 
 They forgot the warranty 
 What about your town 
 Its a dead end street to me 
 What about your school 
 Its a pack of useless lies 
 What about your work 
 Its a crock and then you die 
 What about hope 
 Its corroded and decayed 
 What about faith 
 Its tattered and itI was nothing but a lonely boy 
 Looking out for something new 
 And you were nothing but a lonely girl 
 But you were something 
 Something like a dream come true 
 I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block 
 When I played my guitar I made the canyons rock 
 But every Saturday Night 
 I felt the fever grow 
 Do ya know what its like 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 And in the middle of a steamy night 
 Im tossing in my sleep 
 And in the middle of a redeyed dream 
 I see you coming 
 Coming on to give it to me 
 Well I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track 
 And like a son of a jackal Im the leader of the pack 
 But every Saturday night 
 Oh baby Im a hunter in the dark of the forest 
 Ive been stalking you and tracking you down 
 Cruising up and down the main drag all night long 
 We could be standing at the top of the world 
 Instead of sinking further down in the mud 
 You and me round about midnight 
 Someone got to draw first draw first 
 Someone got to draw first blood 
 Ooh I got to draw first blood 
 I was nothing but a lonely allAmerican boy 
 Looking out for something to do 
 And you were nothing but a lonely allAmerican girl 
 But you were something like a dream come true 
 And when I played my guitar I made the canyons rock 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 All revved up with no place to goId never tell you one lie Id never let you down 
 Id never leave Id be the one whod always be around 
 Baby give me a chance 
 Id pull the sun down from the sky to light your darkest night 
 I wouldnt let one drop of rain fall down into your life 
 Put your heart in my hands 
 Baby believe me I could never do you wrong 
 And I would never paint your world blue 
 And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind 
 I might be crazy but Im crazy bout you 
 Id lie for you and thats the truth 
 Do anything you asked me to 
 Id even sell my soul for you 
 Id do it all for you 
 If youd just believe in me 
 Just take a look in my eyes youll see a love thats blind 
 Just take a hold of my hand Ill take you to paradise 
 Aint a star thats too far 
 Your every wish will be a wish that I will make come true 
 And if you want the moon I swear Ill bring it down for you 
 Let me into your heart 
 Believe me baby got your name carved on my soul 
 Cause youre the only one that Ill give it too 
 Go letem say that Im a fool to act this way 
 Cause if Im crazy Im just crazy bout you 
 Do anything you ask me to 
 Ill even sell my soul for you 
 Ill do it all for you 
 If you just believe in me 
 Move mountains if you want me to 
 Id walk across the fire for you 
 Id walk on the wild for you 
 And you will never see a day Ill ever break your heart 
 Youll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far 
 Ill show you heaven every second that youre in my arms 
 Baby Im crazy but Im crazy bout you 
 Id lie for you and thats the truthAnother New York waltz at four AM 
 In the canyons lost at night 
 The citys just a jail for me 
 Full of high rise prison walls 
 And Im riding through the darkness 
 Cause I know theres life within 
 And Im searching through the shadows 
 Just to find that light again 
 Keep Driving Keep Driving 
 Let the meter run 
 Oh the nights not really done 
 Keep Driving 
 And Im hanging on a memory and I feel it in the air 
 Im a prisoner of these lonely streets but I know Ill find you 
 There 
 And oh Lord you look so pretty but you can see it in my eyes 
 And just before my tear will fall oh you smile and get inside 
 It seems so real until the light turns green 
 Dont wake me up dont ruin this dream 
 Dont take me from my scene 
 I cant go home dont take me home 
 I cant go home alone 
 They dont tell you when the music stops 
 Or how the movie ends 
 Is it too late once the feelings gone 
 To back it up and start it all again 
 Oh Lord you look so pretty 
 But you can see it in my eyes 
 And just before my tear will fall 
 Oh you smile and get inside 
 I cant go home 
 Dont take me home 
 Keep Driving let the meter run 
 Keep Driving Dont take me homeHave you a heart that beats 
 Have you a breath to breathe 
 And have you veins that bleed 
 Have you a brain that dreams 
 Is it so hard to see that were all the same machine 
 Dont we all live and die under the same blue skyWell I went home with the waitress 
 You know the way I always do 
 Well how was I to know 
 She was with the Russians too 
 I was gambling in Havana 
 You know I took a little risk 
 Send lawyers guns and money 
 Daddy wont you get me out of this 
 Im an innocent bystander 
 Somehow I got stuck 
 Between a rock and a hard place 
 And Im down on my luck 
 Oh yea Im down on my luck 
 Oh baby Im down on my luck 
 Im so far down I dont think Ill ever get up 
 If it werent for bad luck 
 Oh if it werent for bad luck 
 I wouldnt have no luck at all 
 Now Im stranded in Honduras 
 Im a desperate man 
 The shit has hit the fan 
 Get me out of this 
 You know the shit has hit the fanLie tell me a lie 
 Tell me youd like to stay for a while 
 Leave before you leave 
 Make me believe theres still something left 
 And say maybe our hearts could heal or break 
 This could go either way 
 Lets be in love 
 Lets go upstairs till weve both had enough 
 Theres no tomorrow 
 Or yesterday oh my my 
 Lets be in love tonight 
 Time life is just time 
 Leaves on a vine 
 Pasted or wasted away 
 Tried god knows we tried 
 Taking our sides 
 And played it so safe 
 Maybe our hearts could heal or break 
 Theres not tomorrow 
 Or yesterday of my my 
 Lets close the door 
 Lets be indiscreet 
 Lets be the flesh and the sweat on the sheets 
 Lets fill the darkness with passion and grace 
 Lets leave a mark that will never erase 
 God knows what well be by the morning light 
 Now come on over here 
 Lets go upstairs til weve both had enough 
 Lets be in love tonightThe sea is whipping the sky 
 The sky is whipping the sea 
 You can hide away forever from the storm 
 But youll never hide away from me 
 The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark 
 And we may lose everything in the wind 
 But the Northern Lights are burning 
 And theyre giving off sparks 
 I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin 
 You know Im onto your scent 
 Were near the end of the chase 
 Take a look out your window and Ill be there in the night 
 Your love is so close that I can almost taste it 
 Youve been living your life like a girl in a cage 
 And you whisper when I want you to shout 
 And I wonder why you wanna go on sleeping 
 When theres nothing left to dream about 
 But you better remember 
 If its something I want then its something I need 
 I wasnt built for comfort I was built for speed 
 And I know that Im gonna be like this forever 
 Im never gonna be what I should 
 And you think that Ill be bad for just a little while 
 But I know that Ill be bad for good 
 I know that Ill be bad for good 
 Your eyes are darker than sin 
 And Ive been watching them glow 
 Take a chance on a promise and a roll of the dice 
 Put your foot on the gas let it go let it go let it go 
 And wonder why you wanna go on sleeping 
 Bad for good 
 For the good of some thrills on a long frigid night 
 For the good of the fire in your soul 
 For the good of the kiss let me hold you so tight 
 For the good of getting out of control 
 For the good of the action and a race in the dark 
 For the good of those chills up your spine 
 For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart 
 For the good of whats yours and whats mine 
 For the good of believing in a life after birth 
 For the good of your body so bright 
 For the good of the search for some heaven on earth 
 For the good of one hell of a night 
 For the good of one hell of a night for the good of one hell of a night 
 God speed 
 God speed speed us away 
 Ill be bad for good God speed 
 Speed us away speed us away speed us away speed us away 
 The sea is whipping the sky 
 I know that you can be bad 
 At least a little while 
 But if you give me a chance give me one little chance 
 And give me all the love that you should 
 Then instead of being bad for just a little while 
 Im gonna make you bad for good 
 I know that youll be bad for good 
 Youll be bad for goodSomewhere a redeyed waitress glances 
 At another movie magazine 
 Down on the corner theres a grocery boy 
 Stuffin boxes fulla hungry dreams 
 Someone is cleanin up the offices 
 One window burnin in the dark 
 Somebodys cryin is there any way in hell 
 To light a comet from a single spark 
 Workin so hard I cant remember much 
 About the freedom I been workin for 
 Felt like a prisoner til I looked in your eyes 
 And saw a million wide open door 
 Ya tell me put a little money away 
 Every dogll have his day in time 
 Well I been slavin like a dog and I got nothin to show ya 
 But a collar and a fist fulla nickels and dimes 
 I want a piece 
 A piece a the action 
 Gimme a shot at the real thing 
 I want a piece a the action 
 Gonna turn on the master 
 Gonna cut these strings 
 Been livin just like my old man did 
 And neither one of us could get it right 
 Punchin in when the day begins 
 And punchin out the local boys at night 
 Theres someone leavin on a peelin porch 
 And someone leavin on a silver plane 
 I finally know the man Id rather be 
 Girl I wont be back to getcha til they know my name 
 They hand you a paycheck every week 
 And steal a piece of your soul every day 
 Well I dont need no gold watch in fifty years 
 Baby lets be golden today 
 Somewhere a redeyed waitress glances 
 Stuffin boxes fulla hungry dreams I was so hypnotized by the smile in your eyes today 
 Flying free as a bird caught in every word you say 
 I wont ever want to see you 
 This is big time 
 This is larger than life 
 See the sparks fly when your standing by my side 
 Every step every move everything I do 
 Life is beautiful because of you 
 Every breathe that you give 
 You are my sweet oxygen I breathe 
 You made me fall away fast 
 So my dreams could get pass the end 
 I wont ever want to feel 
 How did I survive before you came into my life 
 Id do anything at all 
 Anything at all 
 For you 
 Life is beautiful because of youBoy 
 Theres a hole in the sky tonight 
 Did the moon drift too far from sight 
 I would search through this empty darkness 
 To see your face in the morning light 
 Weve been lost in a sea of confusion 
 Got caught up in a selfish illusion 
 But make no mistake I will bend till I break 
 Dont let fate make the choice for us 
 What about love that lasts forever 
 What about time to see it through 
 If you dont give you just dont get it 
 What about me 
 What about you 
 Once in a lifetime youll find someone heaven send for you 
 For a lifetime youll feel theres a reason to believe 
 In a love thats meant to be 
 It feels like weve fallen from grace 
 Given up on the higher thing 
 Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find 
 Something to give us wings 
 If you dont give you just dont get it 
 I cant go on another day 
 Comin home and seeing you cryin 
 Cant stand another night 
 Of telling you Im fine when Im dying 
 Forever means nothing 
 To live without you 
 Is reaching for something that never comes through 
 Together is heaven 
 Apart were in hell 
 The time for forgiveness is now 
 Oh once in a lifetime youll find 
 Someone to share your dreams 
 For a lifetime 
 Our love will always set us free 
 Forever well believe 
 I cant forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin 
 And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in 
 It happens once only once in a lifetime 
 On a summer nights surrender with nothing to lose 
 You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you 
 What about love that wont say never 
 When you dont know what you can do 
 If you dont live you just regret it 
 What about loveI took one look and something snapped I said I love your eyes  
 You took my heart you took my breath away  
 I felt my temperature rise you said youve never loved a man this 
 Way 
 That it was heaven you were to stay 
 But now youre just another fallen angel 
 And I hope that the fall didnt do you no harm 
 And now youre just another fallen angel 
 Falling into  somebody elses arms 
 I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise 
 I must admit that when I first laid eyes you had me hypnotized  
 You said Im sorry but I dont say much 
 But Im in heaven when I feel your touch 
 Follow your own road baby Ill be there when you need me 
 To love and to comfort and what he got aint 
 Enough to keep you in the air 
 Angel Ill be thereBam bam bam my sweet 
 You can sip it through a strawyou can throw it back deep 
 Just dont be hesitatin waitin for it 
 Cause in an ideal world theyll be comin for you 
 Could be tokin on the bale could be sniffin out clues 
 Better stake your fakin reputation on it 
 Do it 
 Just do it 
 In a Taxfree zone down a tin can alley 
 Theres a slippergirl and man name Sally 
 They were talktalktalkin bout a clever little coffin nail 
 Seems down at the docks the intended lies awaitin 
 And the privlaged informations gonna get wet too 
 You cant be too careful when it comes to being careful 
 Theres a man in my street keeps a flock of gray doves 
 And hes set in his ways wearin Everlast gloves 
 His opinion can be beat when the push becomes a shove 
 Says he doesnt give a monkey bout the youth of the day 
 They should all drop dead should be taken away 
 Put somewhere cold and all be made to stay 
 Bag it up 
 Do itYoure my savior on your velvet throne 
 Youre lookin pretty with your jewels and bones 
 Standing round with the mud and the stones 
 Gotta come on down and take me home 
 You gotta give me a piece of your pie 
 Cause I been knocking on your window 
 I been knocking on your door 
 And I been trying to get myself inside 
 Dont you know 
 That Im riding the train now 
 Cant feel the pain now 
 Dont even know where I am 
 No turning back now 
 Were on the right track yeah 
 Im chugging just as fast as I can 
 Stoking the fire

 Much higher than when we began 
 Riding on the train of love 
 Train of love train of love 
 Train of love 
 Train of love ooh 
 Tttrain of love 
 Train of love train of love ooh 
 Youre my savior on your Hollywood sky 
 My veins are getting horny and my souls running dry

 You gotta give me some kind of reply

 Gotta have your train of love

 Gotta have your train of love 
 Oh want your train of love

 Riding the train now 
 Oh train of love 
 Dont even know where I amTurn around 
 Every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
 And youre never coming round 
 Turn around 
 Every now and then I get a little bit tired 
 Of listening to the sound of my tears 
 Every now and then I get a little bit nervous 
 That the best of all the years have gone by 
 Every now and then I get a little bit terrified 
 And then I see the look in your eyes 
 Turn around bright eyes 
 Every now and then I fall apart 
 Every now and then I get a little bit restless 
 And I dream of something wild 
 Every now and then I get a little bit helpless 
 And Im lying like a child in your arms 
 Every now and then I get a little bit angry 
 And I know I have to get out and cry 
 But then I see the look in your eyes 
 And I need you now tonight 
 And I need you more than ever 
 And if you only hold me tight 
 Well be holding on forever 
 And well only be making it right 
 Cause well never be wrong 
 Together we can take it to the end of the line 
 Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time 
 All of the time 
 I dont know what to do and Im always in the dark 
 Were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks 
 I really need you tonight 
 Forevers gonna start tonight 
 Forevers gonna start tonight 
 Once upon a time I was falling in love 
 Now Im only falling apart 
 Theres nothing I can do 
 A total eclipse of the heart 
 Once upon a time there was light in my life 
 But now theres only love in the dark 
 Nothing I can say 
 Every now and then I know youll never be the boy 
 You always wanted to be 
 But every now and then I know youll always be the only boy 
 Who wanted me the way that I am 
 Every now and then I know theres no one in the universe 
 As magical and wondrous as you 
 Every now and then I know theres nothing any better 
 Theres nothing that I just wouldnt do 
 And I need you now tonight and I need you 
 And if you only hold me tight if youll only 
 Well be holding on forever 
 And well only be making it right and well never 
 Love is like a shadow on me all of the time 
 I dont know what to do Im always in the dark 
 But now Im only falling apart 
 Nothing I can do 
 Turn aroundI dreamed there was a magic song 
 I played for the queen neath the golden throne 
 My heart flowed through my broken voice to her 
 The queen did smile and she did cry 
 My fingers bled a thousand lives 
 A redteared river flowed our lives between us 
 Her majesties tears and the paupers blood 
 An angels breath and the devils touch 
 The song of madness madly cryin to her 
 Youre a wolf in a lambs disguise 
 A cold lover with a warm invite 
 Mornin gonna carry us to our grave 
 Dream a dream in agony 
 Sweetest dream youll ever see 
 Make my dream reality 
 Oh carry me 
 Carry me to my grave 
 She placed the blade within the kings throne 
 And in mine did I place my own 
 With the lambs blood we purchased our sins pardon 
 The sky ripped open and the shadows bled 
 The moon blew out and the stars burned red 
 On a night such as this 
 An angels lips and the devils kiss 
 The sweetest dream youll ever see 
 Make my dream reality and carry me 
 The song of madness shot like lightning through us 
 Madness 
 My God my Queen just lie to me 
 Make me believe that I am king and by morning 
 Youre a wolf in a lambs disguise 
 Oh carry e 
 Carry me 
 Carry me to my graveSome say its wrong some say its right 
 Some say its politicians playing both sides 
 Some say its greed some say its change 
 Some say its all just the price well have to pay 
 And I feel a storm coming in 
 And I see the earth bending in the wind 
 Its gonna rain yeah 
 Wash it all away yeah 
 And it aint gonna stop 
 No it aint gonna stop 
 For forty days 
 Some say its fate some say its chance 
 Some say its the blood of our fathers on our hands 
 Some say its a lie some say its the truth 
 Some say its all coming down on me and you 
 And I see a fire in the sky 
 And I hear the thunder out on the edge of night 
 Some say the stars will fall down from heaven 
 Some say the angels will cry and ask us why 
 Its gonna rain yeah 
 Its gonna rain 
 Oh its gonna rain 
 Its gonna rain rain rain yeah 
 Wash it all away 
 Its gonna rain for forty days 
 Its gonna rain 
 Its gonna rainI was standing with my paper there minding my own news 
 For everything that someone said someone else had a different view 
 I watched the whole thing there unfold upon my TV screen 
 A new world order is on its way well just pass the popcorn please 
 You dont mean to tell me no one else is gonna get hurt 
 When theres folks at home who eat dog food and they cant afford a shirt 
 Sure find out real fast just whos a sitting duck 
 When its a 
 Mad mad worldshake your hands and say good luck 
 Mad mad worldI cannot believe this stuff 
 Mad mad worldgetting madder every day 
 Mad mad worldget involved and theyll blow you away 
 Sure find out real fast when youre a sitting duck 
 Well its a mad mad world 
 A little man sits up way high way up above the crowd 
 Can you make them dance real fast can you make them cheer out loud 
 Money doesnt talk and yet it sounds like a big machine 
 A voice on high says you reap what you sow just keep your own nose clean 
 Sure find out real fast just when youve had enough 
 Mad mad world  
 The Good God Is A Woman And She Dont Like Ugly 
 Chuck D 
 Shell knock you right off this planet 
 To those opposed and take it for granted 
 Who knows it grows from those that planned it 
 Who ran for office and they cant stand it 
 Who robbed and stole and took full advantage 
 And hide the shock with all them antics 
 Whose souls exposed cause I dig granite 
 We rock and roll they dont understand it 
 And damn the wack cause they dont want it 
 Your gold and diamonds so what you bought it 
 You dont know what I know you just sport it 
 Bodyguards scared but you still flaunt it 
 People died in them mines and they just caught it 
 Sly slick the wicked do you support it 
 Kicking ask me the questions yall know I taught it 
 Want war Shut up Cause you aint fought it 
 Cmon 
 Terrrible 
 Power to the people 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Terrible 
 Cmon 
 Mad Mad World 
 That its a mad mad world 
 Well its a mad mad worl 
 Mad mad worldTo say its love would be too simple 
 Too obvious 
 Its more like a calling a vocation 
 Something I was 
 Put on this earth to do 
 Now Im shooting with the stars 
 And Im flying with the angels 
 And my heartbeat is a symphony the 
 Closer I get to you 
 I never saw you comin till you 
 Came and here you are 
 I never thought someone 
 Would ever dare 
 To come this far 
 Youre up for the resistance 
 And Im strong in my persistence 
 And Ive never known 
 A remedy like ours 
 If I cant have you 
 I would be a river dried up 
 Into dust 
 I would be imprisoned 
 For ever having loved 
 I dont wanna be me 
 Then I would be the same man 
 You scraped off the ground 
 Id have to go back bein 
 That broken soul you found 
 Those days are in the darkness 
 I buried them with hardness 
 And Id have to dig those 
 Demons out 
 Your life is like anchor that puts 
 Me in my place 
 No you wont let me sink when 
 Im off losin my way 
 Thank God for your virtue 
 And the wisdom in your eye 
 Cause somehow you 
 Get through on 
 All that crazy in my mind 
 I would be a river 
 Dried up into dust 
 I would be imprisoned for never 
 Having loved 
 Why did it take you so long to 
 Finally see 
 That we had a love 
 That you dont find easily 
 You broke my heart and the price 
 To pay for that 
 Is youll have to live the misery of 
 Losing what you had 
 My words have come to late 
 Ive already turned that page 
 Dont you look at me that way 
 Cause youll pull me back and 
 Thats the part I hate 
 Ill stay trapped inside my hell 
 Where its so hot 
 That my walls melt 
 And I can hear a promise 
 In every lie you said 
 Youd never tell 
 If I had only told the truth 
 Oh I could never trust you to 
 Youll survive 
 No I will die 
 Then Im sorry for the things I 
 Cost you in the end 
 My punishment is more than any 
 Man can stand 
 I need you in my life 
 I cant let go 
 Why dont you stay with me 
 Tonight 
 I feel alone 
 Turn off all the lights 
 Take me home 
 Then I would be a river 
 To say its love would be too simpleI swallowed the end of the world with my problems 
 Thought maybe a girl could solve em 
 Dont let anyone in 
 Im stuck with these sins 
 Im hoping maybe time can absolve em 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed to run free 
 Well thats all through 
 Thought I was runnin from you 
 Turns out I was runnin from me 
 La La La La La La 
 Runnin away from me 
 Runnin from me 
 Theres a girl who lives on my street 
 She said the flowers take care of the bees 
 She says shell bring me a shore 
 Cause Daddys at war 
 Shes gonna take care of me 
 If history is violence and sex 
 Id rather not pay my respects 
 If Ive caused offense 
 Im just trying to talk sense 
 Forgive me if Im too direct 
 Or politically incorrect 
 All thats through 
 Runnin away from meIm still alive 
 Must have been a miracle 
 Its been a hell of ride 
 Destination still unknown 
 Its a fact of life 
 If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head 
 You better walk the line or youll be left for dead 
 Im a runaway train on a broken track 
 Im a ticker on the bomb that you cant turn back this time 
 Thats right 
 I got away with it all and Im still alive 
 Let the end of the world come tumbling down 
 Ill be the last man standing on the ground 
 As long as hot blood runs trough my veins 
 Im still alive 
 Lost in the night 
 Feeling so invisible 
 Oh a dead man walking the wire 
 High above the devils net 
 Thats made of fire 
 And its a long way down from the top of the world 
 You better look around or you gonna get burned 
 And as the dust clears look in my eyes 
 The darkest night aint black enough 
 To keep the morning light from shining 
 The highest wall aint tall enough 
 To keep the smallest man from climbing 
 The more that you resist the tide 
 The more it pulls you in 
 The more you hang on for your life 
 Im a runaway train on a broken track 
 Im a ticker on the bomb that you cant turn back this time 
 Thats right 
 And if my shadows all that survives 
 Im still aliveThe entire city is burning 
 You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox 
 Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests 
 Barbarians prowl in shadows their heads rocking with rodents 
 Motorcycles reproduce in noctournal alleys groaning with greasy pleasure 
 And theyve blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon 
 And sent it out to sea full of screaming lovely lonely girlsEvery night I grab some money and I go down to the bar 
 I got my buddies and a beer I got a dream I need a car 
 You got me begging on my knees cmon and throw the dog a bone 
 A man he doesnt live by rock n roll and brew alone 
 Baby baby 
 Rock n roll and brew 
 They dont mean a thing when I compare em next to you 
 I know that you and I oh we got better things to do 
 I dont know who you are or what you do 
 Or where you go when youre not around 
 I dont know anything about you baby 
 But youre everything Im dreaming of 
 I dont know who you are 
 But youre a real dead ringer for love 
 A real dead ringer for love 
 Ever since I can remember you been hanging around this joint 
 You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point 
 I dont have to know your name and I wont tell you what to do 
 But a girl she doesnt live by only rock n roll and brew 
 Baby baby baby baby 
 Rock n roll and brew 
 Oh You got the kind of legs that do more than walk 
 I dont have to listen to your whimpering talk 
 Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see 
 You got a lotta nerve to come on to me 
 You got the kind of lips that do more than drink 
 You got the kind of mind that does less than think 
 But since Im feeling kinda lonely n my defenses are low 
 Why dont we give it a shot and get it ready to go 
 Im looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction 
 I want to tell my daddy Ill be missing in action 
 Ever since I can remember Ive been hanging round this joint 
 My daddy never noticed now hell finally get the point 
 You got me beggin on my knees cmon and throw the dog a bone 
 I dont know anything about you baby 
 Dead ringer for love 
 dead ringer 
 dead ringerSo this is what it feels like 
 To be the one left behind 
 To give it all youve got then find 
 Youve already changed your mind 
 And this is what it sounds like 
 Crying on the bed that we both made 
 Waiting for a sign that you just cant give me 
 Any kind of sign 
 I dont want to be here wideawake 
 Clinging to a love that cant be saved 
 Hanging off the edge of every word 
 That you say 
 So I asked myself Do I love you so much 
 That Im willing to let you go 
 At the tip of my tongue the answer was yes 
 But at the bottom of my heart Im wondering 
 Did I say that 
 Sometimes you know I over react 
 And what I say is not a matter of fact 
 I wish that I could take it all back 
 And you know Id drag myself through fire at your side 
 And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide 
 And I need some sympathy here 
 And I need someone to call my own 
 Im standing in the light of my mistakes 
 And begging you come home 
 And I know you need some time to run and hide 
 But the truth is hard to swallow when youre choking on your pride 
 But at the back of my mind Im wondering 
 But I said that 
 And I wish I could take it all back 
 And I want a love to call my own 
 I want to take you in the back seat now 
 And slowly drive you home 
 But the truth is hard to swallow when youre 
 Choking on your pride 
 I dont want to be this wideawake 
 Fighting for a love that I cant save 
 And hanging off the edge of every word you say 
 Knowing that it might make me cry 
 I dont want to be this complicating 
 You can drag it out but Ill be waiting 
 I stumbled on I love you tonight 
 But it sounded like goodbye 
 Did I tell you that I loved you cause if 
 Would have been a matter of fact 
 This time Im not letting go 
 This time Ill have and Ill hold 
 Did I tell you that I loved you cause it 
 This time Im walking through fire 
 This time Ill feed your desire 
 This time Ill stand by your side 
 This time I will be your pride 
 And I wish that I could take it all back 
 So this is what it feels like 
 To give it all youve got then find 
 That youve already changed your mindIve lived my life in a cage 
 Freedom spit in my face 
 It was such a disgrace 
 And I was lonely 
 Burnt out and empty 
 Desperate 
 I had my head in a noose 
 I had nothing to lose 
 Had enough of abuse 
 So now Im dangerous 
 Hates so contagious 
 It owns us 
 Im angry Im angry 
 Im raging Im raging 
 Im breaking through the pain 
 The monsters loose 
 And now you know the truth 
 Tell me can you feel it 
 As you hit the wall 
 And now you have to choose 
 And prove that you can take it 
 To the top before you fall 
 Ive walked a slippery road 
 With revenge in my soul 
 Through the wind and the cold 
 With no protection 
 Just one direction 
 Destruction 
 Ive paid for all my mistakes 
 Taken all I can take 
 Till Im ready to break 
 Life can be vicious 
 Its so outrageous 
 It breaks us 
 Im bleeding 
 Still breathing 
 Im tearing through these chains 
 And prove you can take it 
 To the top and never fall 
 Ive lived a thousand years in darkness 
 Banished all alone 
 Inside my mind with just my madness 
 Behind these walls of stone 
 I was falling apart at the seams 
 Holding my breath just to breathe 
 Tasted the sting of my tears 
 I was waking up stuck in a dream 
 Ran out of air couldnt scream 
 Wasted away by my fears 
 Youve lost your last excuse 
 Now show me that youve got it 
 Even if you crawl 
 This game is win or lose 
 The time has come to do it 
 And show the world you want it all 
 Yeahhhhhhaw 
 YeahhhhhhhhhhhawI want you so hard 
 Can you trust me 
 Yes you know you should 
 Now take a chance 
 And I know you should 
 Trust your instincts 
 And let me in 
 Just be my ride 
 And Ill be my friend 
 Oh I love it 
 Yeah you know you should 
 Oh yeah 
 Whoa gotta tell you now 
 The boys bad newsWell Im looking at the man in the broken glass 
 Theres a crack where his heart was beating last 
 Oh I can tell hes been through hell 
 I say never stop dreaming 
 Oh yesterdays gone 
 Tomorrow is the day 
 Oh were not dying 
 Were just paving the way 
 For the lovers the dreamers 
 The kids who say 
 Never stop living 
 Oh never stop living 
 Cause if it rains it rains 
 Well be in the street looking thunder in the face 
 Singing na na na na na 
 I wont change 
 Oh like water in your lungs 
 They try to shut you down 
 Take your good ideas 
 And your shout out louds 
 But they dont know 
 The movements growing 
 Well never stop breathing 
 Oh never before and never again 
 Will there be a moment like this my friend 
 To make a change 
 Stand up and say 
 No never stop living 
 If it rains it rains 
 Singing nan na na na na 
 Oh if it rains it rains 
 Oh no now 
 Oh if it rains it rainsIf you listen to the night 
 You can hear the darkness call 
 I can barely stand to wait 
 I can barely stand at all 
 Cmon closer to me now 
 Its like were sharing the same skin 
 We gotta get out of this jail 
 We gotta let the future in 
 So many things in your life 
 That youre bound to regret 
 Why didnt I do that 
 Why didnt I do this 
 So many chances you lost 
 That youll never forget 
 Why didnt I make it 
 Why didnt I take it right there 
 The loneliest words youll ever know 
 If onlyif only it was so 
 The emptiest words that theyll ever be 
 It couldve been me 
 Youll have to pay for it later 
 If you dont get it when its going for free 
 Believe me  
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 Its something thats always been so 
 And one of these nights 
 Youre gonna show me that you already know 
 Theres a feast waiting for you 
 And youve never even gotten a taste 
 Its later than you think and 
 You shouldnt tremble when we touch 
 Theres no reason for these fears 
 Its a promise that was made 
 Weve been promised this for years 
 I wanna show you it all 
 What to do and where and how 
 Because well never be as young as we are right now 
 Well never be as young as we are right now 
 So many cries in the night 
 That you try to ignore 
 So many unanswered prayers 
 So many unopened doors 
 Why didnt I take it 
 Why didnt I make it come true 
 Believe me 
 Believe me believe me 
 Im gonna show you that you already know 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 Its all were leaving behind 
 It doesnt matter what were losing 
 Its only matters what were going to find 
 Lets get away from the past 
 Only matters what were going to find 
 So many ways it could pass 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to wasteOn a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses 
 Will he offer me his mouth 
 Yes 
 Will he offer me his teeth 
 Will he offer me his jaws 
 Will he offer me his hunger 
 Again will he offer me his hunger 
 And will he starve without me 
 And does he love me 
 On a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses 
 I bet you say that to all the boys 
 It was a hot summer night the beach was burning 
 There was fog crawling over the sand 
 Oh when I listen to your heart I hear the whole world turning 
 I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands 
 Oh you were licking your lips and your lipsticks shining 
 I was dying just to ask for a taste 
 Oh we were lying together in a silver lining 
 By the the light of the moon you know theres not another moment 
 Not another moment 
 Not another moment to waste 
 Oh well you hold me so close that my knees grow weak 
 But my soul is flying high above the ground 
 Im trying to speak but no matter what I do 
 I just cant seem to make any sound 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh and I swear its true 
 I was just about to say I love you 
 love you 
 Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water 
 And I guess that Im beginning to grin 
 Oh were finally alone and we can do what we want to 
 Oh the night is young aint no one gonna know where 
 No one gonna know where 
 No ones gonna know where youve been 
 By the the light of the moon you know theres not another moment to waste 
 Must have been while you were kissing me 
 Oh you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh oh oh 
 You took the words right out of my mouthLong distance callin in the middle of a rainy night 
 So much static hardly knew your voice 
 Youve been cryin want me to love you like I did before 
 Girl when it comes to you you know I got no choice 
 You put a storm inside me 
 Oughta head for a safer harbor 
 They all tell me I should give you up 
 Well no man coulda tried any harder 
 Feels like an odyssey thats never gonna reach an end 
 Every time I hear you callin to me 
 Just wanna feel you in my arms again 
 Like a sailor to a siren 
 Like a moth to a flame 
 I know your love might be the death of me 
 But I run to you just the same 
 Nothins gonna keep us apart 
 Crashin over the wreckage of all the sailors broken hearts 
 Musta met you when we were livin in another time 
 Had nothin but the jealous Gods to point our way 
 When we were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore 
 Wailin like a siren leadin him astray 
 I got another woman and I know you got another man 
 But I dont think that any mortal can 
 Gonna abandon ship 
 Gonna steal you from the cliff 
 Take you to a place where the Gods cant find us no more 
 Let the sailors listen to the sirens if they dare 
 Gonna be dancin on the water 
 Drownin in your yellow hairIve got steel on my fingers 
 Granite on my breathe 
 A bottle in one ear 
 And a spike in my chest 
 A nickel in my boot 
 And my finger in a dam 
 I hang out with a bunch 
 Of losers I call my friends 
 And we sing 
 Ooh 
 But Im headin out today 
 Im goin down Elijahs way 
 Spinnin wheels on fire 
 With my speed needle between my jeans 
 So darlin show me what youre hiding 
 Behind that ring 
 Behind your pink silhouette young lust balcony 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 We got twothousand miles between here and home 
 They wont even know were gone 
 I got mamas smile and my daddys gun 
 You got your honest face and your liars tongue 
 Until Armageddon takes me 
 Its just you and me baby 
 Runnin like the only sinners left 
 Lovin like the only sinners left 
 Livin like the only sinners left alive 
 Livin on the outside 
 Ive got one shot to steal this world 
 If you wanna go with me you can be my girl 
 Heres a bullet for your thoughts 
 And a penny for the train 
 Next time Im here theyll be diggin my grave 
 If I gotta go then Im goin in style 
 Youre gonna find me rinnin down that calvary mile 
 A beggars son on a potters tree 
 They dont even know were gone 
 I got my mamas smile and my daddys gun 
 Bring your honest face and your liars tongue 
 Livin like the only sinners left 
 Lovin like the only sinners left alive 
 Livin on the outsideAnd Ill go blind before I stop 
 And Ill go blind before I stop 
 Theyre gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rock 
 Theres a two ton fireball 
 Burnin though the headphones 
 Cuttin up my heart 
 Makin ashes of my soul 
 A lightning bolt petition 
 Tonight Im gonna sign 
 Trouble out my window 
 And Im gonna find it 
 And Im feelin the fever 
 Takin in the heat 
 Movin to the boogie 
 Hittin to the beat 
 Wrapped in rhythm 
 Dancin till we drop 
 And Ill go blind before I stop 
 Moonlite madness masquerade 
 Got my invitation baby time to play 
 Rip off the headphones 
 Shove my arm into the socket 
 Sound comes rushing through me 
 Like an intravenous rocket 
 Doin it in the market 
 Doin it in the mall 
 Doin it in the bushes 
 And the high school hall 
 Doin it in the alley 
 Doin it for free 
 Now their doin it baby 
 On MTV 
 Doin it in the backseat 
 Doin it on the beack 
 Doin it in the grandstand 
 Just dancin on the seats 
 Doin it in the movies 
 Doin it on the train 
 Doin it mile high 
 In a big jet plane 
 Just wants to rockListen 
 I was born on the other side 
 Just always looking to you 
 I made it over the great divide 
 Now Im coming for you 
 Your forces lined up in battle 
 Your soldiers and your machines 
 The sun been blacked out by shadows 
 The darkest hour now youve ever seen 
 And Im easy and Im serious 
 They try and tear me down 
 You want me baby I dare you 
 Try and tear me down 
 I rose up on the doctors slab 
 Like Lazarus from the pit 
 And everyone wants to take a stab 
 Decorate me with blood graffiti and spit 
 Ive been held up on money 
 Ive been beaten out of spite 
 You want a piece of me honey 
 Lose or win 
 You know youve been in a fight 
 On March 6th 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell to the Mexican army After a 12day siege the troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the war Its further from El Paso to Texarkana then from New York to Chicago And when it joined the Union Texas was the biggest state Yeah everything from Texas is big larger than life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday So big his daddy called him Meat Loaf He grew into a big man with a big voice And he sings big songs and has big hits You can try and tear him down 
 Now there aint much difference 
 Between a bridge and a wall 
 Without me right in the middle baby 
 Youll be nothing at all 
 Try and tear me downShell be the first to say she was blind 
 To how much life can hurt sometimes 
 She learned the hard way that life aint fair 
 Its times like these you gasp for air 
 She looks at pictures in the magazines 
 Its all smiles and lipstick and beauty queens 
 That simple life makes her cry because 
 She remembers when hers was 
 And one more tear falls in the river 
 She watches it wash away 
 And one more prayer flies up to heaven 
 Just begging for a change 
 And one more song no one else is singing 
 Shes got to sing it anywayalone 
 Another sun becomes a moon 
 She makes it through another day 
 For me I think the hardest part 
 Is just watching while she falls apart 
 I try but we both know its true 
 There aint a damn thing I can do 
 Every now and then I hear her laugh 
 It makes me think she might be coming back 
 Tell her we miss her 
 Shes gone gone 
 Shes gone again 
 She makes it through another dayHeaven blesses those who wait 
 Patience is a virtue son 
 Keep your toe on the line 
 Keep your foot on the brake 
 No sense jumpin the gun 
 Girl Im tired of waitin you know lifes too short 
 Lemme kiss ya til the night is done 
 Aint no doubt about it youre my favorite sport 
 God I wanna jump the gun 
 Feel like jumpin the gun 
 Tonight Im gonna jump the gun 
 No crime in havin some fun 
 How about jumpin the gun 
 They say it doesnt matter if ya win or lose 
 Only matters how ya play the game 
 Well let me tell ya baby if I had to choose 
 Gotta win ya know or go insane 
 Willya hold me like a trophy 
 Willya burn up the track 
 Willya love me when the titles won 
 Blow away the competition baby 
 Never look back 
 Tonight Im gonna jump 
 Better get ready 
 Better get set girl 
 This time were jumpin the gun 
 Ya think were goin too fast 
 Aint sen nothin yet girl 
 Ready take your mark 
 Oh I just cant wait 
 Ygotta break a couple rules 
 If ya wanna break the tape 
 This time were jumpin the gunYou say youre all alone 
 And after all the changes youve been through today 
 You can use a little tenderness right now 
 OK  Ive been alone 
 And I can understand the way you feel tonight 
 Maybe together we can change it all right now 
 I can tell by the look in your tearfilled eyes 
 You need somebody you can hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 Id love to hold you 
 Then Id love to be the body 
 That you hold onto 
 You say he broke your heart 
 He left you crying but he didnt set you free 
 And now you feel like you can never love again 
 OK  so let me know 
 Its up to you how long you let his memory stay 
 And do you really want to carry on this way 
 Then I really cant deny you 
 So many things you need to know 
 So many left to say 
 But you mean more than words I know 
 I can help you chase the pain away 
 Oh if you really want toIf a love as strong as ours 
 Couldnt make it all the way 
 Can anything make sense at all 
 If a love so deep and true 
 Couldnt stand the test of time 
 Then Mount Everest could slide and Jerusalem could fall 
 Is nothing sacred anymore 
 Is forever just another word 
 Is a promise something people used to keep 
 When love was worth fighting for 
 If we can say goodbye 
 I can hear the final words 
 Every sentence that was said 
 Dont know what turned our lives around 
 It doesnt matter who was right 
 Theres no justice in a dream 
 Never thought a heart could break without making any sound 
 Is forever just another word 
 And you thought that Id saved you 
 Couldve sworn that you saved me 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymoreAnd I never really sleep anymore and I always get those dangerous dreams 
 And I never get a minute of peace and I gotta wonder what it means 
 And I gotta wonder what it means 
 Maybe its nothing and Im under the weather 
 Maybe its just one of those bugs going round 
 Maybe Im under a spell and its magic 
 Maybe theres a witch doctor with an office in town 
 Chorus 
 Oh is this a blessing or is it a curse 
 Does it get any better Can it get any worse 
 Will it go on forever or is it over tonight 
 Does it come with the darkness Does it bring out the light 
 Is it richer than diamonds or just a little cheaper than spit 
 I dont know what it is 
 I dont know what it is but it just wont quit 
 And there used to be such an easy way of living 
 And there used to be every hope in the world 
 And I used to get everything that I went after 
 But there never used to be this girl but there never used to be this girl 
 Maybe Im crazy and Im losing my senses 
 Maybe Im possessed by a spirit or such 
 Maybe Im desperate and Ive got no defenses 
 Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch 
 Its a stairway to heaven or a subway going down to the pits 
 Is it some kind of love 
 Solo 
 chorus 
 I dont know what it is I dont know what it is but it just wont quit 
 repeats 4x 
 There was a time when nothing ever really mattered 
 There was a time when there was nothing I didnt know 
 There was a time when I knew just what I was living for 
 There was a time and the time was so long ago 
 And I never really sleep anymoreI sit in my living room thinking of you 
 And the feelings I fear are coming true 
 And everything about you is wrong I know it 
 But I still taste you on my tongue 
 And I still breathe you in my lungs 
 And I wish I could stop breaking down 
 Wish I could love you out loud 
 Wish I could love you out loud 
 But Ill just keep it to myself 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds 
 To be with you and no one else 
 Dont make a sound 
 Dont tell a soul 
 Its 7am and I just wanna call you and tell you Im falling in love 
 But theres somebody else inside these four walls 
 She smells you on my skin 
 And I I cant let her know where Ive been 
 And I wish I could be with you now 
 Because Im under your spell 
 Wish I could tell the whole world 
 But Ill just keep it to myself 
 Dont tell a soul 
 Dont tell them anything and I wont let you go 
 Dont say a word 
 And I shiver at the thought of you 
 I cant believe that you love me too and we quiver when we touch 
 I cant believe I love you so much 
 And I hate it when you walk away 
 I know we cant go on this way 
 But theres magic when we touch 
 Wish I could love you out loud 
 Which I could hear how it sounds 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds 
 Because Im under your spell 
 Dont make a sound 
 Dont tell a soul 
 Dont tell them anything and I wont let you go 
 Dot say a word 
 Dont tell them anything and I wont let you go 
 But ill just keep it to myself 
 Dont make a sound 
 Wish I could love you out loudI caught a glimpse of myself today 
 Wasnt a pretty picture I must say 
 Well I threw a dagger of poison words straight for my heart 
 Was it deserved 
 Well its too late to make up some excuse and say it wasnt me 
 Well whats the use 
 Oh youve seen too much 
 Ooh let me introduce you to 
 This is my anger 
 This is my shame 
 These are my insecurities that I cant explain 
 This is my fortress crumbling round my feet 
 Take a good look baby this is all of me 
 They found that nerve deep in my soul 
 Poised and ready to explode 
 And no one else on earth but you could get close enough 
 To light that fuse 
 And you crawled up underneath my skin 
 Crept now through my veins and through my head 
 Ooh you got so deep 
 You might as well get to know the rest of me 
 We all live under the same roof 
 We go by the same name 
 It saddens me to think that I cannot turn back the hands of time 
 Take a good look baby 
 These are my doubts 
 These are my emotions all strung out 
 Take a good look baby this is allthis is all of me 
 This is all of me 
 Oh this is all of me 
 This is all of meLoves an hourglass 
 It goes out wide and it comes in closer 
 Time ticks away drifts away 
 Leaving empty sanded shoulders oh to cry on 
 Who said that love could last forever 
 Im growing tired of feeling like I do 
 As we drift apart 
 Little secrets come between us 
 As we sail away 
 Im feeling comfort in the distance 
 You said that love would last forever 
 You said that love would last forever 
 Oh but neither one of us will ever surrender 
 Never surrender 
 Theres a time theres a place 
 A change of heart about face 
 This is about love its about forgiveness 
 Oh 
 Tell me now tell me like it is 
 You dont have to give 
 Amnesty is granted 
 Whats done is done for everyone 
 Come on baby lets start again right now 
 Amnesty amnesty amnesty is granted 
 Neither one of us will ever surrender 
 No one has to give 
 Come on baby I wanna start again right now 
 Oh I been thinkin about you

 Amnesty is granted 
 Tell me now come on babe and tell me like it is

 Tonight is right for love with Meredith BaxterBirney 
 Expressin love so sweet 
 Ill keep you burnin like a dog in heat 
 We had a love that was so magical 
 Meredith BaxterBurnin burnin burnin in my soul 
 Im not talking about Meredith BaxterBirney today no 
 Im talking about Meredith BaxterBirney that was on Family Ties two years ago 
 Meat Loaf 
 After the love comes the darkness of Hell 
 A demon inside you like a bottomless well 
 Nothing is safe and everything is a lie 
 Love doesnt last no matter how hard you try 
 Burnin burnin through your brain unthinkable pain 
 Chef 
 Meat 
 When you finally realize that its all in vain 
 Meat Loaf 
 Splinters of wood they get forced through your eyes 
 Cheese graters of steel being rubbed on your thighs 
 Your skins comin off and youre rollin in salt 
 Meat Hey Meat Meat Loaf 
 What 
 Where you goin son 
 Oh gosh 
 Come back to us were over here 
 Yeah OK Oh sorry Chef man Sorry 
 OK son but this song is about Meredith BaxterBirney all right But not about splinters of wood in your eye 
 Youre right

 Oh taco great I need a taco 
 Messin up my business with Meredith BaxterBirney OK

 Chef and Meat Loaf 
 The rain is fallin and Jay Leno is on 
 Lets turn down the lights turn up the volume and go crazy 
 Ill touch your body and soul 
 And change the channels with remote control 
 Cause tonight is right for love with Meredith BaxterBirneyThere are things I have come to believe 
 Since the new resurrection of love 
 There are visions I finally see 
 There are signs everywhere theyre below and above 
 There are things that I finally know 
 There are secrets and dreams never seen in the light 
 We are suddenly plunged in the dark 
 Our soul is a beast that goes bump in the night 
 There are endless nights 
 They just go on forever 
 There are scars on scars 
 That I know will never heal 
 Theres relentless pain 
 It tortures me forever 
 Ive got to pretend it aint real 
 But at least it only hurts 
 At least it only hurts  only when I feel 
 It hurts only when I feel And the band began to play 
 Without a song they lose their way 
 A song of love and custom dreams 
 A song of yesterday 
 When they danced 
 Her skirts were lifted high 
 She felt the music in his arms 
 The danger in his eyes 
 And a woman said 
 No 
 And a man said But I love you so 
 And a woman moved closer 
 And a man said Take my love into your heart 
 I must have you here by my side 
 It happened all too fast 
 They came to love and they came to last 
 Noone remembers now who lied 
 True love is made of glass 
 Change 
 And a man said As soon as I can 
 Open up 
 And a man said Your way is right 
 Youre my love I want to be holdin you down 
 In the evening of their lives 
 No regrets and clear blue skies 
 They met again in old New York 
 He tells he one sweet lie 
 And a man said I love you so 
 I must have you here by my sideI was lost till you were found 
 But I never knew how far down 
 I was falling 
 Before I reached the bottom 
 I was cold and you were fire 
 And I never knew how the pyre 
 Could be burning 
 On the edge of the ice field 
 And now the chilly Californian wind 
 Is blowing down our bodies again 
 And were sinking deeper and deeper 
 In the chilly Californian sand 
 Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart 
 And cant you see my faded Levis bursting apart 
 And dont you hear me crying 
 Oh Babe dont go 
 And dont you hear me screaming 
 How was I to know 
 Im in the middle of nowhere 
 Near the end of the line 
 But theres a border to somewhere waiting 
 And theres a tankful of time 
 Oh give me just another moment 
 To see the light of the day 
 And take me to another land 
 Where I dont have to stay 
 And Im gonna need somebody 
 To make me feel like you do 
 And I will receive somebody 
 With open arms open eyes 
 Open up the sky and let the planet 
 That I love shine through 
 For crying out loud 
 You know I love you 
 I was damned and you were saved 
 And I never knew how enslaved 
 I was kneeling 
 In the chains of my master 
 I could laugh but you could cry 
 And I never knew just how high 
 I was flying 
 Ah with you right above me 
 And dont you here me crying 
 For taking in the rain when Im feeling so dry 
 For giving me the answers when Im asking you why 
 My oh my for that I thank you 
 For taking in the sun when Im feeling so cold 
 For giving me a child when my body is old 
 Dont you know for that I need you 
 For coming to my room when you know Im alone 
 For finding me a highway and for driving me home 
 For that I serve you 
 For pulling me away when Im starting to fall 
 For revving me up when Im starting to stall 
 And all in all for that I want you 
 For taking and for giving and for playing the game 
 For praying for my future in the days that remain 
 Oh Lord for that I hold you 
 Ah but most of all 
 For that I love you 
 When youre crying out loud 
 You know I love youIts only two oclock and the temperatures beginning to soar 
 And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead 
 Its never been this hot and Ive never been so bored 
 And breathing is just no fun anymore 
 And then I saw you like a summer dream 
 And youre the answer to every prayer that I ever said 
 I saw you like a summer dream and 
 Youre the answer to every prayer that I ever said 
 You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse 
 The subways are sizzling and the skin of the street is gleaming with sweat 
 Ive seen you sitting on the steps outside 
 And you were looking so restless and wreckless and lost 
 I think its time for you to come inside 
 And Ill be waiting here with something that youll never forget 
 And Ill be waiting here with something that youll never forget 
 And therell be no turning back 
 You were only killing time and it will kill right back 
 Its time to burn up the fuse 
 Youve got nothing to do and even less to lose 
 So wander down the ancient hallway 
 Taking the stairs only one at a time 
 Follow the sound of my heartbeat now 
 Im in the room at the top 
 Youre at the end of the line 
 Open the door and lay down on the bed 
 The sun is just a ball of desire 
 And I wanna take you out of the frying pan and into the 
 Out of the frying pan and into the 
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire 
 And into the fire fire fire 
 Its only two oclock and the temperatures beginning to soar 
 And into the fire fire fireI aint livin here no more 
 I aint even keepin score 
 Its too late to change its over 
 Im drowned in a sea of tears 
 Nothin I can say to you 
 Makes any difference 
 There aint nothing I can do 
 None of it makin sense 
 Standing on the outside 
 Lookin in at you 
 Im running out of time 
 Im so tired of being alone 
 In a world that feels so cold 
 Theres got to be a light that I can find 
 Theres got to be a soul somewhere 
 That shines for me 
 Now I dont want to live without love any more 
 I just wanna live my life 
 Loves gonna open up the door 
 Show me its light again 
 What can I do 
 Yes Im lookin at youNot a dry eye in the house 
 After loves curtain comes down 
 Listen and youll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking 
 I can still see you standin there 
 Midnight wind blowin through your hair 
 Remember kisses sweet in the salty air 
 When love was forever 
 Turn the page and we fade to blue 
 The scene has changed now Im without you 
 Well you just walked away when the act was through 
 And the dream was over 
 It was almost like a movie 
 The way you said goodbye 
 You must have spent a lot of time 
 Rehearsing each and every line 
 Now theres not a dry eye in the house 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking breaking 
 Not a smile left on my face 
 The endings just too sad to take 
 And theres not a dry eye 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 The greatest story was you and me 
 We had it all we had everythinh 
 But now the storys done its just history 
 The last act is over 
 Your every line had the sweetest sound 
 Your every touch turned my world around 
 But then the light came up and my world crashed down 
 End of show its over 
 Those nights we touched the stars 
 Time stood still for you and I 
 Now its sad enough to make you cry 
 And theres not a dry eye in the house 
 Act One The storys just begun 
 Act Two I fell in love with you 
 Act Three Knew it was meant to be 
 Act Four You dont love me no more 
 The endings just to sad to take 
 And theres not a dry eye not a dry eye 
 Not a dry eye in the housePart One 
 At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming 
 The cars and the beast behind all start humming 
 And ooh youve got a cool machine so lets get it running 
 Well break the silence of the night 
 And you know theyre gonna hear us comin 
 We always see them whisper 
 We know theyre gonna talk 
 They fantasize the mysteries 
 Bout the night and the dark 
 So baby one more kiss baby one more kiss 
 We never have to say goodbye 
 Oh one more kiss baby one more kiss 
 It brings a little luck to the night 
 Artists got their easels 
 Theyre ready on the mark 
 Gonna try and take the pictures of 
 The dust and the gold in the sparks 
 And ooh you got a cool machine baby lets get it running 
 You never looked so good before 
 And your time its finally comin 
 Cause our home is the wind 
 Were the gods of the mornin 
 Champions of the night 
 When the engines are rumblin 
 Oh our home is the wind 
 So just one more kiss baby one more kiss 
 We never had to say goodbye 
 One more kiss baby one more kiss 
 I never wanna see you cry 
 One more kiss one more kiss

 Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie

 FadeIve been looking for an original sin 
 One with a twist and a bit of a spin 
 And since Ive done all the old ones 
 Till theyve all been done in 
 Now Im just looking  
 Then Im gone with the wind  
 Endlessly searching for an original sin 
 You can dance forever you got a fire in your feet 
 But will it ever be enough You know that itll never be enough 
 You can fly in never land and never need to sleep 
 Its not enough to make the nightmares go away 
 Its not enough to make the tears run dry 
 Its not enough to live a little better every day 
 Everything that they taught us was nothing but lies 
 Everything they they brought us was nothing but bribes 
 But itll all be over now 
 All I wanted was a piece of the night 
 I never got an equal share 
 When the stars are out of sight 
 And the moon is down  
 The natives are so restless tonight 
 Ive been looking for an original sin 
 You can lose yourself in pleasure till your bodys going numb 
 You can always take whatever you conceivably could want 
 Everything that they brought us was nothing but bribes 
 But the lies are over now 
 It never had to get so dark 
 For an original sin 
 Ive been looking for the ultimate crime 
 Infinite victims infinitesimal time  
 And Im so very guilty for no reason or rhyme 
 So now Im just looking 
 And Im killing some time  
 Endlessly searching for the ultimate crime 
 Then Im gone with the wind 
 Im applying for a license to thrill 
 Going out on the edge moving in for the kill 
 Theyll be hell to pay someday 
 So put it all on the bill 
 Cause well always be paying and paying until 
 Were beyond expiration with a license to thrill 
 Ive been looking for an origial sinOnce a beautiful Miss America married Mr Right 
 Had a little baby girl born on a stormy night 
 But that was once upon a time now its a brand new world 
 Gimme the future gimme the future 
 Gimme the future with a modern girl 
 Somewhere just between the past and somethin dawnin new 
 Theres a break in the chain a skip in the clock 
 Girl thats where Im gonna find you 
 Between the boy I was before and what Im gonna be 
 Theres a clash on the border a flame in the sky 
 Girl thats where you gonna find me 
 Cant ya hear the planet groanin like a broken down machine 
 Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens 
 But you and I stand innocent baby its a brand new world 
 Gimme the future gimme the future

 Under the crimson cutthroat canyon sky 
 Oh the citys on fire but the hills are alive with the sound of this night oh yeah 
 Baby leans close and she whispers she dont care 
 She wraps her legs round my waist runs her fingers through my hair 
 She rests her head on these soft tail lights 
 Feel the world rushing under this bike 
 Hear the cold highway explode in rubber and fire 
 Now the only thing that matters is this never cutting through this California wind 
 She said take me anywhere 
 She said take me everywhere 
 Everybodys got someone they dont wanna be 
 You dont wanna be you I dont wanna be me 
 Everybodys got a plan everybodys got a dream 
 I aint got nothing I just wanna be free 
 Aint much thats mine but these boots and this time 
 Maybe Ill take you right out of here 
 Baby Ill take you right out of here 
 Im a prize fight lover soul auctioneer 
 Now the 101 is blacker than a funeral parade 
 I grab the throttle left a scar on the interstate 
 You see the funny thing about leaving town 
 You leave something you think you cant live without 
 Now were heading north but shes looking south 
 She whispered one last request apologize to the desert wind 
 She said Ill never look back again 
 I got nothing I just wanna be free 
 I got you right here tucked behind my ear 
 Whisper all your fears and your dreams to me 
 I can feel you here I feel your scarred soul speak 
 With longing and nerving and its depth and its need 
 The night is alive this voice is a knife 
 Riding shotgun tonight on your contraband soul 
 I got a key premonition a wild proposition 
 Let the smoldering hunger in you explode 
 She ripped the knife from the scene with a fugitive scream and a gypsy prayer 
 Im a prize fight lover soul 
 Im a prize fight lover soul auctioneerThere were nights when the wind was so cold 
 That my body froze in bed 
 If I just listened to it right outside the window 
 There were days when the sun was so cruel 
 That all the tears turned to dust 
 And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever 
 I finished crying in the instant that you left 
 And I cant remember where or when or how 
 And I banished every memory you and I had ever made 
 But when you touch me like this Touch me like this 
 And you hold me like that Hold you like that 
 I just have to admit that its all coming back to me 
 When I touch you like this Touch you like this 
 And I hold you like that Hold you like that 
 Its so hard to believe but its all coming back to me now 
 Its all coming back 
 Its all coming back to me now 
 There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light 
 There were things Id never do again but then theyd always seemed right 
 There were nights of endless pleasure 
 It was more than any laws allow 
 Baby baby 
 If I kiss you like this Kiss you like this 
 And if you whisper like that Whisper like that 
 It was lost long ago but its all coming back to me 
 If you want me like this If you want me like this 
 And if you need me like that Need me like that 
 It was dead long ago but its all coming back to me 
 Its so hard to resist and its all coming back to me 
 I can barely recall but its all coming back to me now 
 Well come on come on 
 But you were history with the slamming of the door 
 And I made myself so strong again somehow 
 And I never wasted any of my time on you since then 
 But if I touch you like this Touch you like this 
 And if you kiss me like that Kiss me like that 
 It was so long ago but its all coming back to me 
 If you touch me like this Touch me like this 
 And if I kiss you like that Kiss you like that 
 It was gone with the wind but its all coming back to me now 
 There were things wed never do again but theyd always seemed right 
 It was more than all your laws allow 
 Baby baby baby 
 When you touch me like this Touch me like this 
 And when you hold me like that Hold me like that 
 It was gone with the wind but its all coming back to me 
 When you see me like this See me like this 
 And when I see you like that See you like that 
 Then we see what we want to see all coming back to me 
 The flesh and the fantasy all coming back to me 
 I can barely recall but its all coming back to me now come on 
 If you forgive me all this Forgive me all this 
 If I forgive you all that Forgive you all that 
 We forgive and forget and its all coming back to me now 
 When I touch you like that 
 And if you do it like this 
 And if weMadder than a mad man and bored to the core 
 Minute hand crawling cant take it anymore 
 Futures up the highway ya gotta get away 
 Gonna take a little trip and find a Tijuana stray 
 Got the time to take it 
 Got the balls to break it 
 Gotta car thatll make it 
 South of the border dont drink the water 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Crazy from the heat and runnin for the red light 
 Oh Senorita have two tequila 
 Heat seeker Lord the will is gettin weaker 
 Burnin with the fever and runnin for the red light 
 She aint a teacher she aint a preacher 
 Just so close to holy that youre runnin just to reach her 
 Time bomb is tickin my heads about to bust 
 Need your personal attention or I swear Im gonna rust 
 Find a little place no one will tell you what to do 
 Tell her Im a rebel she says Yea without a clue 
 Just need some understanding a girl who aint demanding 
 Who aint afraid to fake it south of the border 
 Dont drink the water 
 Oh Senorita have three tequila 
 Love seeker Lord the will is gettin weaker 
 Just so close to holy that you gotta run to reach her 
 Need some understanding a girl who aint demanding 
 A little bad behavior shes gonna be my savior 
 My knees are shakin my back is breakin 
 Oh Mama Mia a Senorita 
 Oh Senorita have some tequila 
 Need sneakers Lord the will is gettin weaker 
 Just heard the bell that got me outta hell 
 Got a girl I gotta life Shouldve listened when you said Id miss you 
 Shouldve listened but I could not hear 
 You said Id want you back 
 I said not a chance 
 Now I can see I was so blind 
 Youre right I was wrong 
 To ever leave you 
 I made a mistake 
 Im sorry now 
 To ever let you go 
 Now I know now I know 
 Couldnt see it when I had you with me 
 Couldnt see that I had everything 
 And now I see it clear 
 And now you are not here 
 You said someday Id change my mind 
 If I could have one more chance to hold you 
 I would keep you here in my arms 
 And never let you got 
 Because now I know 
 Youre right I was wrongYo baby 
 I wrote you this poem 
 Id like to dedicate it to ya 
 Im just a white boy 
 I play the guitar 
 I put my pants on 
 I drive a shit car 
 Up into the valley 
 To see my girlfriend 
 She got a big couch 
 She got a mercedes benz 
 Sing halleluiah 
 My glass is half full 
 She pours me champagne 
 She drinks a red bull 
 Ans she says darling 
 One thing you got to understand 
 As long as I am satisfied 
 Well you will always be my man 
 You know that I 
 Ill give you all the love that I have 
 Ill empty all my pockets

 Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans 
 Way back up on the woods among the evergreens 
 There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood 
 Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode 
 Whod never ever learned to read or write so well 
 But he could play a guitar just like aringin a bell 
 Go Go 
 Go Johnny Go Go 
 Ooh Johnny B Goode 
 He used to carry his guitar in a gurny sack 
 Sit beneath the tree by the railroad track 
 Fiddlin to the music that the drivers played 
 Sittin there playin all alone in the shade 
 Many people passing from miles around 
 Boy that country boy could really fool around

 Jailhouse Rock 
 The warden threw a party in the county jail 
 The prison band was there and they began to wail 
 The band was jumpin and the joint began to swing 
 You shouldve heard those knocked out jailbirds sing 
 Lets rock everybody lets rock 
 Everybody in the whole cellblock 
 Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock

 Johnny B Goode reprise

 And you will be the leader of a big old band

 And you said nothing at all 
 Well I couldnt have said it better myself 
 Tonight the conversation takes the fall 
 Just love me like you love nobody else 
 Little lady 
 I think theres something on your mind 
 Ive known you long enough to know 
 The words are not that hard to find 
 And the harder you try 
 And the longer you go 
 Well theres nothing but love 
 In those eyes anymore 
 You know what to say 
 But you never know how 
 You can keep your mouth shut 
 Because it doesnt really 
 Matter right now 
 I will guide you all the way 
 Because I know exactly 
 What youre trying to say 
 You have the right 
 To remain silent 
 Ill get the lights 
 You get that smile 
 And you say nothing at all 
 I see the angels 
 Theyre standing right outside your door 
 GIRL 
 Theyre watching over me 
 Theyre watching over us all 
 BOY 
 You can send them home tonight 
 Because you wont need them anymore 
 In your arms 
 I think Ive found 
 The safest place to fall 
 BOTH 
 When I step in the door and I stare at your face 
 There are so many things that I wish I could say 
 Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight 
 Because it doesnt really matter tonight 
 I will guide you 
 All the way tonight 
 BOY 
 And I know you feel the same 
 Youve been searching for the words 
 Now you know what to say 
 Just say nothing 
 Dont say a word 
 Silence is gold 
 Shhh 
 Instrumental bridge 
 This is the moment weve been waiting for oh yeah 
 If I exercise my right 
 I will take your body language 
 And hold it against you tonight 
 Ive wondered all my life 
 If this moment comes 
 Would I know what to say 
 Boy and girl girl in  
 Then you say nothing at all 
 So many times I stumbled on the words that I wanted to say 
 You said nothing at all 
 So many thoughts that I should have just let my heart explain 
 So many ways we could turn the words around 
 So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground 
 So many dreams that are finally coming true 
 Well I couldnt have said it better myself 
 Now you finish me off when 
 You finish my thoughts the way you do 
 Chorus outThe locusts are singing 
 The sun is red 
 Its gotten so late somehow 
 Theres gonna be trouble 
 You know what they said 
 We should have been home by now 
 The thunder is rolling 
 The sky is black 
 Its gotten so dark somehow 
 Theres gonna be danger 
 God I wish we were back 
 No matter what they tell us 
 No matter what they do 
 No matter what they teach us 
 What we believe is true 
 No matter what they call us 
 However they attack 
 No matter where they take us 
 Well find our own way back 
 I cant deny what I believe 
 I cant be what Im not 
 I know Ill love forever 
 I know no matter what 
 If only tears were laughter 
 If only night was day 
 If only prayers were answered 
 Then we would hear God say 
 No matter what they tell you 
 No matter what they teach you 
 What you believe is true 
 And I will keep you safe and strong 
 And sheltered from the storm 
 No matter where its barren 
 A dream is being born 
 No matter who they follow 
 No matter where they lead 
 No matter how they judge us 
 Ill be everyone you need 
 No matter if the sun dont shine 
 Or if the skies are blue 
 No matter what the ending 
 My life began with you 
 I know this loves forever 
 I cant deny what I believe 
 I cant be what Im not 
 Thats all that matters now no matter what 
 We should have been home by nowWe search for an answer 
 And when it appears 
 We can challenge the world 
 With our sweat and our tears 
 Through winning and losing 
 Oh the brave never bend 
 And the hero keeps fighting 
 Standing tall in the end 
 And time can do anything 
 It can mend any fall 
 Its the moment of truth thats facing us all 
 And its time for the hero to stand tall 
 Its a time for heroes 
 Time to answer the call 
 Its a time for heroes oh in us all 
 We carry the flame 
 For all to see 
 And the fire and the passion 
 Of what we can be 
 And sometimes we must fight 
 Oh but we will never  never  bend 
 Standing tall in the end 
 And love can change anything 
 Its inside of us all 
 To reach out a hand 
 Oh whenever we fall 
 Its time for the hero to stand tall 
 Its a time for heroes to stand tall 
 When our backs to the wall 
 In us all 
 Its a time for heroes its a time for heroes 
 Deep inside of our soul deep inside of our soul 
 Its a time for heroes 
 Time to answer the call 
 And when our backs to the wall 
  
 Background vocals keep repeating the following line 
  
 Its a time for heroesEverytime I hear your name you know 
 I wonder why you wanted to go 
 I said no you couldnt come along for the ride 
 I said hey I want outta here and nobody taggin behind 
 Dontcha know I love you so I told you a lie 
 I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 A family life and a lovin wife just aint my kinda scene 
 Well when Im all alone when the nights are cold 
 I get to thinkin I was kinda mean 
 We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try 
 You know I told you a lie 
 Ah ah ah ah ah 
 Ut ah ah ah ah 
 You know I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 Dontcha know I love you so I 
 Dontcha know I love you so I told you 
 Dontcha know I love you so I told you a lie 
 Love you so I told you a lie 
 I loved you so I told you a lie 
 Loved you so loved you so 
 Ah 
 Loved you so I told you a lie 
 Loved you so I told you a lieAnd I would do anything for love 
 Id run right into hell and back 
 I would do anything for love 
 Ill never lie to you and thats a fact 
 But Ill never forget the way 
 You feel right now oh no no way 
 And I would do anything for love 
 But I wont do that 
 No I wont do that 
 Anything for love 
 Oh I would do anything for love 
 But I wont do that ah 
 And some days it dont come easy 
 And some days it dont come hard 
 Some days it dont come at all 
 And these are the days that never end 
 And some nights youre breathing fire 
 And some nights youre carved in ice 
 Some nights youre like nothing 
 Ive ever seen before or will again 
 And maybe Im crazy 
 Oh its crazy and its true 
 I know you can save me 
 No one else can save me now but you 
 As long as the planets are turning 
 As long as the stars are burning 
 As long as your dreams are coming true 
 You better believe it 
 That I would do anything for love 
 And Ill be there till the final act 
 And Ill take the vow and seal a pact 
 But Ill never forgive myself 
 If we dont go all the way tonight 
 Anything youve been dreaming of 
 But I just wont do that 
 And some days I pray for silence 
 And some days I pray for soul 
 Some days I just pray to the God of 
 Sex and drums and rock n roll 
 And some nights I lose the feeling 
 And some nights I lose control 
 Some nights I just lose it all 
 When Im watching you dance and the thunder rolls 
 And maybe Im lonely 
 Thats all Im qualified to be 
 Theres just one and only 
 One and only promise I can keep 
 As long as the wheels are turning 
 As long as the fires are burning 
 As long as your prayers are coming true 
 And you know its true and thats a fact 
 And therell never be no turning back 
 But Ill never do it better than I do it with you 
 So long so long 
 No no no I wont do 
 But Ill never stop dreaming of you 
 Every night of my life no way 
 Will you raise me up Will you help me down 
 Will you get me right out of this god forsaken town 
 Will you make it all a little less cold 
 I can do that 
 Oh I can do that 
 Will you hold me sacred Will you hold me tight 
 Can you colorize my life Im so sick of black and white 
 Can you make it all a little less old 
 Oh woah now I can do that 
 Will you make me some magic with your own two hands 
 Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand 
 Can you give me something I can take home 
 Now I can do that 
 Will you cater to every fantasy Ive got 
 Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot ha 
 Will you take me places Ive never known 
 After awhile youll forget everything 
 It was a brief interlude and a midsummer nights fling 
 And youll see that its time to move on 
 I wont do that 
 I know the territory Ive been around 
 Itll all turn to dust and well all fall down 
 Sooner or later youll be screwing around 
 No I wont do thatBoy 
 I never knew so many bad times 
 Could follow me so mercilessly 
 Its so surreal all the pain that I feel 
 The future aint what it used to be 
 It doesnt matter what theyre thinking 
 It doesnt matter what theyre thinking of me 
 Its always so cold and Im too young to be old 
 Were there ever any stars in the sky 
 And did the sun ever shine so bright 
 Do you have any dreams I can borrow 
 Just to get me through the lonely nights 
 Is there anything left to hold on to 
 When the rivers wash it all away 
 Is there anyone left to hold on to 
 Is there anything left I can say 
 Say a prayer for the fallen angels 
 Stem the tide of the rising waters 
 Toll a bell for the broken hearted 
 Burn a torch for your sons and daughters 
 The endless night has got a hold of me 
 Dark days are pulling me forward 
 And all these years are washing over me 
 And Im crying  Im lost forever 
 In a future that aint what it used to be 
 A future that aint what it used to be 
 A future that aint what it used to be no more 
 No more no more no more 
 Girl 
 Its like a storm thats never ending 
 Its like a shadow on the land and the sea 
 Theres nothing as sad as a tomorrow gone bad 
 The future aint what it used to be come on 
 Boy 
 Some days I feel so numb and empty 
 And those would be the good days for me 
 Both 
 Nothing gets to me now unless Im thinking of how 
 A future that aint what it used to be no more 
 Girl No more no more no more no more 
 Boy No more 
 Girl No more no more no more come on 
 Boy No more no more no more come on 
 The future just aint what it used to be 
 Oh the future just aint what it used to be 
 Girl The future that aint what it used to be no more 
 Hmmm the future just aint what it used to be 
 Girl Ah the future the future the future the future 
 Oh the future the future the future just aint what it used to be 
 The future just aint what it used to be 
 Oh future just aint what it used to be 
 Ah the future just aint what it used to be 
 Girl The future 
 I wish it wouldnt come 
 I wish it wouldnt come but it always doesIf God could talk 
 Would He tell you to come back to me 
 If God could talk 
 Would He tell you its all right just leave 
 And dont look back at all the memories 
 The best of times the mess you made of me 
 Walk on if you think its gonna make you strong 
 Why dont you run away 
 And find yourself alive 
 Go on and turn the page 
 Before your lonely world collides 
 Whats it gonna take to break the silence 
 Thats been tearin you apart 
 Would He part the oceans straight to you 
 Make mountains move crumble at your feet to get you through 
 Another day another night alone 
 Stepping out into the great unknown tonight 
 Even God knows baby that aint right 
 If only God could talk 
 Did you swear to yourself 
 On the day it was over 
 That youd never turn around 
 And get locked up in another cage 
 Did you tear all the pictures 
 Of us living life together 
 Did you burn all the memries 
 That have been made in a fit of rage 
 Thats been tearin you apart 
 Ooh would you listen now if God could talkTouch me 
 Im so afraid to draw you close 
 Hold me 
 Before my hands fall away 
 Ill suffocate 
 If I cant breathe you in 
 And hold you there 
 Forever 
 I left a message at the hotel 
 They said you checked out 
 They said you aint coming back 
 I tried to call you 
 But you turned off your cell 
 And it said at the tone 
 Just leave me alone 
 And I fall apart at the seams 
 It seems that I always always fall apart 
 But as strong as I am 
 Why cant I break your heart 
 I remember how it used to be 
 Making love to you all night long 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 And hold you there until all my strength was gone 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I built this prison that I thought was a home 
 And we both lived here 
 Guess you were living alone 
 Id tear it down if you would only have asked 
 And I would build you a bridge 
 So you could come back 
 And hold you there until all your fears were gone 
 Girl Hey now tell me why cant you just break my heart 
 And I used to take you in my arms 
 Girl I loved you from the start 
 Now you cant tear my world apart 
 Now every bit of faith is gone 
 Girl You used to be so strong 
 Now you cant even break my heart 
 Whats it going to take for us to break down 
 And finally fall 
 Apart at the seams 
 It seems that I always will fall apart 
 Girl As strong as you are  
 As strong as I am  
 Girl Why cant you break my heartTalkin about rock n roll mercenaries 
 Soilders of fortune by some other name 
 Im talking about rock n roll mercenaries 
 Money is power and power is fame 
 Everything you pay to hear 
 Just listen 
 Everything to catch your ear 
 Whatever it takes theyre ready to sell 
 Anything and everything they do it themselves 
 Talkin about rock n roll mercenaries 
 Young are the victims so easily swayed 
 As some given are poisoned so continuous placed 
 Our conscience is a load so heavy to carry 
 For a rock n roll mercenary 
 It starts with a game 
 See how they play 
 Till all of the laughter is faded away 
 Ooh its not for the soul 
 Its not for the love 
 Its just for the gold 
 And its never enough 
 Rock n roll mercenaries 
 Ooh talkin aboutIve been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say 
 I thought Id leave you with a letter of firey speech 
 Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play 
 And Ive been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense 
 Id like to know how you faded and you threw it away 
 Id like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant 
 Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around 
 With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks 
 We started out with a bang and at the top of the world 
 Now all the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks 
 And everythings blank 
 If I could only find the words then I would write it all down 
 If I could only find a voice I would speak 
 Oh its there in my eyes so cant you see me tonight 
 Cmon and look at me and read em and weep 
 Ive been whispering softly 
 Trying to build a cry up into a scream 
 We let the past slip away 
 And put the future on hold 
 Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream 
 With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks 
 But now the rooms are all empty and the candles are dark 
 The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks 
 If I could find the words then I would write it all down 
 Oh its there in my eyes so cant you see me tonight 
 Cmon will you look at me 
 And read em and weep 
 Its there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart 
 Its running silent and angry and deep 
 Its here in my eyes and its all I can say 
 Read em and weep 
 For all the hours well be spending alone 
 For the dreams well ignore 
 Running silent and deep 
 And all those promises we promised to keep 
 They wont be kept anymore 
 For the magic that our bodies had made 
 For the blood that weve lost 
 And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed 
 For whatever the cost 
 For the memories still alive in the bed 
 For the lies we believed 
 And all the things that can never be said 
 Why dont you look at me and read em and weep 
 Its there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart 
 Its running silent and angry and deep 
 Its there in my eyes its all I can say 
 Cmon and look at me and read em and weepI didnt take a suitcase 
 I had to travel light 
 I climbed out my bedroom window 
 It was just about quarter past midnight 
 Out on the highway 
 I hitched a ride 
 I was heading west 
 I had to listen to some trucker 
 Tell me all about the meaning of life 
 Got a ride just outside of Memphis 
 I was wild out on the road 
 I saw shanties and shacks 
 And burned out Cadillacs 
 And faces that glittered like gold 
 Shoulda seen it coming 
 Shoulda seen the signs 
 I saw seven horses running 
 I had a front row seat at the end of time 
 I was just fifteen 
 And the world was mine 
 And I watched my dreams 
 Come to life on that night 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 Now since that long lost summer 
 I aint ever looked back 
 Now the lines on my face 
 Are looking more like cracks 
 When the dreams all crumble 
 Its time to face the facts 
 I dont care about tomorrow 
 Oh theres no looking back 
 I shoulda seen it coming 
 Oh I shoulda seen the signs 
 I was standing tall 
 Thought I would never die 
 And I watched it all 
 In the white spot light 
 When the lights went out 
 I heard the young girls scream 
 The sound of my heart beat 
 My heart beat 
 Would make the thunder proud 
 Well I was just fifteen 
 The wolrd was mine 
 Well I was standing tall 
 I would never die 
 Oh I saw Elvis in VegasWhere have all good men gone and where are all the gods 
 Wheres the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds 
 Isnt there a white knight upon a fiery steed 
 Late at night I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need 
 I need a hero 
 Im holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
 Hes gotta be strong and hes gotta be fast 
 And hes gotta be fresh from the fight 
 Im holding out for a hero till the morning light 
 Hes gotta be sure and its gotta be soon 
 And hes gotta be larger than life larger than life 
 Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy 
 Somewhere just beyond my reach theres someone reaching back for me 
 Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat 
 Its gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet 
 And hes gotta be larger than life 
 Up where the mountains meet the heavens above 
 Out where the lightning splits the sea 
 I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me 
 Through the wind and the chill and the rain 
 And the storm and the flood 
 I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood 
 Im holding out for a hero till the end of the nightHit it 
 Everything Ive ever dreamed of 
 Has begun to fade to black 
 Oh I dont know where I ever lost love 
 Or where to go now to get it back 
 Im a desperate lonely child and I dont have enough 
 Ive come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love 
 If it aint real  fake it 
 If it aint yours  take it 
 If it dont exist  you make it 
 If it aint broke  break it 
 If its gone to sleep  you wake it 
 Gimme some words I can live by 
 Gimme commandments to know 
 Gimme some fables and proverbs 
 You gotta gimme some signs where to go 
 There are designated angels who just might save your soul no 
 They give me words to live by  and thats all that I know 
 If its all gone bad  forsake it 
 If it aint broke  break it 
 There are designated angels who just might save your soul 
 And if it aint broke  break itI dont know I can do this 
 What am I supposed to say 
 You have been my dream for so long 
 Now that dream is slipping away 
 I dont want to let you go 
 Its only that I know I must 
 I cant hardly get the words out 
 Baby is this the end of us 
 You know that I want You 
 You know that I need you baby 
 You know that I love you 
 So why isnt that enough 
 Iv been sleeping in the daytime 
 Ive been weeping at the scene 
 Wishing you would haunt me 
 And you would tell me this was all a dream 
 Wishing you were here beside me 
 What I would give to hold you tight 
 But nothing I can do or say 
 Will change the truth tonight 
 If I want you 
 And I need you 
 And I love you 
 And I want that to be enough 
 Because I want you 
 Yes I want you 
 I can hardly get the words out 
 Baby is this the end of us 
 Why isnt that enough 
 I wish it was enoughThe sirens are screaming and the fires were howling 
 Way down in the valley tonight 
 Theres a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
 And a blade shining oh so bright 
 Theres evil in the air and theres thunder in the sky 
 And a killers on the bloodshot streets 
 Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising 
 Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter 
 He was starting to foam in the heat 
 Oh baby youre the only thing in this whole world 
 Thats pure and good and right 
 And wherever you are and wherever you go 
 Theres always gonna be some light 
 But I gotta get out I gotta break it out now 
 Before the final crack of dawn 
 So we gotta make the most of our one night together 
 When its over you know well both be so alone 
 Well like a bat out of hell 
 Ill be gone when the morning comes 
 When the night is over 
 Like a bat out of hell Ill be gone gone gone 
 Like a bat out of hell Ill be gone when the morning comes 
 When the day is done and the sun goes down 
 And the moonlights shining through 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 Ill come crawling on back to you 
 Im gonna hit the highway like a battering ram 
 Im on a silver black phantom bike 
 When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry 
 And were all about to see the light 
 Nothing ever grows in this rotten old hole 
 And everything is stunted and lost 
 And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls 
 And nothings ever worth the cost 
 And I know that Im damned if I never get out 
 And maybe Im damned if I do 
 But with any other beat I got left in my heart 
 You know Id rather be damned with you 
 If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night with you 
 Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night dancing through the night 
 But when the day is done and the sun goes down 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
 See myself tearing up the road 
 Faster than any other boy has ever gone 
 Well and my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 
 And no ones gonna stop me now Im gonna make my escape 
 But I cant stop thinking of you 
 And I never see the sudden curve until its way too late no 
 And I never see the sudden curve until its way too late 
 Then Im dying on the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
 And the last thing I see is my heart still beating 
 Breaking out of my body flying away like a bat out of hell 
 Dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Im torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And the last thing I see is my heart still beating still beating 
 Well like a bat out of hell like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hellYou see me now as large as life 
 But underneath you knew all too well 
 The hollow shell no spark of life 
 Where once upon a time there beat a heart for you 
 And you knew it from the start 
 But you went and blew it all away 
 And you knew how yeah you knew best 
 The strings to pull and the buttons to press 
 To wind me up and make me shake 
 You controlling every move I make 
 I couldnt see through it 
 All the pain 
 And you put me through it 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over  
 How could you say there was no other 
 Why is it nothings what it seems 
 You told me Im your greatest lover 
 Do you even know what that word means 
 You lovin is coolin 
 Baby who dya think youre foolin 
 Cause when I woke up 
 I caught you cheatin in your dreams 
 Stop it stop it 
 Dont you say a word 
 I felt my hands around her neck 
 And everything went blurred 
 Broken broken 
 She slipped from out my hands 
 She lay so still and lifeless 
 I cried baby baby baby  
 Your lovin is coolin 
 Baby who dya hink youre foolin 
 Cheatin cheatin 
 Cheatin in your dreams 
 It was my dumb luck 
 I just came unstuck 
 When my whole world shook 
 Id had about enough 
 I caught you cheatin in your dreamsDid you ever love somebody 
 So much that the earth moved 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Even though it hurt to 
 Nothin else your heart could do 
 Who never knew 
 Did you ever lay your head down 
 On the shoulder of a good friend 
 And then had to look away somehow 
 Had to hide the way you felt for them 
 Have you ever prayed the day would come 
 Youd hear them say theyd feel it too 
 Have you ever loved somebody 
 And if 
 You did 
 Well you know Id understand 
 I could 
 I would 
 More than anybody can 
 Like I love you 
 Like I love youMeat Loaf 
 Sometimes its the night 
 And the way it seems to cry 
 And whisper terrifying secrets in your ear 
 Sometimes its the day 
 And the sun has got no mercy 
 Lighting up and burning everything thats in its way 
 There are times Ive gotta run 
 Times Ive gotta hide 
 Things Ive left undone 
 Things Ive cast aside 
 So many things to try 
 So many things denied 
 If I ever tell you the truth 
 Id swear you would leave me 
 I need the proof 
 That you would believe me

 But the storms are never so very far 
 Karla and Ellen 
 And you think my life is shining like a star 
 But the fears are never very far 
 And  
 All 
 We always seem so much braver than we ever are 
 We always dream we seem braver but we never are 
 Lets run away 
 Lets go so far  
 II 
 Meat Loaf 
 There are secrets I never can tell 
 There are shadows of darkness and heaven 
 There are so many suburbs of hell 
 And their hours are 247 
 There are so many wounds you cant heal 
 So many nightmares are turning too real 
 So much of paradise lost and you added the cost 
 But theres nothing to be sorry for 
 Now we can feel so much more 
 Now we can be loving you 
 Nothing that were scared to do 
 Ellen 
 You see me smile and you swear that I could walk on air 
 You see me dancing the moonlight glancing at my hair 
 You see me as powerfully strong 
 But the nightmares never so very far 
 Karla 
 But the tears are never very far 
 The fears are never very far 
 We always seem to be braver but we never are 
 Karla and Ellen Lets fly away 
 Lets go too far  
 III 
 Sometimes its the flesh 
 And the way it seems to yearn 
 For all the magic of the single perfect touch 
 Sometimes its the soul 
 And its waiting for salvation 
 Youll know when you get it 
 There can never be too much 
 Would you ever believe me 
 Show me the proof 
 Im so scared you would leave me 
 You think I fly like an angel without any care 
 Higher and higher as if Im breathing sacred air 
 Meat Loaf and Karla 
 Or the nightmares never very far

 Say a prayer for those who crawl 
 Say a prayer for those who run 
 Say a prayer so all and all 
 Theres a better life to come 
 We always seem so much braver than we ever are  
 Say a prayer for those alone 
 Say a prayer for those apart 
 All the golden boys and girls 
 The crusaders of the heart 
 We always dream wed be braver but we never are  
 Say a prayer for all the lost 
 Say a prayer for the unborn 
 Say a prayer for all the young 
 It takes a fire to keep them warm 
 Say a prayer for those obsessed 
 Say a prayer for those enslaved 
 Say a prayer to beat the drums 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen 
 Say a prayer for all the saints 
 Say a prayer for all the sins 
 Let the dancing never end 
 Let the future now begin 
 Say a prayer to all the gods 
 Some are near and some are far 
 To make us braver than we are 
 V 
 How far is too far baby 
 Come on and take me take me 
 Were crusaders of the heart 
 And going all the way is just the start 
 How far is too far 
 How far is too far baby 
 Take me deep inside the heart 
 Say a prayer 
 Going all the way is just the start 
 Make us braver than we are 
 Theres no such thing as too far 
 Ive got to be where you are 
 VI 
 To make us braver than we are Phonecall 
 This is one of the neighbors from down the street 
 This racket of this music has been goin on all afternoon 
 And Im sick and tired of it If it doesnt stop Im calling the police 
 You got me on the run you got it your way 
 Now Im feeling pretty good and Im beginning to sweat 
 Your love is so fine its got me feelin all right 
 Going out of my mind I got to have you tonight 
 The girls so deep inside like blood in my veins 
 Never lets me hide now Im going insane 
 It makes me climb the walls bite my nails to the bone 
 Its always by my side it never leaves me alone 
 When its time to get tough Im masculine masculine masculine 
 When she wants to play rough Im masculine masculine masculine 
 Masculine 
 I know that Im a man from the spark in my soul 
 It can make me so hot you got out of control 
 Grab her by the hair drag her back to your cave 
 Its what makes a man a man people always stay the same 
 Im masculine 
 Masculine masculine repeats 
 In the heat of the night 
 And in the dark of the day 
 Anytime anyplace anyway 
 When she wants to make love Im masculine masculine masculine 
 If you push me Ill shove Im masculine 
 When she wants to play rough Im masculine 
 When she wants to make love Im masculine to fadeYou cant run away forever 
 But theres nothing wrong with getting a good head start 
 You want to shut out the night you want to shut down the sun 
 You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart 
 Think of how wed lay down together 
 Wed be listening to the radio so loud and so strong 
 Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods 
 Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs 
 I treasure your love 
 I never want to lose it 
 Youve been through the fires of hell 
 And I know youve got the ashes to prove it 
 I want to show you how to use it 
 Youve been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
 And I know youve got the scars to prove it 
 Remember everything that I told you 
 And Im telling you again that its true 
 When youre alone and afraid and youre completly amazed 
 To find theres nothing anybody can do 
 Keep on believing and youll discover baby 
 Theres always something magic 
 Theres always something new 
 And when you really really need it the most 
 Thats when rock and roll dreams come through 
 The beat is yours forever 
 the beat is yours forever 
 The beat is always true 
 true 
 And when you really really need it the most 
 Thats when rock and roll dreams come through for you 
 Once upon a time was a backbeat 
 Once upon a time all the chords came to life 
 And the angels had guitars even before thay had wings 
 If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night 
 Get you through the night 
 treasure your love 
 Youre never alone cause you can put on the phones 
 And let the drummer tell your heart what to do 
 theres always something magic 
 new 
 Oh for you yeah 
 The beat is yours forever 
 Thats when rock and roll dreams come through 
 Thats when rock and roll dreams come throughWaiter said this tables set for three 
 Well thats too bad cause no ones joining me 
 Maybe I prefer to dine alone 
 What you dont understand about a party of one 
 I used to keep a lot of people around 
 Who had their hands over my eyes ears and mouth 
 Just like the money and the buzz they were gone in the morning 
 Now Im a party of one 
 Want to get away on a holiday 
 So I packed my bags and I flew away 
 Im in the air and Im so turned on 
 Honey cant you see Im a party of one 
 These days I wake up and theres no one in sight 
 Sometimes it gets so lonely I dont mind 
 I live alone but at least my roommate knows me 
 Im a party of one 
 Dont get to comfortable cause you gotta go 
 You have some nerve showing up here oh 
 Oh talk to the hand 
 Talk to me on my level 
 Im a party 
 Help me no 
 Help me out of this box 
 Get me out of here 
 Im a party of oneAll the leaves are brown and the sky is gray 
 I went for a walk on a winters day 
 Id be safe and warm if I was in LA 
 California dreamin on such a winters day 
 Stopped in to a church I passed along the way 
 Well I got down on my knees got down on my knees 
 And I began to pray I began to pray 
 You know the preacher likes the cold preacher likes the cold 
 He knows that Im gonna stay knows Im gonna stay 
 Oh now California dreamin 
 California dreamin On such a winters day oh yeah 
 All the leaves are brown all the leaves are brown 
 And the sky is gray and the sky is gray 
 I went for a walk I went for a walk 
 On a winters day on a winters day 
 If I didnt tell her I could leave today 
 Oh now California dreamin I thought you went away

 California thought the sky was grey

 And the sky is gray 
 And the skies are grayInto each life a little sunlight wants to shine 
 Let me tell your fortune life that once was mine 
 She was a special girl and she meant the world to me 
 And I gave her everything 
 When I found her Id been looking everywhere 
 And when I lost her I was lost beyond despair 
 Dreams are hard to touch could it be I love her too much 
 Bottom line is she was fine in every way 
 And its not with hesitation that I say 
 Dreams they come and go but thoughts 
 Like love will always growTu eres cruel monstro 
 No eres fiel monstro 
 Hijo del mal monstro 
 Un ser fatal monstro 
 Tu corazon monstro 
 Es un ladron monstroSome people get by 
 With a little understanding 
 Some people get by 
 With a whole lot more 
 I dont know 
 Why you gotta be so undemanding 
 One thing I know 
 Is I want more 
 More more more  
 I want more 
 And I need all the love I can get 
 And I need all the love that I cant get too 
 Whyd you get sad 
 To feel so much 
 To let somebody touch you 
 So hot so cold 
 So far so out of control 
 Hard to come by 
 But not all 
 And some people get by 
 There are parts of me that dont get nervous 
 Not the parts that shake 
 You wont get what you deserve 
 You are what you take 
 Broken hearts are the Devils playground 
 Im not done yet 
 Counterfeit lovers 
 Or a virtual orgy 
 Anything I can get 
 I want more  
 I want more Some say its wrong some say its right 
 Its gonna rain 
 Yeah 
 Its gonna rain rain rain rain yeah 
 Its gonna rainHey Ricky now mine is empty 
 How about one for you 
 We could set it out together 
 Seems tomorrows overdue 
 Captain Video done went home 
 One pilot laid to rest 
 And dragon ladies talk that talk 
 About who loves who who loves best 
 Silver bullets in the jukebox 
 Spin another round 
 Everybody at the back of the line 
 Its midnight at the lost and found 
 Midnight at the lost and found 
 Lost souls in the hunting ground 
 A remedy for all your ills 
 At the lost and found 
 Midnight 
 Have a double its gettin late 
 Youll get home home just rely on fate 
 Place just finally came alive 
 Good old boys just arrived 
 Stools keep changin faces 
 And the night just slips away 
 And like a long distance love affair 
 Soon youve got to pay 
 Hangin on barely hitch a ride away 
 Belly up and bury boy all the hurt you feel today 
 Everybody get back in line 
 Last call for the lost and found

 This town splits right down the middle 
 Theres rich and poor black and white 
 Right down through the saints and the sinners 
 And the ones who might 
 This world is tough as a splinter 
 Theres ones that flinch and ones that fight 
 Round here you can sure tell the difference 
 Tween the rocks and the rolling types 
 I know Im gonna stick with ya 
 When the hard times hit 
 Somebodys gotta stand in the storm 
 In the lightning when it pours 
 Be strong enough to lean on 
 Show you what a backbones for 
 Somebodys gotta stand 
 John Rich with Mark McGrath 
 Well nobody likes a white flag quitter 
 Leaves you there tucks and runs 
 Lifes comin and it hits like a hammer 
 Kicks like a shotgun 
 I aint out here looking for trouble 
 Im no stranger to an uphill fight 
 You need a hand when it all starts slipping 
 You can bet Ima hold on tight 
 Well you know Im gonna stick with ya

 Me and my crew we keep it Trumptight 
 Live yours boythis is my life

 As I stomp through the rain 
 The pain rushes through my vein 
 But I still maintain 
 Nah

 Insane like Busey 
 Now who wants test weee 
 Now see Im the best at it 
 You just like the rest at it

 Meat Loaf Lil Jon adlibs 
 Somebody gotta 
 Somebody gotta yeah 
 Somebodys gotta stand in the stormWho needs the young 
 The revelation of their faces and their hair 
 When all we have are withered traces of the faces we once were 
 And suffocation in the dirty fatal air 
 Who needs the young bodies floating in the sun 
 Who needs the young 
 The celebration of the races that theyve have won 
 The sado masochistic things theyve never done  disgusting 
 And all the places that we never will have gone 
 My eyes just arent what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can see Blind him 
 My lips just arent what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can kiss Spit on him 
 My mind just isnt what it was 
 Is there anyone left who can dream Wake him 
 My legs just arent what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can dance Cripple him 
 My voice just isnt what it was 
 Is there anyone left who can sing Silence him 
 My sex just isnt what is was 
 Is there anyone left who can fuck Screw them  
 The perfect star of flesh that never has to cry 
 Who needs the filthy moaning passed from thigh to thigh 
 Who needs the selfappointed prophets waving banners in the bloodshot sky 
 Who needs the young when were spending all the rest of our wonderful lives learning to die Everyday of my life they say the same old thing 
 Hey boy  oh boy  you better wait your turn 
 And everyday of my life I get the same old line 
 Hey boy  oh boy  when are you going to learn 
 I wanna go on the red I wanna I wanna go on the green 
 I wanna go on all colors that I see in between 
 I wanna run all the tolls I wanna I wanna run all the signs 
 I wanna run all the way across a double white line 
 But everyday of my life I see the same old road 
 Hey girl  oh girl  we gotta pull up our routes 
 And everyday of my life I see the same old dream 
 Hey girl  oh girl  I need a dream I can use 
 I wanna go on the red  I wanna go on the green 
 I wanna go I wanna 
 I wanna run all the tolls  I wanna run all the signs 
 I wanna run I wanna run all the signs 
 My body is the car and my soul is the ignition 
 Your love will be the key and well jockey for position till we 
 Peel out Peel out Peel out 
 Were sick and tired of waiting in line 
 Nobodys taking our time 
 Thats all were leaving behind 
 There oughta be a law and there better be a crime 
 And every night of my life theres something holding me back 
 Hey girl  What is it boy Oh girl I know its time to cut loose 
 And every night of my life I dream of someone like you 
 Hey girl  What is it boy  Oh girl you got a dream I can use 
 Peel out Peel out Peel out Peel out Peel out 
 Peel outWhy dont we do it in the road 
 Why dont we do it in the road 
 No one will be watching us 
 Why dont we do it do it in the road 
 Well now no one will be watching us 
 Oh yeahI dont want to let another minute get by 
 Theyre slipping through our fingers but were ready to fly 
 The nightll be our cover and well huddle below 
 We got the music in our bodies and the radio 
 And when the morning arrives itll all be gone 
 Disappearing in to the crack of dawn 
 We better make our move now before the sun is awake 
 Its time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace 
 And I dont want to let another minute get by 
 Love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky 
 We may be running out of night but never running out of steam 
 Were acting on a hunch and well be acting out a dream 
 There really isnt any time to lose 
 Theyre going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light 
 Youre such a pretty boy 
 Let me show you what to do and youll do it 
 But you gotta move faster 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Its all we ever wanted 
 And all well ever need 
 And its slipping through our fingers 
 Let me show you how to drive me crazy 
 Let me show you how to make me feel so good 
 Let me show you how to take me to the edge of the stars and then back again 
 Youve gotta show me how to drive you crazy 
 Youve gotta show me all the things you want to happen to you 
 Weve gotta tell each other everything we always wanted someone to do 
 I dont want to push you now and I dont want to rush 
 Were getting closer every second now but close is not enough 
 We got the music in our fingers and the radio 
 Were going to lose it if we wait until it gets too light 
 Faster than the speed of nightOperator number please 
 Its been so many years 
 And shell remember my old voice 
 While I fight the tears 
 Hello hello there is this Martha 
 This is old Tom Frost 
 And I am calling long distance 
 Dont worry about the cost 
 Its been 40 years or more 
 Now Martha please recall 
 And meet me out for coffee 
 Where well talk about it all 
 And those were days of roses 
 Poetry and prose and Martha 
 All I had was you and all you had was me 
 And there was no tomorrows 
 As we packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved it for a rainy day 
 And I feel so much older now 
 And youre much older too 
 Oh hows the husband and hows the kids 
 You know that I got married too 
 Oh lucky that you found someone 
 To make you feel secure 
 Oh cause we were all so young and foolish 
 Now we are mature 
 And I was always so impulsive 
 I guess that I still am 
 But all that really mattered then 
 Was that I was a man 
 I guess that our being together 
 Was never meant to be 
 Oh but Martha oh Martha I love you 
 Cant you see 
 And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to youEverything is permitted 
 Everything is allowed 
 And all our gods we have outwitted 
 We are running with the crowd 
 And all the clocks are showing zero 
 And all our parents must have fled 
 And we just never had no heroes 
 And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead 
 Everything is permitted 
 There is nothing out of bounds 
 There are no limits or no fences 
 There is always some way round 
 And all the compass points are zero 
 And all the navigators fled 
 So if everything is permitted 
 If nothing ever is taboo 
 There there is always something shattered 
 When there is something breaking through 
 If everything is permitted 
 Everything is permittedI was standing with my paper there minding my own news 
 A new world order is on its way well just pass the popcorn please 
 When its a 
 Mad mad world Shake your hands and say good luck 
 Mad mad world I cannot believe this stuff 
 Mad mad world Getting madder every day 
 Mad mad world Get involved and theyll blow you away 
 Mad mad world 
 Want war Shut up cause you aint fought it 
 Mad mad worldYoure sure of what your name is youre sure of where you live 
 You know how much you make ah you know how much you give 
 You know where your house is you know which road to take 
 Ah but youre sure bout lots of things look out theres one mistake 
 There just aint no doubt 
 Theres just one thing youre never too sure about 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 Oh you can never be too sure about the girl 
 You leave her there when you get back 
 She calls you Bill when your name is Jack 
 You know about the truth you can see it in her eyes 
 One thing you know about loveitll cut you down to size 
 You hear what they tell you do you do what youre told 
 And if they say yes does it mean its really so 
 Youre ready for the thrill tonight 
 You think youll take it slow 
 But shes forgotten more boy than you will ever know 
 She calls you up in the middle of the night 
 She says shes lonesome and alone 
 Youre all revved up finally some place to go 
 You knock on that doornobodys home 
 Never can be too sure about that girl 
 Shell drive you crazy boy oh no no 
 Never too sure 
 Never too sure about that girl 
 Ah you can never be too sure about the girl 
 Ah you can never be too sure about the girlBaby we can talk all night 
 But that aint getting us nowhere 
 I told you everything I possibly can 
 Theres nothing left inside of here 
 And maybe you can cry all night 
 But thatll never change the way that I feel 
 The snow is really piling up outside 
 I wish you wouldnt make me leave here 
 I poured it on and I poured it out 
 I tried to show you just how much I care 
 Im tired of words and Im too hoarse to shout 
 But youve been cold to me so long 
 Im crying icicles instead of tears 
 And all I can do is keep on telling you 
 I want you 
 I need you 
 But there aint no way Im ever gonna love you 
 Now dont be sad 
 Cause two out of three aint bad 
 Youll never find your gold on a sandy beach 
 Youll never drill for oil on a city street 
 I know youre looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks 
 But there aint no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box 
 I cant lie 
 I cant tell you that Im something Im not 
 No matter how I try 
 Ill never be able to give you something 
 Something that I just havent got 
 Well theres only one girl that I will ever love 
 And that was so many years ago 
 And though I know Ill never get her out of my heart 
 She never loved me back ooo I know 
 Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night 
 Ah she kissed me and got out of our bed 
 And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door 
 She packed her bags and turned right away 
 And she kept on telling me 
 She kept on telling me 
 Oh I need you 
 Baby we can talk all night 
 But that aint getting us nowhereI left my home in Norfolk Virginia 
 California on my mind 
 I straddled that Greyhound 
 And rode into Raleigh 
 And on across Caroline 
 I had motor trouble that turn into a struggle 
 Halfway across Alabam 
 And that hound broke down and left me all stranded 
 In downtown Birmingham 
 Right away I brought me a through train ticket 
 Ridin across Mississippi clean 
 And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham 
 Smoking into New Orleans 
 Somebody help me get out of Louisiana 
 Just to help me get to Houston Town 
 There are people there who care a little about me 
 And they wont let a poor boy down 
 Sure as youre born brought me a silk suit 
 And put luggage in my hand 
 And I woke up high over Albuquerque 
 On a jet to the Promised Land 
 Working on a Tbone steak a la carte 
 Flying over to the golden state 
 When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes 
 He would set us at the terminal gate 
 Ooh Swing low chariot come down easy 
 Taxi to the terminal zone 
 Cut your engines and cool your wings 
 And let me make it to the telephone 
 Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia 
 Tidewater four ten o nine 
 Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling 
 And the poor boy is on the line 
 Swing low chariot come down easy 
 And the big boy is on the lineYou better pray she took her morning medication 
 Or you might have to pick her up at the police station 
 Cause if theres trouble in this town you know shes gonna find it 
 Shes like the devil in a short skirt but I dont mind it 
 Everybody thinks Im crazy but they dont even know 
 Shes kinda like a rose 
 Shell cut you on the your thumb 
 Shell kick you when youre low 
 And fuck you when shes done 
 The bitch is like a rose 
 And let me tell you son 
 That every time you think youve got control 
 Shshshe got it 
 Maybe Im a victim of infatuation 
 You know that hotblooded girls got my inspiration 
 Yeah it doesnt really matter that she isnt 21 
 Cause shes always backstage when the band gets done 
 She got jagged edges and a dirty mouth 
 What a lady 
 She got everything that I dont wanna live without 
 And you might wanna run 
 Cause even when shes cold 
 Shes burnin like the sun 
 And smokin like a gun 
 Dont care if you dont like her 
 I love her 
 Every time you think youve got control 
 Shshshe got itHeaven can wait 
 And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart 
 Will take me through the lonely night 
 Through the cold of the day 
 And I know I know 
 Heaven can wait 
 And all the gods come down here just to sing for me 
 And the melodys gonna make me fly 
 Without pain without fear 
 Give me all of your dreams 
 And let me go alone on your way 
 Give me all of your prayers to sing 
 And Ill turn the night into the skylight of day 
 I got a taste of paradise 
 Im never gonna let it slip away 
 Its all I really need to make me stay 
 Just like a child again 
 And all Ive got is time until the end of time 
 Well I wont look back I wont look back 
 Let the altars shine 
 And I know that Ive been released 
 But I dont know to where 
 And nobodys gonna tell me now 
 And I dont really care no no no 
 If I had it any sooner you know 
 You know I never would have run away from my home 
 Let the altars shineWell now 
 Goodbye my friend it was good to know you 
 I hope you understand 
 Twentyone years and I aint got nothin 
 But Im sittin here wonderin if I can 
 Wishin and dreamin hopin and reachin 
 For things I was never meant to have 
 If my foolish lifes a product of my gross misconceptions 
 Whos gonna give a damn 
 I dont want 
 Peace on earth 
 I just wanna to go 
 I just wanna to go home 
 Well I know I never was much more than you expected 
 So I expect I wont disappoint 
 But my dreams are not as hollow as the empty world I saw 
 Though I guess I never did get the point 
 Life can not just be the only option left 
 The only thing you can count on in this world is regret 
 I just wanna go 
 I just wanna go home 
 Right world wrong time 
 And they say to me 
 Hang cool teddy bear 
 Best thing to do is just feed em fear 
 Get em thinking about there and forgetin about here 
 Dont try to fight dont try to win 
 When they knock you down 
 You gotta get back up again 
 I dont wanna be an end 
 To break this back and bleed these hands 
 To take my strength and all I am 
 To steal my soul for all your plans 
 I I dont wanna be 
 But Im not so self righteous to think that I 
 Would not take one hundred thousand lives 
 To see oh my mothers eyes 
 And trace that southern smile 
 I dont wanna die 
 I dont want too much more than 
 A working man deserves 
 Just a life worth living 
 And a death worth dying for 
 I so want 
 Oh I so want 
 And I just wanna go home 
 I just want to go home 
 Peace on earthWhy cant the Godz up in heaven assemble 
 An army of battleships bombers and minds 
 To lift up the good and make bad people tremble 
 Things would then be better for the Godz 
 Godz and mankind 
 Why cant the Godz up in heaven assemble 
 In this country  
 A man with a dream needs luck  
 Only if someone with power will help him  
 Can he make all his dreams come true  
 Why dont the Godz take a look at the earth again 
 And give all the children a world they desire 
 Send soldiers and tanks to lift up all the holy ones 
 And attack all the others with cannons 
 Cannons and fire 
 Cannons and fire Fire Fire Damn you crazy man 
 Hit it 
 If it aint real fake it 
 If it aint yours take it 
 If it dont exist you make it 
 If it aint broke break it 
 If its gone to sleep you wake it 
 They give me words to live by and thats all that I know 
 If its all gone bad forsake it 
 If it aint broke break it 
 Hit me 
 Come on 
 Break itMeet me downtown on the corner 
 Ill be waiting in a big yellow cab 
 Dont bring a suitcase 
 You wont need a thing 
 Therell be no worries 
 Where angels sing 
 I got my ticket in my hand 
 Oh the price is paid in full 
 No man can stop me 
 Their words wont sting you 
 No dreams will haunt me 
 Where Angels sing 
 I get so weary 
 On this troubled road 
 Unlock these chains 
 And gently rock me home 
 Beyond the clouds and the rain 
 Where lies cant hurt 
 The flesh desert me 
 No in or out 
 No loss or doubt 
 No living with or doing without 
 Where money aint the power king 
 And kindness is the most precious thing 
 Oh where angels sing 
 Where time means nothing 
 No hustle 
 No one rushing 
 Np dark of night 
 No hate or spite 
 No wrong or right 
 No day or night 
 No towns or no cities 
 Theres no pain no pity 
 Where hunger is no longer 
 And a good man just gets stronger 
 Where angels singThe waves are poundin on the sand tonight 
 I want to take your hand and make it feel so right 
 I know Im ready and Ill never be like this again 
 And the sky is trembling and the moon is pale 
 Were on the edge of forever and were never gonna fail 
 I know youre ready and were runnin on the back of the wind 
 And my body is burnin like a naked wire 
 I wanna turn on the juice 
 I wanna fall in the fire 
 Im gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea 
 Im gonna give you all Im hopin youll be givin to me 
 And when the waves are poundin on the sand tonight 
 I wanna take your hand and make it good and make it right 
 Wow the sky is trembling and the moon is pale 
 How hard 
 How hard do I gotta try 
 I want all of your love 
 Surfs up 
 I need it so bad 
 Surfs up and so am I 
 I gotta give you some love 
 And so am I 
 My body is burnin like a naked wire 
 And so am II cant stand to see it no more the way youre living with a 
 Goddess 
 But you treat her like a slave and you cant hold her back anymore 
 Shes like a dreamer in a dungeon or an Angel in a cave 
 And Ill be closer to you now than any other boy 
 And you know what Im saying is true youre gonna break her up 
 And tear her down and fade her away 
 And then theres no telling what Im gonna do 
 Ill make you pay for everything that you do 
 But if you give me your girl and then you give me your trust 
 And if you give me till the end of the night 
 Im gonna love her for both of us 
 Im gonna give her everything you always wanted to give 
 Im gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live 
 Ill let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun 
 You turned her into a ghost but shell be burning when the night is 
 Done 
 You gotta give me your girl and your trust 
 You cant hide anymore you had a chance and you blew it 
 And youll never get it back and your holiness was never so pure 
 She needs a fire in the heart and not a stabbing in the back 
 And Ive been closer to you now than any other boy 
 So you know what Im saying is true youre gonna break her up 
 And if you give me till the end of the night  
 When the screws are tightnin and the tears are falling 
 I can hear her crying out to be saved and like a bolt of lightning 
 I go answer the call but then 
 Shes singing like a siren to me over the waves 
 I never wanted to take away your lover 
 Until I heard her cry out to be saved 
 I always thought of you as one of my brothers 
 But shes singing like a siren to me over the waves 
 Singing like a siren to me over the waves 
 There aint no holding me down 
 Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give 
 Im gonna love her for both of usBoy 
 When the sky is falling and youre looking round for somewhere to hide 
 Did you ever call out to someone 
 Did you ever call out to me 
 Ive never been gone 
 Ive been right here by your side 
 There aint nothin but clouds 
 There aint nothin but clouds in your eyes 
 Why dont you believe it when you finally found the truth 
 Youve been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth 
 Why dont you stop tearing up everyone you need the most 
 Youre so busy trying to get even 
 You never even try to get close 
 I cant explain it away 
 Doesnt make any sense 
 To know what its like 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 Guess you gotta go through it 
 It doesnt matter baby 
 Loving yous a dirty job 
 Loving you loving yous a dirty job 
 But somebodys gotta do it 
 There were times when wed never fake it 
 There were times we would always make it 
 There were times we would take it to the limit 
 And wed never ever ever leave each other alone 
 We were flesh and blood and bone 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times when we took our chances 
 There were times we were damn good dancers 
 There were times when we heard all the answers 
 In the bleeding of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll 
 I can see right through your soul 
 If your fears could only be forgotten 
 We could pull all the barriers down 
 Would you follow your dreams desire 
 Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire 
 Lets peel out of this town 
 Its been nothing but dreams 
 Its been nothing but dreams until now 
 Youre never gonna see it 
 You got your head stuck in the sand 
 Its the land of the free and easy street 
 Its the home of the damned 
 Oh youre never gonna see it 
 You better open up your eyes 
 Youre the only one whos left 
 Whos gonna believe all your lies 
 It doesnt make any sense 
 You gotta go through it 
 You gotta go 
 There were times when our bodies glistened 
 There were times that we cant stop missing 
 There were times when wed lay in bed and listen 
 To the pounding pounding chorus of our desperate hearts 
 Nothing could have torn us apart 
 There were times we had it all  
 There were times when we fought like tigers 
 There were times we were damn good liars  
 There were times we were damn good liars 
 There were times wed extinguish every fire 
 That was burning burning burning up each other alive 
 From the heavens on down to the dives 
 There were times we lost it all 
 There were times we lost it all  
 There were times that wed lay in bed and listen 
 There were times we lost it all Wasted Youth 
 Wasted Youth 
 I remember everything 
 I remember every little thing as if it only happened yesterday 
 I was barely seventeen and I once killed a boy with a fender guitar 
 I dont remember if it was Telecaster or Stratocaster 
 But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel 
 But I do remember that it wasnt at all easy 
 It required the perfect combination of the right powerchords 
 And the precise angle from which to strike 
 The guitar bled fo about a week afterwards 
 And the blood was zoot dark and rich like wild berrys 
 The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red 
 The guitar bled for about a week afterwards 
 But it rung out beautifully 
 And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before 
 So I took my guitar 
 And I smashed it against the wall 
 I smashed it against the floor 
 I smashed it againt the body of a varsity cheerleader 
 Smashed it against the hood of a car 
 Smashed it against a 1981 HarleyDavidson 
 The Harley howled in pain 
 The guitar howled in heat 
 And I ran upstairs to my parents bedroom 
 Mummy and Daddy were sleeping quietly in the moonlight 
 Slowly I opened the door 
 Creeping into the shadows right up to the foot of their bed 
 I raised the guitar high above my head 
 And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the centre of the bed 
 My father woke up screaming STOP 
 Wait a minute stop it boy What do you think your doing 
 Thats no way to treat an expensive musical instrument 
 And I said God damn it Daddy 
 You know I love you But youve got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n RollCome with me and bless the night 
 Let the darkness be your salvation 
 Curse the day  escape the light 
 Break the chains of imagination 
 Come with me and seize the night 
 Nows the time for some inspiration 
 Leave the day and lose the light 
 No taboos only new sensations 
 In the shadows of the city 
 A heros waiting for the call 
 And all the angels are waking up 
 And all the devils start to fall 
 Theyre dying for a thrill 
 Theyre going out over the edge 
 Theyre moving in for the kill 
 You gotta curse the day its nothing but a merciless light 
 So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees 
 You suck in all the darkness and youre ready now to seize 
 Seize the night 
 Dies irae Kyrie Libera me Domine 
 Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine 
 Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine etc 
 Dies irae Kyrie Sanctus Sanctus exultate 
 Bless the night before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last 
 Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last 
 Let your dreams out of their cages 
 Every passion and desire 
 Let your visions be outrageous 
 Set your fantasies on fire 
 Everything will be permitted 
 Therell be nothing left to fear 
 I got the magic in your body 
 Your inhibitions disappear 
 Bless the night memories collide to change the past 
 Carpe Noctem 
 Come with me and bless the night

 Cry cry to heaven 
 Say a prayer and light a candle

 Go ahead and cry like hell 
 Storm the castle stem the tide 
 Rise above yourself 
 Go ahead and cry like 
 Cry to heaven 
 Cry to heavenIf you were a woman and I was a man 
 Would it be so hard to understand 
 That a hearts heart and we do what we can 
 If you were a woman and I was a man 
 I was a man 
 Hows it feel to be a woman 
 Hows it feel to be a man 
 Are we 
 really 
 that different 
 Tell me where we stand 
 I look at you you look away 
 Why do you say were night and day 
 Id like to try another way 
 Oh baby For just one day 
 If you were a woman and I was a man 
 That a hearts a heart and we do what we can 
 If you were a woman and I was a man 
 Hows it feel to be the hunter 
 Hows it feel to be the prey 
 Is there 
 a reason 
 For this game we play 
 Oh darling for just one day 
 Hey 
 Hey hey 
 Were just two people trying to love 
 Oh but how how can we love 
 With this wall between us 
 Holding us 
 Holding us back 
 Oh If you were a woman and I was a man 
 I was a manThe sirens are screaming and the fires are howling 
 Theres evil in the air and theres thunder in sky 
 Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising 
 Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter 
 Oh baby youre the only thing in this whole world 
 When its over you know 
 Well both be so alone 
 Ill be gone gone gone 
 On a silver black Phantom bike 
 Everything is stunted and lost 
 But with every other beat Ive got left in my heart 
 Well if I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night 
 And like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 Oh I can see myself tearing up the road 
 And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 
 And no ones gonna stop me now 
 Im gonna make my escape 
 And I never see the sudden curve till its way too late 
 Then Im dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 And the last thing I see is my heart 
 Still beating 
 Breaking out of my body and flying away 
 And Im dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Oh like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hell Ill be gone when the morning comes 
 Oh like a bat out of hellI stare in the mirror 
 My eyes refuse to blink 
 Sympathy for me 
 Hell I cant even think 
 Send for the iceman 
 My temperature is startin to rise 
 Ive heard it all before 
 I know the truth from the lies 
 Is it any wonder heavens racked with thunder 
 And all of my dreams go under like the fallin rain 
 Execution day 
 Voices that hover like locusts 
 Keep smothering me 
 Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea 
 Dont touch me now 
 Wont let you crucify me 
 You aint no damn jury 
 You cant pass no sentence on me 
 And all of my dreams go under like the pourin rain 
 Whose blood on whose hands 
 Wheres the promises they preached for this land 
 Standin there with bibles 
 Clutched in their hands 
 Father my hands are shakin 
 I see a light thats breakin 
 Show me the way to set my soul free 
 I hope it rains on me 
 Let it rain on me 
 Execution dayThere were times we had it all 
 There were times we lost it all 
 Ive never been gone Ive been right here by your side 
 Youre so busy trying to get even you never even try to get close 
 Its a dirty job but we can make it 
 There were times when wed always make it 
 There were times when wed take it to the limit 
 And wed never never ever leave each other alone 
 In the beating of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll 
 Somebodys gotta do it 
 Would you follow your dreams desire 
 Lets just peel out of this town 
 Its the land of the free and easy streets 
 Whos gonna believe all your lies 
 There were times we extinguished every fire 
 From the heavens all down to the dives 
 There were times when we fought like tigers 
 There were times we were damn good liars 
 To the pounding pounding chorus of our desperate hearts 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we lost it allBoy 
 Damn car broke down again the heat just did the same 
 I can feel that cold winter wind creeping in again 
 Sometimes it all comes down at once 
 Sometimes when it rains it pours 
 But I wouldnt trade my troubles for any one of yours oh no no 
 Oh baby moneys just money it comes and it goes 
 Things are just things baby so breakable 
 Aint nothing last forever cept our love and our souls 
 Cause I aint that hungry and I have a home 
 I aint fighting for my life and Im not alone ooh 
 So may I pray every morning 
 As I make up the bed 
 Lord all I need today is my daily bread 
 Ooh darlin dont you worry 
 Cause moneys just money it comes and it goes 
 And things are just things baby so breakable 
 Ah 
 Moneys just money it comes and it goes 
 Girl Our soulsFrom the minute I turned and laid eyes on you 
 I had no eyes of my own I was blind to the world 
 You were to good to be true but you were something to see 
 So very young and alone 
 And still I dont believe the way you turned on me 
 Now wheres the girl that I knew 
 You gave me nothing but trouble man I was such a fool 
 You gave me nothing at all now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me Let me count the ways 
 How many hours in how many days 
 How does it amuse you Let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking how many games 
 Go on and take all your stuff dont even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life 
 I know youre laughing at me oh aint it funny and sad 
 Go on and take all your stuff dont even bother to pack 
 Theyre playing with fire and know theyre playing it cool 
 Ill kill you if you dont come backFor the mighty oak to grow 
 You got to plant a tiny seed 
 Words are all you know 
 Body language is what you need 
 I cant barely breathe 
 Your fragrance fill my lungs 
 Its time we started speaking in tongues 
 Speaking in tongues  
 Its that time to start a fire 
 And I know well make it good 
 Were overflowing with desire 
 You got the spark  Ive got wood 
 We got to let our voices soar 
 More than any song weve ever sung 
 There are things we learn by knowledge 
 There are things we learn by heart 
 There are things we learn at the end of life 
 There are things we learn at the start 
 There are things we learn by science 
 There are things we learn by art 
 There are things we learn from the fires of love 
 An erection of the heart 
 An erection of the heart  
 For the mighty oak to grow 
 Speaking in tongues Its getting cold its getting dark 
 The nights are longer everyday 
 The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away 
 And weve been waiting here so long 
 That weve forgotten what its like 
 To run into the fire lookin straight into the 
 Straight into the light 
 Your heart is tryin to rock 
 But it can barely beat at all 
 Your soul is tryin to run 
 But all your body does is crawl 
 You dont need any signal 
 You dont need any sign 
 Nothins gonna stop you once you cross over the line 
 I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back 
 Were tearin down the highway and were breakin away 
 Breakin away 
 Were breakin away from the pack 
 Oh breakin away from the pack 
 And if you dont have anywhere to go 
 You go down on the pedal and youre ready to roll 
 And even if you dont have anywhere to go 
 And your speed its all youll ever need 
 All youll ever need to know 
 You and me were goin nowhere slowly 
 And we gotta get away from the past 
 Theres nothin wrong with goin nowhere baby 
 But we should be goin nowhere fast 
 Everybodys goin nowhere slowly 
 Theyre only fighting for the chance to be last 
 Theres nothing wrong with goin nowhere baby 
 Its so much better goin nowhere fast 
 You shouldnt always see your world so clearly 
 You shouldnt always know your place so well 
 And all were doin here is hangin around 
 And goin anywhere has got to be heaven 
 Cause stayin here is gonna be hell 
 Cause stayin here has gotta be hell 
 Im getting lost Im getting found 
 Im getting born again each day 
 Were dyin on the vine until we finally 
 Till we finally get away 
 The boundaries of this town are closin in just like a noose 
 The futures gonna rust if we dont put it to some 
 Put it to some use 
 Breakin away from the pack 
 Fading out 
 Its so much better goin nowhere fastI want my money back 
 Its all or nothing 
 And nothings all I ever get 
 Every time I turn it on 
 I burn it up and burn it out 
 Its always something 
 Theres always something going wrong 
 Thats the only guarantee 
 Thats what this is all about 
 Its a never ending attack 
 Life is a lemon 
 And I want my money back 
 And all the morons 
 And all the stooges with their coins 
 Theyre the ones who make the rules 
 Its not a game its just a rout 
 Theres desperation 
 Theres desperation in the air 
 It leaves a stain on all your clothes 
 And no detergent gets it out 
 And were always slipping through the cracks 
 Its defective 
 Its always breaking in half 
 Its never built to really last 
 All the batteries are shot 
 Theyre defective 
 All the parts are out of stock 
 Its corroded and decayed 
 Its tattered and its frayed 
 What about your gods 
 They forgot the warranty 
 Its a dead end street to me 
 Its a pack of useless lies 
 Its a crock and then you die 
 What about your childhood 
 Its dead and buried in the past 
 What about your future 
 And you can shove it up your ass 
 Oh I want my money back 
 Life is a lemon 
 Life is a lemon life is a lemon 
 Back back back back 
 Life is a lemonI should have known better 
 Than to let you go alone 
 Its times like these 
 I cant make it on my own 
 Wasted days and sleepless nights 
 An I cant wait to see you again 
 I find I spend my time 
 Waiting on your call 
 How can I tell you babe 
 My backs against the wall 
 I need you by my side 
 To tell me its alright 
 Cause I dont think I can take anymore 
 Is this love that Im feeling 
 Is this the love that Ive been searching for 
 Is this love or am I dreaming 
 This must be love 
 Cause its really got a hold on me 
 A hold on me 
 I cant stop the feeling 
 Ive been this way before 
 But with you Ive found the key 
 To open any door 
 I can feel my love for you 
 Growing stronger day by day 
 An I cant wait too see you again 
 So I can hold you in my arms 
 Is this love or am I dreamingI could start dreaming but it never ends 
 As long as youre gone we may as well pretend 
 Ive been dreaming 
 And thats straight from the heart 
 You said its easy but whos to say 
 That wed be able to keep it this way 
 But its easier 
 Coming straight from the heart 
 Give it to me straight from the heart 
 Tell me we could make another start 
 You know Ill never go 
 As long as I know 
 Its coming straight from the heart 
 Ill see you on the street some other time 
 But all our words will just fall out of line 
 While were dreaming 
 Straight from the heart 
 As long as lknow 
 Its coming straight from the heartHoney theres something Ive got to say to you 
 Oh I know I havent told you before 
 But it wasnt until the other night 
 When you told me you loved me 
 That I felt that I should tell you this 
 You got a smile so bright 
 You know you could have been a candle 
 Youre holding me so tight 
 You know you could have been a handle 
 The way you swept me off my feet 
 You know you could have been a broom 
 The way you smell so sweet 
 You know you could have been some perfume 
 Well you could have been anything that you wanted to 
 And I can tell the way you do the things you do 
 The way you do the things you do 
 As pretty as you are 
 You know you could have been a flower 
 If good looks caused a minute 
 Oh you could have been an hour 
 The way you stole my heart 
 You know you could have been a cool crook 
 And baby youre so smart baby youre so smart 
 You know you could have been a school book 
 You made my life so rich 
 You know you could have been some money 
 And baby youre so sweet 
 You know you should have been some honey 
 Oh life is complete 
 You make my life so bright 
 Oh youre gonna feel all right 
 The way you swept me off my feetI sold my soul to rock n roll 
 When it didnt cost a thing 
 Stacked up scratched up 45s 
 And taught myself how to sing 
 What doesnt it take 
 To be a rock n roll hero 
 Just like the King 
 Livin in a blaze of glory 
 Burnin it up in a smoke filled club 
 Givin your soul to the world 
 Like a rock n roll hero 
 A soldier of fortune in the night 
 Like a r0ck n roll hero 
 When the whitehot lights cut through the night 
 And the sound of the thunder starts rearing 
 Thats when you know what youre saving it for 
 And you know the feeling like a rock n roll hero 
 I owe it all to rock n roll 
 And I wouldnt want to change a thing 
 Got this old guitar strapped round my neck 
 And my baby waitin in the wings 
 What doesnt it take to be a rock n roll hero 
 Just like the king 
 A spark in your eyes a flame in your soul 
 And you know the feeling like a rock n roll heroThe skies were pure and the fields were green 
 They said He crashed and burned 
 Oh God it seems so very far 
 May appear closer than they are they are they are 
 Caution Kids at play 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat nowLost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner and all around the world 
 Lost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner and all around all around the world 
 It doesnt matter where theyre going 
 Or wherever theyve been 
 Cause theyve got one thing in common its true 
 Theyll never let a night like tonight go to waste 
 And let me tell ya something neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 Weve gotta fast we were born out of time 
 Born out of time and alone 
 And well never be as young as we are right now 
 Runnin away and runnin for home 
 Runnin for home 
 Down on the corner and all around and all around the world
