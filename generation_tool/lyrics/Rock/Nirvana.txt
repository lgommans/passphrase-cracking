I need an easy friend 
 I do with an ear to lend 
 I do think you fit this shoe 
 I do but you have a clue 
 Ill take advantage while 
 You hang me out to dry 
 But I cant see you every night free 
 I do 
 Im standing in your line 
 I do hope you have the time 
 I do pick a number two 
 I do keep a date with you 
 I need an easy friend 
 But I cant see you every night 
 No I cant see you every night 
 Free 
 I doBig cheese make me 
 Mine says go to the office 
 Big cheese make me 
 Mine says one that stays 
 Black is black straight back 
 Need more enemies 
 Show you all what a man is 
 Big lies make my 
 Message 
 What is it 
 She is glue how are you 
 Sure you are but what am I 
 Sure you are but what am IMusic and Lyrics Kurt Cobain 
 Whats the season in a right if you cant have anything 
 Whats the reason in a rhyme if a plan means everything 
 Whats the meaning in a crime Its a fan if anything 
 Wheres the leaning in a line Its a crime its a crime 
 How a culture comes again It was all here yesterday 
 And you swear its not a trend doesnt matter anyways 
 Youre only hear to talk to friend nothing new is every day 
 You could shit upon the stage theyll be fans 
 Theyll be fans 
 All the kids will eat it up if its packaged properly 
 Steal a sound and imitate keep a format equally 
 Not an ode just the facts where our world is nowadays 
 An idea is what we lack it doesnt matter anyways 
 Hey  
 Hey This song is for lovers out there 
 And the little light in the trees 
 And all the flowers have gingivitis 
 And the birds fly happily 
 Well be together once again my love 
 I need you back oh baby baby 
 I cant explain just why we lost it from the start 
 Living without you girl youll only break my heart 
 I can feel it I can hold it 
 I can bend it I can shape it I can mold it 
 I can cut it I can taste it 
 I can spank it beat it masturbate it 
 I been looking for day glo 
 Always hearing the same ol 
 Say you want to be faithful 
 I can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever couldHold me theres too much tension 
 Degrade me Im fucking hungry 
 Help me Im fucking cornered 
 Grade me you make it more 
 Lightning fucking around in my head 
 Fierce dangerous pathetic fucked up 
 People freaking every day 
 White lights inside 
 What do you want 
 Cold naked man picked off his scabs and 
 Fed them to the pigeons 
 Help him hes fucking cornered 
 Grade him it might be fun 
 Hold me somethings happening 
 Help me somebody help me 
 Hold me Im fucking hungry 
 Help me Im right here who are you 
 Naked man you say you saw 
 Fed them to the pigeons 
 Grade him it might be fun 
 Help me Im fucking hungry 
 Help me Im fucking up 
 Hold me some fucking helpRunny nose and runny yolk 
 Even if you have a cold still 
 You can cough on me again 
 I still havent had my fulfill 
 In the someday whats that sound 
 Broken heart and broken bones 
 Think of how a castrated horse feels 
 One more quirky cliched phrase 
 Youre the one I wanna refill 
 Spoken interlude 
 Most people dont realize 
 That two large pieces of coral 
 Painted brown and attached to his skull 
 With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer 
 That two large pieces of coral 
 With common wood screws can make a child look like a deerCome on over and do the twist ahha 
 Overdo it and have a fit ahha 
 Love you so much it makes me sick ahha 
 Come on over and do the twist ahha 
 Beat me outta me beat it beat it

 Come on over and shoot the shit ahha 
 She keeps it pumpin straight to my heart 
 She keeps it pumpin straight to my heartIf I may 
 And if I might 
 Lie me down 
 Weeping 
 And if I say 
 What its like 
 I might be 
 Dreaming 
 If I may 
 What is right 
 Some make time 
 To see me bleed 
 Those years in his bonet 
 A phrase from his pocket 
 And chains of a knowing 
 Life long dream 
 Dream 
 Do re mi 
 Wake me up 
 And see me 
 And if I do 
 And if I lie 
 Find me out 
 At sea 
 And if I may 
 Cold as ice 
 I might have to 
 See me 
 The rays in his socket 
 A phrase from this moment 
 The chase on his socket I will need 
 Wish me good 
 Wish made light 
 Hes under a wave 
 Just be quiet 
 Follow pain 
 And grieving 
 Yell oh well 
 And if I sigh 
 Seek me out 
 Teeming 
 If I might 
 Golden gun 
 To bleed 
 And praise in his pocket 
 Rays from his women 
 Chains from his knowing 
 DreamUntil my tensions feed me 
 Feed me 
 Im fucking hungry 
 Degrade me 
 I want my complex 
 Lifes a fuckin resume 
 Experience credentials 
 Experienced imposter 
 People freaking everyday 
 White lies 
 Sitting inside 
 Lady is sitting with another little fucker and its 
 Blasphemy 
 Mommy has a vendetta against daddy 
 The Walls are set up 
 Baby is sad to find that daddy 
 Exports illegally 
  
 Hold me theres too much tension 
 Im fuckin hungry 
 Feed me I want some comfort 
 Consume me I want my complex back 
 Cold naked man 
 Picked off his scabs 
 And fed them 
 To the pigeons 
 Help him hes cornered 
 Kill him you mercy mourner 
 Experienced credentials 
 White lies running inside 
 Hold me no fucking rules 
 Just help me 
 Im too pretentious 
 Please me Im really hungry 
 Degrade me I want my complex backIm long gone from vertical 
 Somewhere south is stopping me 
 Im long gone from the American dream 
 You may decide its something new 
 Im long gone but Ill let you through 
 You may decide its not for you 
 You may decide theres nothing there 
 Hold it in your gut 
 You may decide that its not good 
 Im long gone but Ill let you leave 
 You may decide on stopping me 
 Im long gone but Ill let you lose 
 You may decide on stopping me 
 GoneGoodbye my friend its hard to die 
 When all the birds are singing in the sky 
 And all the birds are everywhere 
 Pretty girls are everywhere 
 Think of me and Ill be there 
 Goodbye Papa please pray for me 
 I was the black sheep of the family 
 And I dont know how this works 
 I had bought thee turds 
 With my BB gun I would kill birds 
 We had joy We had fun 
 We had seasons in the sun 
 But the hills that we climb 
 Were just seasons out of time 
 All our lives we had fun 
 But the stars that we reached 
 Were just starfish on the beach 
 Goodbye Michelle my little one 
 The following two lines were murmured during the boxset video and were visibly forgotten as evidenced by Kurts chuckle 
 You gave me love and helped me find the sun 
 And every time that I was down 
 All my tears are salty 
 I think now I was start to weep 
 Were just starfish on the beachWe passed upon the stair 
 We spoke of was and when 
 Although I wasnt there 
 He said I was his friend 
 Which came as a surprise 
 I spoke into his eyes 
 I thought you died alone 
 A long long time ago 
 Oh no not me 
 We never lost control 
 Youre face to face 
 With the man who sold the world 
 I laughed and shook his hand 
 And made my way back home 
 I searched for form and land 
 For years and years I roamed 
 I gazed a gazely stare 
 We walked a million hills 
 I must have died alone 
 Who knows not me 
 I never lost control 
 With the man who sold the worldTo hope is admittance 
 Feed before beginning 
 Doublesided cynics 
 Reflected images 
 Dont be so selfish 
 Leaving the image 
 Follow it far 
 To find where you are 
 You havent grown 
 Go on alone 
 Never finished his sentence 
 Remained in seclusion 
 For the next few days 
 Family is circuling 
 He having moved up 
 All the styles of heresy 
 Finally he appeared unexpectedly 
 Looking for companyI could I can shit anywhere 
 And I promised a girl I would shit on the stage 
 Oh that sound and falling no 
 I chose to shit anywhere 
 And I promise to shit on your head 
 Cannot make out next 3 lines 
 God I shit Ill shit anywhere 
 And I go when I chose to 
 Trained on your face 
 Right and god oh god Ill wipe my helmet 
 Want my safe 
 Im new wave 
 Ah Im new wave 
 Im old school 
 Im new wave and not straight 
 Im new wave mumblingHmm I just wanna know do you like me 
 Use just once and destroy 
 Invasion of our piracy 
 Afterbirth of a nation 
 Starve without your skeleton key 
 I love you for what I am not 
 I do not want what I have got 
 A blanket acneed with cigarette burns 
 Speak at once while taking turns 
 What is what I need 
 What is wrong with me 
 This had nothing to do with what you think 
 If you ever think at all 
 Bipolar opposites attract 
 All of a sudden my water broke 
 Secondrate third degree burns 
 What do I think I think 
 Hate your enemies 
 Save save your friends 
 Find find your place 
 Speak speak the truth 
 What do I think I thinkShe eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak 
 Ive been locked inside your heartshaped box for weeks 
 Ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap 
 I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black 
 Hey Wait 
 Ive got a new complaint 
 Forever in debt to your priceless advice 
 Your advice 
 Meateating orchids forgive no one just yet 
 Cut myself on angel hair and babys breath 
 Broken hymen of your highness Im left black 
 Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back 
 She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak 
 Your adviceAh here she comes now now 
 Here she comes now now 
 Here she comes now 
 Ah she looks so good 
 Ah shes made out of wood just look and seeBell door on clanks come on in 
 Floyd observes my hairy chin 
 Sit down chair dont be afraid 
 Steamed hot towel on my face 
 I was shaved 
 Barney ties me to the chair 
 I cant see Im really scared 
 Floyd breathes hard I hear a zip 
 Pee pee pressed against my lips 
 I sense others in the room 
 Opey Aunt Bea I presume 
 They take turns and cut me up 
 I died smothered in Andys clutch 
 I was shamed 
 I was shamedCongratulations you have won 
 Its a years subscription of bad puns 
 And a makeshift story of concern 
 And to set it off before it burns 
 My opinions Mmm Mmm 
 And there seems to be a problem here 
 Your state of emotion seems to clear 
 You rise and fall like wall street stock 
 And you had an affect on our happy talk 
 Our opinions Mmm Mmm 
 Now there seems to be a problem here 
 The scale of your emotions seems too clear 
 Now they rise and fall like wall street stock 
 And they have an affect on our peace talks my opinion 
 Your opinions Mmm Mmm 
 My opinions Mmm MmmMy girl my girl dont lie to me 
 Tell me where did you sleep last night 
 In the pines in the pines 
 Where the sun dont ever shine 
 I would shiver the whole night through 
 My girl my girl where will you go 
 Im goin where the cold wind blows 
 Her husband was a hard working man 
 Just about a mile from here 
 His head was found in a drivin wheel 
 But his body never was found 
 My girl my girl dont lie to me 
 Tell me where did you sleep last night 
 Im going where the cold wind blows 
 In the pines the pines 
 Sun shine 
 I shiver the whole night throughMusic  Lyrics Kurt Cobain 
 Portray sincerity act out of loyalty 
 Defend every country wish away pain 
 Hand out lobotomies to save little families 
 Surrealistic fantasy bland boring plain 
 Hold me down in restitution 
 Living out your date with fusion 
 Is the whole thing shun in bastard 
 Dont feel guilty masturbating 
 Somebody said that theyre not much like I am 
 I know I can 
 Make enough of the words as you go along 
 I sink then some 
 Slippery pessimist hypocrite master 
 Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard 
 Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth 
 I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst 
 Is the whole fleece shun in bastard 
 I sing then someShe should have stayed away from friends 
 She should have had more time to spend 
 She should have died when she was born 
 She should have worn the crown of thorns 
 She should have been a son 
 She should have stood out in a crowd 
 She should have made her mother proud 
 She should have fallen on her stance 
 She should have had another chance 
 She should have stayed away from friends 
 She should have been a sonLoad up on guns bring your friends 
 Its fun to lose and to pretend 
 Shes overbored and selfassured 
 Oh no I know a dirty word 
 Hello hello hello hello 
 Hello hello hello how low 
 Hello hello how low how low 
 Hello hello hello 
 With the lights out its less dangerous 
 Here we are now entertain us 
 I feel stupid and contagious

 And for this gift I feel blessed 
 Our little group has always been 
 And always will until the end 
 And I forget just why I taste

 Straight as an arrow 
 Dimension seven 
 Dimension sevenI was born in the wagon of a travelling show 
 My momma used to dance for the money theyd throw 
 Poppa would do whatever he could 
 Preach a little gospel 
 Sell a couple bottles of doctor good 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 Wed hear it from the people of the town 
 Theyd call us 
 But every night all the men would come around 
 And lay their money down 
 Picked up a boy just south of Mobile 
 Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal 
 I was sixteen he was twenty one 
 Rode with us to Memphis 
 And poppa woulda shot him if he knew what hed done 
 Yip 
 Yahoo 
 She was born in the wagon of a travelling show 
 Her momma had to dance for the money theyd throw 
 Grandpad do whatever he could 
 Blahblahblahblah

 One more high to decay my nervous 
 Wondering how Im gonna find a way 
 Its over 
 One more day to complete my service 
 One more time here to fade my servant 
 One more day if I find a way 
 Over 
 She seemed to read minds 
 And I know a later time 
 We could make it with you 
 Leave the soul 
 Old age 
 One more day to complain my servant 
 One more doubt here to find a servant 
 One more time here if I find a way 
 Wondering how Im here date my cover

 One more day to concrete my circuit 
 One more high here to find my nervous 
 Someday Im gonna find a way 
 One more doubt here to claim my supper 
 I can have anything you want to 
 And I know we were out of time 
 Breathe the way here with you 
 Dream the same on the dew 
 Breathe the same on her 
 Take a moan on a man 
 Breathe the shame on you 
 Breathe the lie 
 Old ageFill me in on your new vision 
 Wake me up with indecision 
 Help me trust your might and wisdom 
 Yes I eat cow I am not proud 
 Show me how you question question 
 Lead the way to my temptations 
 Take my hand and keep it clean 
 Easy in an easychair 
 Poop as hard as rock 
 I dont like you anyway 
 Seal it in a box 
 Im new 
 Now you 
 Fill me in on your new vision 
 AhHey fellas have you heard the news 
 You know that Annies back in town 
 It wont take long just watch and see 
 All the fellas lay their money down 
 Her style is new but the face the same 
 As it was so long ago 
 But from her eyes a different smile 
 Like that of one who knows 
 Well its been ten years and maybe more 
 Since I first set eyes on you 
 The best years of my life gone by 
 Here I am alone and blue 
 Some people cry and some people die 
 By the wicked ways of love 
 But Ill just keep on rollin along 
 With the grace of the Lord above 
 People talkin all around 
 Bout the way you left me flat 
 I dont care what the people say 
 I know where their jive is at 
 One thing I do have on my mind 
 If you can clarify please do 
 Its the way you call me another guys name 
 When I try to make love to you 
 I try to make love but it aint no use 
 Give it to me give it 
 Work so hard I cant unwind 
 Get some money saved 
 Abuse my love a thousand times 
 However hard I tried 
 Heartbreaker your time has come 
 Cant take your evil ways 
 Go away heartbreaker 
 Heartbreaker heartbreaker heartMy baby taught me how to be 
 My baby taught me how to fight 
 My baby taught me how to die 
 Alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol 
 My baby taught me how to smoke 
 My baby taught me how to breathe 
 My baby taught me how to hide 
 My baby taught me how to leave 
 My baby taught me how to choke 
 My baby taught me how to eat 
 My baby taught me how to fuck 
 My baby taught me how to be 
 Alcohol alcohol alcohol alcoholIts not cold enough 
 Please put this end up 
 She is moving through 
 Can we show our faces now 
 Im not interesting 
 Shes not turning green 
 Shameful as it seems 
 Endless climb 
 I am blind 
 Why cant I hear 
 Color blind 
 Speaking a phrase 
 Instantly grown 
 Waiting in line 
 Its not cold enough 
 Please put this side up 
 Why am I sureOh itchy flakes it isnt through me 
 Till the jaws in flames its entertaining 
 True the fungus mold is my attraction 
 Oh its only a disinfection 
 Only hurts when I it hurts when I pee 
 Only hurts when I it hurts when I sleep 
 I vomit cum and diarrhea on the tiled floor like oatmeal pizza 
 Fill my toilet bowl of a cloudy puss 
 I feel my blood becoming chowder rust 
 Only hurts a night it hurts when I pee 
 Only hurts a night until I sleep 
 Roll into my bed which does consist of lice bugs and fleas and 
 And yellow mucus 
 Stained dirt Vaseline toe jam and boogers 
 Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared slusdgeWe come from the land of the ice and snow 
 From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow 
 Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands 
 To fight the horde and sing and cry 
 Valhalla I am coming 
 On we sweep with the threshing oar 
 Our only goal will be the western shore 
 We come from the land of the ice and snow 
 How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore 
 Of how we calmed the tides of war 
 We are your overlords 
 So now youd better stop and rebuild all your ruins 
 For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losingFight tuberculosis folks 
 Christmas Eve an old junkie selling Christmas seals 
 On North Park Street 
 The Priest they called him 
 Fight tuberculosis folks 
 People hurried by gray shadows on a distant wall 
 It was getting late and no money to score 
 He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife 
 Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight 
 Boy got out with a suitcase 
 Thin kid in prep school clothes 
 Familiar face the Priest told himself 
 Watching from the doorway 
 Reminds me of something a long time ago 
 The boy there with his overcoat 
 Unbuttoned reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare 
 The cab drove away and turned the corner 
 The boy went inside a building 
 Hmm yes maybe the suitcase was there in the doorway 
 The boy nowhere in sight 
 Gone to get the keys most likely have to move fast 
 He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner 
 Made it glanced down at the case 
 It didnt look like the case the boy had or any boy would have 
 The Priest couldnt put his finger on what was so old about the case 
 Old and dirty poor quality leather and heavy 
 Better see whats inside 
 He turned into Lincoln Park 
 Found an empty place and opened the case 
 Two severed human legs that belonged to a young man 
 With dark skin shiny black leg hairs 
 Glittered in the dim streetlight 
 The legs had been forced into the case 
 And he had to use his knee on the back of the case to shove them out 
 Legs yet he said and walked quickly away with the case 
 Might bring a few dollars to score 
 The buyer sniffed suspiciously 
 Kind of a funny smell about it 
 Its just Mexican leather 
 Well some joker didnt cure it 
 The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor 
 Not even right sure he killed it whatever it is 
 Three is the best I can do and it hurts 
 But since this is Christmas and youre the Priest 
 He slipped three bills under the table into the Priests dirty hand 
 The Priest faded into the street shadows seedy and furtive 
 Three cents didnt buy a bag nothing less than a nickel 
 Say remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back 
 Unless I paid him the three cents I owe him 
 Yeah isnt that a fruit for ya blow your stack about three lousy cents 
 The doctor was not pleased to see him 
 Now what do you want I told you 
 The Priest laid three bills on the table 
 The doctor put the money in his pocket and started to scream 
 Ive had trouble People have been around 
 I may lose my license 
 The Priest just sat there 
 Eyes old and heavy with years of junk on the doctors face 
 I cant write you a prescription 
 The doctor jerked open a drawer 
 And slid an ampule across the table 
 Thats all I have in the office The doctor stood up 
 Take it and get out he screamed hysterical 
 The Priests expression did not change 
 The doctor added in quieter tones 
 After all Im a professional man 
 And I shouldnt be bothered by people like you 
 Is that all you have for me One lousy quarter G 
 Couldnt you lend me a nickel 
 Get out get out Ill call the police I tell you 
 All right doctor Im going 
 Of course it was cold and far walk to rooming house 
 A shabby street room on the top floor 
 These stairs coughed the Priest 
 There pulling himself up along the bannister 
 He went into the bathroom 
 Yellow wall panels toilet dripping 
 And got his works from under the washbasin 
 Wrapped in brown paper back to his room 
 Get every drop in the dropper 
 He rolled up his sleeve 
 Then he heard a groan from next door 
 Room 18 the Mexican kid lived there 
 The Priest had passed him on the stairs 
 And saw the kid was hooked 
 But he never spoke because he didnt want any juvenile connections 
 Bad news in any language 
 The Priest had had enough bad news in his life 
 He heard the groan again a groan he could feel 
 No mistaking that groan and what it meant 
 Maybe he had an accident or something 
 In any case I cant enjoy my priestly medications 
 With that sound coming through the wall 
 Thin walls you understand 
 The Priest put down his dropper 
 Cold hall and knocked on the door of Room 18 
 Quien es 
 Its the Priest kid I live next door 
 He could hear someone hobbling across the floor 
 A bolt slid the boy stood there in his underwear shorts 
 Eyes black with pain he started to fall 
 The Priest helped him over to the bed 
 Whats wrong son 
 Its my legs señor cramps 
 And now I am without medicine 
 The Priest could see the cramps 
 Like knots of wood there in the young legs 
 Dark shiny black leg hairs 
 A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race 
 It was then that the cramps started 
 And now he has the leg cramps back 
 With compound junk interest 
 The old Priest stood there feeling the boy groan 
 He inclined his head as if in prayer went back and got his dropper 
 Its just a quarter G kid 
 I do not require much señor 
 The boy was sleeping when the Priest left Room 18 
 He went back to his room and sat down on the bed 
 Then it hit him like heavy silent snow 
 All the gray junk yesterdays 
 He sat there received the immaculate fix 
 And since he was himself a priest 
 There was no need to call oneMusic and Lyrics Kurt Cobain 
 I wasnt seeking him for a father 
 Not only magnets but I could pry bar his shaft 
 Gluing my manhood to ze manhole said in a smarmy French accent 
 Like Peppy Lepew would say 
 Heyheyhey then we clash 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily 
 Shouldntve asked buddy 
 Shrinking in flesh if the wind blows just right 
 Jacking themselves off polyester 
 Highwater jumpsuits and uh right 
 Hey when am I getting it back 
 I dont know why 
 I got a joke too silly string 
 Dont touch the balls 
 I got a dick dick  hear my fucking hey 
 If youre worried its gaining monthly 
 Fiberglass insulation disguised as cotton candy 
 Smiling down Steve El Rancho Ovule sp 
 Feeding a cow hamburger raw 
 Bill has brought me a Tiki idol 
 Philly Slim reminds me of someone 
 Im sick of playing Father Love Bone 
 Tony and Tennille Sonny Bono Charo 
 Had a nice set of lungs 
 I got my philly spayed 
 I got a little tail 
 Hard 
 I gotta be around pussy 
 Dont let me fall 
 I got a heyhey 
 Well you cant live 
 We got my diddily spayed 
 I got diddily spayed 
 I got diddilyAnd if you save yourself 
 You will make him happy 
 Hell keep you in a jar 
 And youll think youre happy 
 Hell give you breathing holes 
 Hell cover you with grass 
 And youll think youre happy now 
 Youre in a laundry room 
 Conclusion came to you 
 And if you cut yourself 
 You will think youre happy 
 And youll make him happy 
 And if you fool yourself 
 Then you will seem happy 
 Youll wallow in your shit 
 Then youll think youre happy now 
 Conclusion came to youTake a pill

 Hurry up

 A desire is whats for you 
 Is it real a lulliby 
 Face to face with an unamed mouth 
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Feel the spirit form in his eyes was loving for 
 And his lions were raging high hunts himself and fears his ripe 
 HeyIll start this off without any words 
 I got so high I scratched till I bled 
 Love myself better than you 
 I know its wrong so what should I do 
 The finest day that Ive ever had 
 Was when I learned to cry on command 
 Im on a plain I cant complain 
 Im on a plain 
 My mother died every night 
 Its safe to say dont quote me on that 
 The black sheep got blackmailed again 
 Forgot to put on the zip code 
 Somewhere I have heard this before 
 In a dream my memory has stored 
 As a defense Im neutered and spayed 
 What the hell am I trying to say 
 It is now time to make it unclear 
 To write off lines that dont make sense 
 And one more special message to go 
 And then Im done then I can go home 
 Im on a plainJesus dont want me for a sunbeam 
 Sunbeams are not made like me 
 Dont expect me to cry 
 For all the reasons you had to die 
 Dont ever ask your love of me 
 Dont expect me to lie 
 Dont expect me to die for thee 
 Jesus dont want me for a sunbeam 
 Dont expect me to die 
 Dont expect me to die for theeTake a step out of yourself 
 And you turn around 
 Take a look at who you are 
 Its pretty scary 
 So silly 
 Its revolting 
 Youre not much 
 If youre anything 
 Yeah 
 Take a step outside the city 
 Take a look at where you are 
 It is revolting 
 Youre really nowhere 
 So wasteful 
 So foolish 
 Poppycock 
 Who said dont look back 
 Dont believe em 
 Go for that crazy sounding restaurant 
 Cause theyre gonna try and get behind you 
 Dont you let em do it 
 You know what Im talking about 
 You hear me talking 
 Its pretty scary totally its so revolting 
 Nah 
 Take a step out of the country 
 It is amazing 
 Take a good look 
 Youre no big deal 
 Youre so petty 
 Its a laugh 
 Oh

 She likes to be 
 Shes into guilt

 Would you like to hear my voice 
 Sprinkled with emotion 
 Vented at your birth

 Mashed potatoes and stuff like that 
 I couldnt chew my meat too good 
 She said well dont you start your crying 
 Go outside and ride your bike

 After dinner I had ice cream 
 I fell asleep and watched TV 
 I woke up in my mothers arms 
 I wanna be aloneMany a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau 
 Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know 
 Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand 
 To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands 
 Theres nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop 
 And an illustrated book about birds 
 You see a lot up there but dont be scared 
 Who needs action when you got words 
 When youve finished with the mop then you can stop 
 And look at what youve done 
 The plateaus clean no dirt to be seen 
 And the work it was fun 
 Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau 
 Some say it was in Greenland and some say Mexico 
 Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood 
 But those were all just guesses wouldnt help you if they couldShe says shes changed 
 She says shes cured 
 She says shes mine

 They travel far to keep their stomachs full 
 They make their living off of arts and crafts 
 The kind with seashells driftwood and burlap 
 They make a deal when they come to town 
 The Sunday swap meet is a battleground 
 She loves him more than he will ever know 
 He loves her more than he will ever show 
 Keep the cigarettes close to his heart 
 Keeps her photographs close to her heart 
 Keep the bitterness close to the heart 
 They lead a lifetime that is comfortable 
 Keeps her photographs close to his heart 
 She loves him more than she will ever know 
 Keep the bitterness close to the heartClean up before she comes 
 Clean up before she comes 
 Living in a dusty town 
 Something in her eyes

 Come On Death 
 Some versions of this song might be different because its not an official album trackIf you wouldnt mind I would like it blew 
 If you wouldnt mind I would like to lose 
 If you wouldnt care I would like to leave 
 If you wouldnt mind I would like to breathe 
 Is there another reason for your stain 
 Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain 
 Here is another word that rhymes with shame 
 If you wouldnt mind I would like it blew 
 Is there another reason for your stain 
 You could do anything 
 You could do anythingNeither side is sacred no one wants to win 
 Feeling so sedated think Ill just give in 
 Taking medication till my stomachs full 
 Either side is sacred growing in my home Alt Crawling in my hole 
 Grass is greener over here 
 Youre the fog that keeps me clear 
 Reinventing what would you do 
 Take your time and Ill be true 
 Youre the reason I feel pain 
 Feels so good to feel again 
 Neither side is sacred no one wants to win 
 Feeling so sedated but I cant give in 
 Even medication till my stomachs full 
 Feeling so sedated when Im in my home

 Oh Like most babies smell like butter 
 His smell smelled like no other 
 He was born scentless and senseless 
 He was born a scentless apprentice 
 Away 
 Go away go away 
 Every wet nurse refused to feed him 
 Electrolytes smell like semen 
 I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets 
 There are countless formulas for pressing flowers 
 I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms 
 Leaking the gas well make into perfume

 Throw me in the fire and I wont throw a fit

 Go away go awayYoure my favorite 
 Of my saviours 
 Youre my favorite

 Of my favors

 To remind me when not to be calm to remind me what not to become 
 To remind me when not to be calm

 I cant let you smother me 
 Id like to but it couldnt work 
 Trading off and taking turns

 Wanted more than I could steal 
 Ill arrest myself Ill wear a shield 
 Ill go out of my way to prove I still 
 Smell her on you

 Afraid of never knowing fear 
 Experience anything you need 
 Ill keep fighting jealousy 
 Until its fucking gone 
 And Ive got this friend you see 
 Truth covered in security 
 Ill go out of my way to make you a deal 
 Well make a pact to learn from who 
 Ever we want without any rules

 Cherryflavored antacids 
 Im anemic royaltyWhere do bad folks go when they die 
 They dont go to heaven where the angels fly 
 They go to a lake of fire and fry 
 See em again till the fourth of July 
 I knew a lady who came from Duluth 
 Bit by a dog with a rabid tooth 
 She went to her grave just a little too soon 
 And flew away howlin on the yellow moon 
 Where do bad folks go when they die 
 See em again till the fourth of July 
 People cry and people moan 
 They look for a dry place to call their home 
 Try to find some place to rest their bones 
 While the angels and the devils try to make em their own 
 See em again till the fourth of JulyNow I found 
 Im alone 
 Now I found him here 
 Screaming 
 Hole in his head 
 Death now comes with that Nevermind 
 Now opponents said Nirvana 
 Where theres nothing left to shoot 
 People on MTV 
 Wear flowers in their hair 
 But for the sake of life and libery and 
 Put off alone 
 So dont follow him 
 You only felt the buckets of the raqueteer 
 Hey Hey 
 My mind 
 Like a drug that finds you dreaming 
 It takes it just because it can 
 Like a gun that finds you sleeping 
 Guilty just because its said 
 Solo 
 Thats a lot of plants 
 Thats a lot of trees 
 Another promises 
 Then will hurt you 
 And its gone Kurt 
 Long live the Queen 
 Make shifts over the buckets of the raqueteer 
 Like the drug that finds you dreaming 
 Now the opponents said Nirvana 
 Like a killer like a man 
 Like a blowWhen I looked you in the eye 
 I knew it was time for goodbye 
 You were the only one I had around 
 But you couldnt keep your feet on the ground 
 Run rabbit run 
 But whats that youre runnin for 
 You aint gonna run no more 
 Bye bye baby bye bye bird 
 Thought the cold sidewalk stones 
 Broke your little brittle bones 
 I know you were already dead 
 When the truck rolled over your head 
 Bye bye baby bye bye birdMusic and Lyrics Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic 
 I was your mind you were my my enemy 
 You were mine I was your your enemy 
 You would mind I was your your enemy 
 You were mine I was was your your ene 
 You rang 
 Your ears rang 
 At night The Wishful goddess 
 At night Shell wish the hardest 
 At night The disco goddess 
 At night The bitch go gawd 
 At night The wishful goddess 
 On Sight The disco goddess 
 At night The itch so modest 
 At night The Crisco lochness 
 At night The mouthful omelette 
 Out Sight The fishfilled goblets 
 At night The witch go GawdAt my feeding time 
 She pushed food through the door 
 And I crawl towards the crack of light 
 Sometimes I cant find my way 
 Newspapers spread around soaking all that they can 
 A cleaning is due again a good hosing down 
 The lady whom I feel maternal love for 
 Can not look me in the eyes 
 But I see hers and they are blue 
 And they cock and twitch and masturbate 
 Ah 
 I said so 
 Nirvana 
 Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails 
 I see others just like me why do they not try to escape 
 They bring out the older ones they point in my way 
 They come with a flash of light and take my family away 
 And very later I have learned to 
 Accept some friends or ridicule 
 My whole existence is for your amusement 
 And that is why Im here with you 
 To take 
 Me with 
 Youre right 
 NirvanaTo hope is admittance 
 Reflected image 
 Leave in me this 
 The family circle noose 
 He had removed us 
 Looking for companyIm not like them I can pretend 
 The sun is gone I have a light 
 The day is done Im having fun 
 I think Im dumb maybe just happy 
 Think Im just happy 
 My heart is broke I have some glue 
 Help me inhale mend it with you 
 We float around hang out on clouds 
 Then well come down have a hangover 
 Have a hangover 
 Skin the sun fall asleep 
 Wish away soul is cheap 
 Lesson learned wish me luck 
 Soothe the burn wake me up 
 Im not like them I can pretend 
 The sun is gone but I have a light 
 The day is done but Im having fun 
 I think Im dumb 
 I think Im dumbTobi

 Im gonna open up myself a flea market 
 Im gonna open up myself a flea market 
 And youre gonna wish that you did 
 And retire on the profits 
 First off 
 Im gonna empty out all of my Mrs Butterworth jars 
 And Im gonna put em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21 
 Shop 
 And then I am going to put my Mrs Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf 
 Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups Ive accumulated 
 Over the past 62 years 
 Then Im going to get some plywood 
 Im going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two feet squares 
 Then Im going to get some burlap and Im going to cut them into 
 Two by two feet squares and then Im going to put them onto the 
 Pieces of plywood 
 And then Im going to go to the beach 
 Im going to go to the beach and Im gonna collect some 
 Shells and driftwood 
 And then Im going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them 
 Onto the plywood and burlap 
 And sell em for lots of money 
 People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new 
 Toys and clothing 
 Then maybe someday I can get rid of that 
 Pissedstained matress Ive been sleeping on 
 Im gonna die on my libido 
 Im gonna die watch the painWont you believe it its just my luck 
 Wont you believe it its just my luck
