We sail tonight for Singapore, we're all as mad as hatters here 
 I've fallen for a tawny Moor, took off to the land of Nod 
 Drank with all the Chinamen, walked the sewers of Paris 
 I danced along a colored wind, dangled from a rope of sand 
 You must say goodbye to me 
 We sail tonight for Singapore, don't fall asleep while you're ashore 
 Cross your heart and hope to die when you hear the children cry 
 Let marrow, bone, and cleaver choose while making feet for children shoes 
 Through the alley, back from hell, when you hear that steeple bell 
 You must say goodbye to me 
 Wipe him down with gasoline 
 Till his arms are hard and mean 
 From now on boys, this iron boat's your home 
 So heave away, boys 
 We sail tonight for Singapore, take your blankets from the floor 
 Wash your mouth out by the door, the whole town's made of iron ore 
 Every witness turns to steam, they all become Italian dreams 
 Fill your pockets up with earth, get yourself a dollar's worth 
 Away boys, away boys, heave away 
 The captain is a one-armed dwarf 
 He's throwing dice along the wharf 
 In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king 
 So take this ring 
 We sail tonight for Singapore, we're all as mad as hatters here 
 I've fallen for a tawny Moor, took off to the land of Nod 
 Drank with all the Chinamen, walked the sewers of Paris 
 I drank along a colored wind, I dangled from a rope of sand 
 You must say goodbye to meWell I hung on to Mary's stump 
 I danced with a soldier's glee 
 With a rum soaked crook 
 And a big fat laugh 
 I spent my last dollar on thee 
 I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell 
 Kehoe spiked the nog 
 With a chain link fence 
 And a scrap iron jaw 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog 
 Spider rolled in from 
 Hollister Burn 
 With a one-eyed stolen Mare 
 Donned himself with chicken fat 
 Sawin on a jaw bone violin there 
 Kathleen was sittin' down 
 In little reds recovery room 
 In her criminal underwear bra 
 I was naked to the waist 
 With my fierce black hound 
 And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road 
 Fill it with madrone and bay 
 Stinks like hell 
 Don't give a hoot what they say 
 Slap that hog 
 Gotta roll 'em over twice 
 Baste him with a sweeping broom 
 You gotta swat them flies 
 And chain up the dogs 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs 
 Old brown Betty with a yellow wig 
 Tain't the mince meat filagree 
 And it ain't the turkey neck stew 
 And it ain't them bruleed 
 Okra seeds though she 
 Made them especially for you 
 Worse won a prize for her 
 Bottom black pie 
 The beans got to thrown to the dogs 
 Jaheseus Christ I can always 
 Make room when they're 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring HogNow you're gone 
 And it's hotels and whiskey and sad-luck dames 
 And I don't care if they miss me 
 I never remember their names 
 They say if you get far enough away 
 You'll be on your way back home 
 Well, I'm at the station 
 And I can't get on the train 
 Must be blind love, only kind of love is stone blind love 
 Blind love, the only kind of love is stone blind love 
 With your blind love, oh, it's blind love 
 Stone blind love, it's your stone blind love 
 Now the street's turning blue 
 The dogs are barking and the night has come 
 And there's tears that are falling 
 From your blue eyes now 
 I wonder where you are 
 And I whisper your name 
 The only way to find you 
 Is if I close my eyes 
 I'll find you with my blind love, the only kind of love is stone blind love 
 The only kind of love is stone blind love 
 The only kind of love is stone blind love 
 With your blind love, oh your blind love, your stone blind love 
 It's your blind love, the only kind of love is stone blind love 
 Stone blind love, the only kind of love is stone blind love 
 With your blind love, the only kind of love is stone blind love 
 Stone blind love, stone blind loveHell above and Heaven below 
 All the trees are gone 
 The rain makes such a lovely sound 
 To those who are six feet under ground 
 The leaves will bury every year 
 And no one knows I'm gone 
 Live me golden tell me dark 
 Hide from Graveyard John 
 The moon is full here every night 
 And I can bathe here in his light 
 The leaves will bury every year 
 And no one knows I'm goneIt's dreamy weather we're on 
 You waved your crooked wand 
 Along an icy pond 
 With a frozen moon 
 A murder of silhouette crows I saw 
 And the tears on my face 
 And the skates on the pond 
 They spell Alice 
 I'll disappear in your name 
 But you must wait for me 
 Somewhere across the sea 
 There's a wreck of a ship 
 Your hair is like meadow grass 
 On the tide 
 And the raindrops on my window 
 And the ice in my drink 
 Baby, all I can think of 
 Is Alice 
 Arithmetic, arithmetock 
 Turn the hands back on the clock 
 How does the ocean rock the boat? 
 How did the razor find my throat? 
 The only strings that hold me here 
 Are tangled up around the pier 
 And so a secret kiss 
 Brings madness with the bliss 
 And I will think of this 
 When I'm dead in my grave 
 Set me adrift and I'm lost over there 
 And I must be insane 
 To go skating on your name 
 And by tracing it twice 
 I fell through the ice 
 Of Alice 
 And so a secret kiss 
 Brings madness with the bliss 
 And I will think of this 
 When I'm dead in my grave 
 Set me adrift and I'm lost over there 
 And I must be insane 
 To go skating on your name 
 And by tracing it twice 
 I fell through the ice 
 Of Alice 
 There's only AliceOh 
 I ain't going down 
 I ain't going down 
 Oh, honey to the well no more 
 Oh. 
 And I ain't got nothing 
 Oh, and I can't stand nothing 
 Oh. 
 I ain't going down 
 I ain't going down 
 Oh, sweet mama to the well no more 
 Oh. 
 You said you was a true believer 
 I'm the true believer 
 I'm a true believer 
 Oh. 
 I ain't going down 
 I ain't going down 
 Oh, mama to the well no more 
 Oh.Life is whittled 
 Life's a riddle 
 Man's a fiddle that life plays on 
 When the day breaks 
 And the earth quakes 
 Life's a mistake all day long 
 You tell me, who gives a good goddamn 
 You'll never get out alive 
 Don't go dreaming 
 Don't go scheming 
 A man must test his mettle 
 In a crooked ol' world 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whale 
 Oh you're starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whale 
 Don't take my word 
 Just look skyward 
 They that dance must pay the fiddler 
 Sky is darkening 
 Dogs are barking 
 But the caravan moves on 
 You tell me who gives a good goddamn 
 You'll never get get out alive 
 Don't go dreaming 
 Don't go scheming 
 A man must test his mettle 
 In the crooked ol' world 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whale 
 Oh we're starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whale 
 Ha! 
 As the crow flies 
 It's there the truth lies 
 At the bottom of the well 
 E-o-leven 
 Goes to Heaven 
 Bless the dead here as the rain falls 
 Don't trust a bull's horn 
 A doberman's tooth 
 A runaway horse or me 
 Don't be greedy 
 Don't be needy 
 If you live in hope you're dancing to a terrible tune 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whale 
 Oh starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly 
 Starving in the belly of a whaleRudy's on the midway 
 And Jacob's in the hole 
 The monkey's on the ladder 
 The devil shovels coal 
 With crows as big as airplanes 
 The lion has three heads 
 And someone will eat 
 The skin that that he sheds 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 And the earth did screaming 
 While I lay dreaming, dreaming of you 
 Well, hell doesn't want you 
 And heaven is full 
 Bring me some water 
 Put it in this skull 
 I walk between the raindrops 
 I wait in bug house square 
 And the army ants 
 They leave nothing but the bones 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 Dreaming of you 
 There was thunder, there was lightning 
 And then the stars went out 
 And the moon fell from the sky 
 It rained mackerel, it rained trout 
 And the great day of wrath has come 
 And here's mud in your big red eye 
 The poker's in the fire 
 And the locusts take the sky 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 And the earth died screaming 
 While I lay dreaming 
 Dreaming of you 
 Dreaming of you, of you, of you(Jack Kerouac) 
 I left New York in 1949 
 To go across the country without a bad blame dime 
 Montana in the cold cold fall 
 Found my father in the gambling hall 
 Father, Father where you been? 
 I've been out in the world and I'm only ten 
 Father, Father where you been? 
 I've been out in the world and I'm only ten 
 Don't worry about me if I should die of pleurisy 
 Across to Mississippi, across to Tennessee 
 Across the Niobrara, home I'll never be 
 Home in ol' Medora, home in Ol' Truckee 
 Apalachicola, home I'll never be 
 Better or for worse, thick and thin 
 Like being married to the Little poor man 
 God he loves me (God he loves me) 
 Just like I love him (just like I love him) 
 I want you to do (I want you to do) 
 Just the same for him (just the same for him, yeah) 
 Well the worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind 
 So I left Monatana on an old freight train (on an old freight train) 
 The night my father died in the cold cold rain (in the cold cold rain) 
 Road to Opelousas, road to Wounded Knee 
 Road to Ogallala home I'll never be 
 Road to Oklahoma, road to El Cahon 
 Road to Tahachapi, road to San Antone 
 Hey, hey 
 Road to Opelousas, road to Wounded Knee 
 Road to Ogallala, home I'll never be 
 Road to Oklahoma, road to El Cahon 
 Road to Tahachapi, road to San Antone 
 Home I'll never be, home I'll never be 
 Home I'll never be, home I'll never be 
 Home I'll never be, home I'll never beDid you hear the news about Edward? 
 On the back of his head 
 He had another face 
 Was it a woman's face 
 Or a young girl? 
 They said to remove it would kill him 
 So poor Edward was doomed 
 The Face could laugh and cry 
 It was his devil twin 
 At night she spoke to him 
 Of things heard only in Hell 
 They were impossible to separate 
 Chained together for life 
 Finally a bell tolled his doom 
 He took a suite of rooms 
 And hung himself and her 
 By the balcony irons 
 Some still believe he was freed from her 
 But I knew her too well 
 I say she drove him to suicide 
 And took Poor Edward to HellThey shot him down 
 They shot him down 
 They thought he was a monster 
 But he was the King 
 They came to his island 
 And they brought her with them 
 They wanted to get his picture 
 But they were surprised by his enormous size 
 And when he saw the woman 
 He took her without question 
 Because after all 
 He was the King 
 And he loved the woman 
 He loved the way she looked 
 And she wouldn't stop screaming 
 But he loved the woman 
 And he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex 
 And it was a bloody battle 
 But he fought it for his woman 
 And he climbed up a mountain 
 And he looked around 
 Some kind of forest 
 With all these dinosaurs 
 And he stripped his woman 
 He stripped her bare 
 But there was a pterodactyl 
 There! 
 And then a hero 
 Came and took his woman 
 And they fell off the mountain 
 Into some water 
 And then later 
 He came looking for his woman 
 But they were waiting 
 And they threw a bomb 
 And they tied him 
 And took him across the ocean 
 And they chained him 
 And put him in the show 
 And when he saw his woman 
 He broke loose 
 And everyone fled in terror 
 And he was looking for her 
 And he overtook a train 
 And he was looking in the street 
 And then he found her in her apartment 
 And he climbed up the Empire State building 
 It was like a phallic symbol 
 And he took his woman 
 To the top of that towering temple 
 And he climbed up and looked around 
 Some kind of city 
 With all those skyscrapers 
 And all the cars 
 Just him and his screaming woman 
 And they were finally alone 
 He loved his woman 
 You could see it in his eyes 
 His great big eyes 
 He loved his woman 
 From the moment that he saw her 
 He was all choked up inside 
 But when the airplanes came 
 He was soon to die 
 But he hung on long enough to set his woman down 
 And make sure that she was safe 
 And as the bullets pierced 
 He looked at her so sincere 
 Before he fell 
 Because he loved his woman 
 And they shot him down 
 They thought he was a monster 
 But he was the King 
 Who killed the monkey 
 'Twas beauty that killed the beast 
 And Willis O'Brien died 
 A tragic death 
 There wasn't much 
 That he had left 
 And Ray Harryhousen said 
 That when Willis died 
 That's when the King was really dead 
 They shot him down 
 They shot him down 
 They thought he was a monster 
 But he was the KingThere's a place for us 
 Somewhere a place for us 
 Peace and quiet, open air 
 Wait for us somewhere 
 There's a time for us 
 Some day a time for us 
 Time together with time to spare 
 Time to learn 
 Time to care 
 Someday 
 Somewhere 
 We'll find a new way of living 
 We'll find a way of forgiving 
 Somewhere 
 There's a place for us 
 A time and a place for us 
 Hold my hand and we're halfway there 
 Hold my hand and I'll take you there 
 Somehow 
 Someday 
 SomewhereYou dance real slow 
 You wreck it down 
 You walk away, then you 
 Turn around 
 What did that old blonde 
 Gal say? 
 That is the part... 
 You throw away 
 I want that beggars eyes 
 A winning horse 
 A tidy Mexican divorce 
 St. Mary's prayers 
 Houdini's Hands 
 And a Barman who always 
 Understands 
 Will you loose the flowers 
 Hold on to the vase 
 Will you wipe all those teardrops 
 Away from your face 
 I can't help thinking 
 As I close the door 
 I have done all of this 
 Many times before 
 The bone must go 
 The wish can stay 
 The kiss don't know 
 What the lips will say 
 Forget I've hurt you 
 Put stones in your bed 
 And remember to never 
 Mind instead 
 Well all of your letters 
 Burned up in the fire 
 Time is just memory 
 Mixed in with Desire 
 That's not the road it is 
 Only the map... I say 
 Gone just like matches 
 From a closed down cabaret 
 In a Portuguese Saloon 
 A fly is a circling around 
 The room 
 You'll soon forget the 
 Tune that you play 
 For that is the part 
 You throw away 
 Ah, that is the part 
 You throw awayWell the eggs chase the bacon 
 Round the fryin' pan 
 And the whinin' dog pidgeons 
 By the steeple bell rope 
 And the dogs tipped the garbage pails 
 Over last night 
 And there's always construction work 
 Bothering you 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 Friday's a funeral 
 And Saturday's a bride 
 Sey's got a pistol on the register side 
 And the goddamn delivery trucks 
 They make too much noise 
 And we don't get our butter 
 Delivered no more 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 Well big mambo's kicking 
 His old grey hound 
 And the kids can't get ice cream 
 'Cause the market burned down 
 And the newspaper sleeping bags 
 Blow down the lane 
 And that goddamn flatbed's 
 Got me pinned in again 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 There's a couple filipino girls 
 Gigglin' by the church 
 And the windoe is busted 
 And the landlord ain't home 
 And butch joined the army 
 Yeah that's where he's been 
 And the jackhammer's diggin' 
 Up the sidewalks again 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhood 
 In the neighborhoodTight-slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift 
 'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift 
 Cigar chewing Charlie's in that newspaper nest 
 Griftin' hot horse tips on who's running the best 
 And I'm blinded by the neon 
 Don't try to change my tune 
 'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone 
 I'm drunk on the moon 
 And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars 
 Broadway's like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars 
 Laramer is teeming with that undulating beat 
 And some Bonneville is screaming its way wilder down the street 
 And I'm blinded by the neon 
 Don't try to change my tune 
 'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone 
 I'm drunk on the moon 
 Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane 
 Tarts mutter their dream, hopes the night will ordain 
 Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight 
 As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound and it cuts through the night 
 And I've hocked all my yesterdays 
 Don't try and change my tune 
 'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone 
 I'm drunk on the moonShe lives in a house 
 That's way back off the road 
 There's a man with a lantern 
 And he carries her soul 
 A coal stove and a bed 
 A skillet and a hound 
 She drove a camel through 
 A needle 
 In this sinking board walk town 
 She's my Black Market Baby 
 She's my Black Market Baby 
 She's a diamond that 
 Wants to stay coal 
 Wants to stay coal 
 I swang out wide with her 
 On hells iron gate 
 Anything that you wanted 
 You could have 
 My eyes say their prayers to her 
 Sailors ring her bell 
 Like a moth mistakes a light bulb 
 For the moon and goes to hell 
 She's my Black Market Baby 
 She's my Black Market Baby 
 She's a diamond that 
 Wants to stay coal 
 Wants to stay coal 
 There's no prayer like desire 
 There's amnesia in her kiss 
 She's a swan and a pistol 
 And she will follow you like this 
 In Moverly, Missouri at the 
 Iroquois Hotel 
 She checked in with the President 
 And she ran up quite a Bill 
 She's whiskey in a teacup 
 She gives blondes a lousy name 
 She's a Bonzai Aphrodite 
 And a ticket back to Spain 
 She's a hard way to go 
 And there ain't no way 
 To stop 
 Every time you play the red 
 The black is coming up 
 She's my Black Market baby 
 She's my Black Market baby 
 She's a diamond that 
 Wants to stay coal 
 Wants to stay coalThe bats are in the belfry 
 The dew is on the moor 
 Where are the arms that held me 
 And pledged her love before 
 And pledged her love before 
 And it's such a sad old feeling 
 All the fields are soft and green 
 It's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 I made a golden promise 
 That we would never part 
 I gave my love a locket 
 And then I broke her heart 
 And then I broke her heart 
 And it's such a sad old feeling 
 All of the fields are soft and green 
 And it's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 We've running through the graveyard 
 And we laughed, my friends and I 
 We swore we'd be together 
 Until the day we died 
 Until the day we died 
 It's such a sad old feeling 
 All of the fields are soft and green 
 And it's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 And it's such a sad old feeling 
 The fields are soft and green 
 And it's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dreamMet you in the saddle 
 Rode you in the dust 
 Held your hand to the heavens 
 Pulled your heart to the earth 
 Something blinded me more than the mist 
 And the breath of the cottonwood 
 Buds lighter yet 
 When you rode the maypole of dance hall legs 
 And galloped to another's embrace 
 I bit the flowers from your wrist corsage 
 And you waltzed too slowly 
 Too slowly you waltzed 
 With that girl from Widow's Grove 
 Oh I'd follow you to the river 
 That washes out to the sea 
 Through the wind, through the rain 
 Of a cold dark night 
 It's where I'll be 
 Near the breath of a swallow 
 Petals dropped as I fell 
 As you grabbed then shyly held me 
 Against the stone cold well 
 In your hand was a glass 
 You held the ice against the night 
 And it dripped and it sparkled and 
 I laughed a wish 
 Before it all slipped down the dark, tunneled well 
 I heard it melt quietly and 
 I looked at you 
 Bent to the earth with one pleading wish 
 My skirts brushed to the furious pounding 
 Oh I'd follow you to the river 
 That washes out to the sea 
 Through the wind, through the rain 
 Of a cold dark night 
 It's where I'll be 
 I hid in the elm and raised the bough 
 That hung even with your neck 
 And I chased you and drowned you there 
 Deep in the well 
 And when your mouth was full and wet 
 I swallowed all your reckless fate 
 And with your last breath 
 You moaned too drunk to wake 
 Oh I'd follow you to the river 
 That washes out to the sea 
 Through the wind, through the rain 
 Of a cold dark night 
 It's where I'll beI got your letter today 
 And I miss you all so much here 
 I can't wait to see you all 
 And I'm counting the days, dear 
 I still believe that there's gold 
 At the end of the world 
 And I'll come home to Illinois 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 It is so hard and it's cold here 
 And I'm tired of taking orders 
 And I miss old Rockford town 
 Up by the Wisconsin border 
 What I miss you won't believe 
 Shoveling snow and raking leaves 
 And my plane will touch down 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 I close my eyes every night 
 And I dream that I can hold you 
 They fill us full of lies everyone buys 
 About what it means to be a soldier 
 I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel 
 About all the blood that's been spilled 
 Will God on his throne get me back home 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 You can't deny the other side 
 Don't want to die any more than we do 
 What I'm trying to say is don't they pray 
 To the same God that we do 
 And tell me how does God choose 
 Whose prayers does he refuse 
 Who turns the wheel, who throws the dice 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 I'm not fighting for justice 
 I am not fighting for freedom 
 I am fighting for my life 
 And another day in the world here 
 I just do what I've been told 
 We're just the gravel on the road 
 And only the lucky ones come home 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 And the summer, it too will fade 
 And with it brings the winter's frost, dear 
 And I know we too are made 
 Of all the things that we have lost here 
 I'll be twenty-one today 
 I've been saving all my pay 
 And my plane will touch down 
 On the day after tomorrow 
 And my plane, it will touch down 
 On the day after tomorrowJack was sittin' poker faced with bullets backed with bitches 
 Neal hunched at the wheel, puttin' everyone in stitches 
 Braggin' 'bout some nurse he screwed while drivin' through Nebraska 
 And when she came she honked the horn 
 And Neal just barely missed a truck 
 And then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to Californy 
 You see, a red head in a uniform will always get you horny 
 Yeah, and with her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat 
 She drove like Andy Granatelli and knew how to fix a flat 
 And Jack was almost at the bottom of his MD 2020 
 Neal was yellin' out the window, tryin' to buy some bennies 
 From a Lincoln full of Mexicans and the left rear tire blowed 
 And the sons of bitches pretty near almost ran us off the road 
 And while the nurse had spilled the Maneshewitz all up and down her dress 
 And then she lit the map on fire, Neal just had to guess 
 Should we try and find a bootleg route or a fillin' station open 
 The nurse was dumpin' out her purse and lookin' for an envelope 
 And Jack was out of cigarettes and as we crossed the yellow line 
 The gas pumps looked like tombstones from here 
 And it felt lonelier than a parking lot 
 When the last car pulls away 
 And the moonlight dressed the double breasted foothills in the mirror 
 Weaving out a negligee and a black brassiere 
 And the Mercury was runnin' hot, we were almost out of gas 
 Just then Florence Nightingale she dropped her drawers and 
 Stuck her fat ass halfway out of the window to a Wilson Pickett tune 
 And shouted, "Get a load of this." and gave the finger to the moon 
 Countin' one eyed Jacks and whistlin' Dixie in the car 
 Neal was doin' least a hundred when we saw a fallin' star 
 And Florence wished that Neal would hold her 'stead of chewin' on his cigar 
 Jack was noddin' out and wishin' he was in a bar 
 With Charlie Parker on the bandstand and not a worry in the world 
 And a glass of beer in one hand and his arms around a girl 
 Neal was singin' to the nurse, "Underneath the Harlem Moon" 
 And somehow you could just tell we'd be in California soon 
 Open up your golden gates 
 California, here I come 
 I said, California, here I come 
 Look out, California, here I comeSticks and stones will break my bones 
 But I always will be true 
 And when your mama's dead and gone 
 I'll sing this lullaby just for you 
 And what becomes of all the little boys 
 Who never comb their hair 
 They're lined up all around the block 
 On the nickel over there 
 So you better bring a bucket 
 There is a hole in the pail 
 And if you don't get my letter 
 Then you'll know that I'm in jail 
 And what becomes of all the little boys 
 Who never say their prayers 
 They're sleepin' like a baby 
 On the nickel over there 
 If you chew tobacco 
 And wish upon a star 
 You'll find out where the scarecrows sit 
 Just like punchlines between the cars 
 And I know a place where a royal flush 
 Never beat a pair 
 Even Thomas Jefferson 
 Is on the nickel over there 
 So ring around the rosie 
 You're sleepin' in the rain 
 You're always late for supper 
 Man, you let me down, let me down again 
 I thought I heard a mockingbird 
 Roosevelt knows where 
 You can skip the light with Grady Tuck 
 On the nickel over there 
 So what becomes of all the little boys 
 Who run away from home 
 The world just keeps gettin' bigger 
 Once you get out on your own 
 So here's to all the little boys 
 The sandman takes you where 
 You're sleepin' with a pillowman 
 On the nickel over there 
 So climb up through that button hole 
 And fall right up the stairs 
 And I'll show you where the short dogs grow 
 On the nickel over thereThat's the way the stomach rumbles 
 That's the way the bee bumbles 
 That's the way the needle pricks 
 That's the way the glue sticks 
 That's the way the potato mashes 
 That's the way the pan flashes 
 That's the way the market crashes 
 That's the way the whip lashes 
 That's the way the teeth gnashes 
 That's the way the gravy stains 
 That's the way the moon wanesWell, I got a bad liver and a broken heart 
 Yeah, I drunk me a river since you tore me apart 
 And I don't have a drinking problem, 'cept when I can't get a drink 
 I wish you'd a-known her, we were quite a pair 
 She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer 
 So welcome to the continuing saga 
 She was my better half and I was just a dog 
 And so here am I slumped, I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool 
 So buy this fool some spirits and libations 
 It's these railroad station bars 
 And all these conductors and the porters 
 And I'm all out of quarters 
 And this epitaph is the aftermath 
 Yeah, I choose my path, hey, come on, Kath 
 He's a lawyer, he ain't the one for ya 
 No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell 
 And some guy's trying to sell me a watch 
 So I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain scotch 
 I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems 
 You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise 
 I ain't sentimental 
 This ain't a purchase, it's a rental and it's purgatory 
 And hey, what's your story? Well I don't even care 
 'Cause I got my own double cross to bear 
 Well, I'll see your Red Label and I'll raise you one more 
 And you can pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more 
 'Cause it don't douse the flames that are started by dames 
 It ain't like asbestos 
 It don't do nothing but rest us assured 
 And substantiate the rumors that you've heardSmelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp 
 Ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp 
 Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town 
 Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground 
 Bazanti bootin al zootin al hoot and Al Cohn 
 Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole 
 In a fishnet stockings, spike-heel shoes 
 Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues 
 And the porno floor show, live nude girls 
 Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls 
 Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose 
 Raise my rent and take off all your clothes 
 With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum 
 She's so good, make a dead man come 
 Pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot 
 Portland through the shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze 
 Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie 
 And Fifi live from Gay Paree 
 Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares? 
 All this hot burlesque for me 
 Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips 
 From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips 
 Chopped and channeled and lowered and lewd 
 And the cheater slicks and baby moons 
 She's a-hot and ready, creamy and sugared 
 And the band is awful and so are the tunes 
 Crawling on her belly and shaking like jelly 
 And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres 
 And cheers from the (hmm) compendium here 
 "Hey sweetheart" they're yelling for more 
 You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor 
 And I like Shelly and you like Jane 
 And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name? 
 And it's an early-bird matinee, come back any day 
 Get you a little something that you can't get at home 
 Get you a little something that you can't get at home 
 It's pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot 
 Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze 
 Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite 
 And I'll be back tomorrow night 
 And I'll be back tomorrow nightYou're the tree that you can't 
 Eat the fruit from 
 I heard horses came to 
 Ride me away - I want shade 
 And a good place to shoot from 
 If I's a clock I'd be the end of the day 
 You know you're not the boss of me 
 You can lift your skirt 
 You can shake your hair 
 But I got all the time in the world 
 You're the ditch in the road where the 
 Wheels keep spinning. You're the same dead cat 
 Clawing it's way back grinning. You know 
 You got a bad reputation and you're nine lives 
 Way down the line. I got a jacket to put on 
 And a hat to wear. I wouldn't waste a 
 Gallon on you out there and I got all 
 The time in the world 
 A bridge is only there for you to jump 
 Off of. And there ain't no rain clouds 
 That are blue. I do declare my 
 Independence baby I shot off all my 
 Fireworks for you. The river's burning 
 And the trees are on fire 
 There's lots of good rubber left on these tires 
 And I've got all the time in the world 
 Baby you're the light that won't change 
 That I got suck at 
 You're the fan that won't work 
 At the motel 
 They were all out of red so I got 
 Me a blue one 
 Baby you're always using mine, why you get 
 You one. I know you won't go very far 
 You left your blonde wig in the car 
 And I got all the time in the worldWell, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue 
 Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to 
 Harold's club is closing and everybody's going on home 
 What's a poor boy to do? 
 I'll just get on back into my short 
 Make it back to the fort 
 Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain 
 There's got to be someplace that's better than this 
 This life I'm leading's driving me insane 
 And let me tell you, I'm dreaming 
 Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight 
 This town has got me down 
 I've seen all the highlights 
 I've been walking all around 
 Won't make a fuss 
 I'll take a Greyhound bus 
 Carry me away from here 
 Oh, tell me, what have I got to lose? 
 'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue 
 Bars all are closing, 'cause it's quarter to two 
 Every town I go to is like a lock without a key 
 Blues I leave behind keep catching up on me 
 Let me tell you, they're catching up on me 
 They're catching up on me 
 Catching up on me 
 Catching up on me 
 Catching up on meFriday left me fumblin' with the blues 
 And it's hard to win when you always lose 
 Because the nightspots spend your spirit 
 Beat your head against the wall 
 Two dead ends and you've still got to choose 
 You know the bartenders, they all know my name 
 And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame 
 And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head 
 When I should be living clean instead 
 You know, the ladies I've been seeing off and on 
 Well, they spend your love and then they're gone 
 You can't be lovin' someone who's savage and cruel, yeah 
 Take your love and then they leave on out of town, know they do 
 Well now, fallin' in love is such a breeze 
 But its standin' up that's so hard for me 
 I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back 
 You know your perfume, well it won't let me be 
 And you know the bartenders all know my name 
 And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame 
 And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head 
 When I should be living clean instead 
 Come on baby, let your love light shine 
 Gotta bury me inside of your fire 
 Because your eyes are enough to blind me 
 You're like looking at the sun 
 You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one 
 Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one 
 Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one 
 Come on and whisper tell me I'm the onePoor little lamb now his fleece is all cold 
 Wakes up in the morning alone 
 Poor little lamb knows what's coming 
 Life is an empty cup 
 Poor little lamb, watch your shoulder 
 Coyote's waiting out there 
 Nobody will get any older 
 If we don't find a way out of here 
 So let's go on a bummer this summer 
 Where we won't have to be afraid 
 The world will be on a hummer, boys 
 And we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonadeThe piano has been drinking 
 My necktie is asleep 
 And the combo went back to New York 
 The jukebox has to take a leak 
 And the carpet needs a haircut 
 And the spotlight looks like a prison break 
 And the telephone's out of cigarettes 
 And the balcony is on the make 
 And the piano has been drinking 
 The piano has been drinking 
 And the menus are all freezing 
 And the light man's blind in one eye 
 And he can't see out of the other 
 And the piano tuner's got a hearing aid 
 And he showed up with his mother 
 And the piano has been drinking 
 The piano has been drinking 
 'Cause the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler 
 Cream-puff Caspar Milquetoast 
 And the owner is a mental midget 
 With the I.Q. of a fence post 
 'Cause the piano has been drinking 
 The piano has been drinking 
 And you can't find your waitress 
 With a Geiger counter 
 And she hates you and your friends 
 And you just can't get served without her 
 And the box office is drooling 
 And the bar stools are on fire 
 And the newspapers were fooling 
 And the ashtrays have retired 
 'Cause the piano has been drinking 
 The piano has been drinking 
 The piano has been drinking 
 Not me, not me, not me, not me, not meWell I stood on the corner 
 Until my feet got wet 
 I stood by the faucet 
 Till the sink filled up 
 I stood by the window 
 Until the moon came up 
 My baby's bought a ticket 
 Long as my clothes line 
 My baby went and left me in a '49 Ford 
 Going down the highway in a 49 sword 
 My baby ripped my heart out 
 With every turn of the moon 
 Somebody told me 
 There's never been a rose without a thorn 
 Well I'm just another sad guest 
 On this dark earth 
 And if I was a tree 
 I'd be a cut down tree 
 And if I was a bed 
 I'd be an unmade bed 
 I'll get my 32/20 and it'll have to do 
 Gone like the wind in the meadow 
 And the rain on the hill 
 You even left your lipstick 
 And your powder and your blush 
 Baby gonna leave me 
 On a Grey Hound bus 
 The stars are melting 
 All across the sky 
 I let the dog out 
 But he didn't come back 
 Stood on the corner until 
 My feet got wet 
 Baby leave me in a '49 Ford 
 I stood by the window 
 Until the moon came upWell, I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
 'Cause falling in love just makes me blue 
 Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see 
 I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me 
 And I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
 Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere 
 And I wonder, should I offer you a chair 
 Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it 
 Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it 
 And I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
 Well, the night does funny things inside a man 
 These old tomcat feelings you don't understand 
 Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette 
 I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met 
 And I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
 I can see that you are lonesome just like me 
 And it being late, you'd like some company 
 Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me 
 The guy you're with, he's up and split, the chair next to you's free 
 And I hope that you don't fall in love with me 
 Now, it's closing time, the music's fading out 
 Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout 
 Well, I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found 
 I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round 
 And I think that I just fell in love with youWell time is always money 
 For the boys on Union Square 
 Go on and bust your ass till doomsday 
 Don't forget to say your prayers 
 Someone's riding down the backstreet 
 Said papa got a brand new slack 
 And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat 
 Sit right there, boy and you relax 
 C'mon honey, we're all going down, down, down, downtown 
 Down downtown 
 We're going down downtown 
 We're going down downtown 
 Well, you spill out of the Cinema Fourteen 
 To that drag bar there on the block 
 Whizzin' on down in front of the East Coast 
 Bank rolled up on your sock 
 She stand right there for your pleasure 
 Half Puerto Rican Chinese 
 You got to find your baby somebody to measure 
 I'm going to get me some of these, baby 
 C'mon honey, do you hear what I'm doing now? 
 Down, down, down, down, down, down downtown 
 Down downtown 
 I'm going down downtown 
 'Bout four in the morning on a Sunday 
 Sacco drinking whiskey in church 
 Half pint of Festival brandy 
 That boy 'bout to fall right off his perch 
 Well, that guy in the sweater's off duty 
 Well, he's out in front of that welfare hotel 
 The guy in the dress is a beauty 
 Go all the way, I swear you never can tell 
 C'mon honey and pull up your socks 
 Down, down, down 
 I'm going down, down, down, downtown 
 Down downtown 
 Down, down, down 
 Down, down, down 
 C'mon down downtown 
 Going down downtown 
 I'm going down downtownWhere the Iceman's mule is parked outside the bar 
 Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar 
 And the German dwarf dances the butcher's son 
 And tonight a little rain never hurt no one 
 Where they're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down 
 And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves 
 And a little trouble makes it worth the going 
 And a little rain never hurt no one 
 Oh, the world is round and so I'll go around 
 You must risk something that matters 
 Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here 
 If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride 
 She was 15 years old and she'd never seen the ocean 
 She climbed into a van with a vagabond 
 And the last thing she said was "I love you, mom" 
 And a little rain never hurt no one 
 And a little rain never hurt no one(Waits) 
 Well let's see, we had the eh, we had the Fairlane. 
 Then the u-joints went out on that and the bushings and then your mother wanted to trade it in on the Tornado, so we got the Tornado. 
 God, I hated the color of that son of a bitch. 
 And the dog destroyed the upholstery on the Ford. 
 Boy, that was long before you were born. 
 We called it the Yellowbird, two-door, three on the tree. 
 Tight little mother. 
 Threw a rod, sold it to Jacobs for a hundred dollar. 
 Now the Special eh, four-holer, you've never seen body panels lining up like that. 
 Overhead cam, dual exhaust. 
 You know I had, let's see I had, four Buicks, loved them all. 
 Now your Uncle Emmet, well he drives a Thunderbird, it used to belong to your Aunt Evelyn. 
 Now, she ruined it, drove it to Indiana with no gear oil. 
 That was the end of that! 
 Sold that Cadillac to your mom. 
 Your mom loved that Caddy. 
 Independent rear suspension, 
 Landau top, good tires. 
 Gas hog. 
 I swear it had the power to repair itself. 
 I love the old, Dan Steele used to give 'em to me at a discount. 
 Showroom models and that. 
 And then there was the Pontiac and... 
 God, I loved that Pontiac. 
 Well, it was kind of an ox-blood. 
 It just kinda handled so beautifully. 
 Yeah, I miss that car. Well, it was a long time ago, a long time ago.(You got to) Lie to me baby

 Splashin' bagdad on the hudson in panther martin's eyes 
 He's high and outside wearin' candy apple red 
 Scarlet gave him twenty seven stitches in his head 
 With a pint of green chartreuse ain't nothin' seems right 
 You buy the Sunday paper on a Saturday night 
 Can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch 
 I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch 
 Someone tell those Chinamen on Telegraph Canyon Road 
 When you're on the bill with the spoon there ain't no time to unload 
 So bye bye, baby, baby bye bye 
 Droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado 
 We're laughin' as they piled into Olmos' El Dorado 
 Jesus whispered eni meany miney moe 
 They're too proud to duck their heads 
 That's why they bring it down so low 
 So bye bye, baby, baby bye bye 
 The pointed man is smack dab in the middle of July 
 Swingin' from the rafters in his brand new tie 
 He said I can't go back to that hotel room, all they do is shout 
 Listen, I'll stay with you baby, 'til the money runs out 
 So bye bye, baby, baby bye bye 
 Bye bye baby, baby bye bye 
 Check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky 
 Splashin' bagdad on the hudson in panther martin's eyes 
 He's high and outside wearin' candy apple red

 With a pint of green chartreuse ain't nothin' seems right 
 You buy the Sunday paper on a Saturday night 
 Bye bye, baby, baby bye bye

 Bye bye, baby, baby bye bye 
 Bye bye, baby 
 Bye bye, baby, baby bye byeThe women all control their men with razors and with wrists 
 And the princess squeezes grape juice on a torrid, bloody kiss 
 What will you be wearing there, the lion or the raven hair? 
 The flesh will all be tearing but the tail will be my own 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 This one's for the balcony and this one's for the floor 
 As the senators decapitate the presidential whore 
 The bald headed senators are splashing in the blood 
 The dogs are having someone who is screaming in the mud 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 Now it's raining and it's pouring on the pillaging and goring 
 The constable is swinging from the chains 
 For the dead there is no story, no memory, no blame 
 Their families shout blue murder but tomorrow it's the same 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum, call 'em as we see 'em 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 A slowly acting poison will be given to the favorite one 
 The dark horse will bring glory to the jailer and his men 
 It's always much more sporting when there's families in the pit 
 And the madness of the crowd is an epileptic fit 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 No justice here, no liberty, no reason, no blame 
 There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood 
 And greetings from the nation as we shake the hands of time 
 They're taking their ovation, the vultures stay behind 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum tonight 
 In the colosseum tonightOh, take care of all of my children 
 Don't let them wander and roam 
 Oh, take care of all of my children 
 For I don't know when I'm coming home 
 You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name 
 Nail a sign on the door 
 Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane 
 I'm going up to see my Lord 
 Oh, keep them together at the sundown 
 Safe from the devil's hand 
 You got to make a pillow on the hard ground 
 I'll be goin' up to Beaula land 
 You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name 
 Nail a sign on the door 
 Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane 
 I'm going up to see my Lord 
 Remember you never trust the devil 
 Stay clear of Lucifer's hand 
 Don't let them wander in the meadow 
 Or you'll wind up in the frying pan 
 You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name 
 And nail a sign on the door 
 Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane 
 I'm going up to see my Lord 
 Put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name 
 Nail a sign on the door 
 Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane 
 I'm going up to see my LordWhen travelling abroad in the continental style 
 It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet 
 And subsequently bear in mind your transient position 
 Allows you a perspective that's unique 
 And though you'll find your itinerary's a blessing and a curse 
 Your wanderlust won't let you settle down 
 And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content 
 To stay within the city limits of a small Midwestern town 
 Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit 
 That remains the object of their long relentless quest 
 The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending 
 The pursuit you see and never the arrest 
 Without fear of contradiction, "bon voyage" is always hollered 
 In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore 
 By a girl that drives a rambler and furthermore is overly 
 Concerned that she won't see him anymore 
 Planes and trains and boats and buses 
 Characteristically evoke a commom attidude of blue 
 Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport 
 And the cargo that they're carrying is you 
 A foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside 
 And domestically approved romantic fancy 
 Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances knowing 
 It will only be parlayed into a memoryWell you play that Tarantella, all the hounds will start to roar 
 The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor 
 They drive along the pipeline, they tango till they're sore 
 They take apart their nightmares and they leave 'em by the door 
 Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair 
 Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs 
 I'll tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past 
 And send me off to bed forevermore 
 Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do 
 Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews 
 Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum that let me down 
 Put my clarinet beneath your bed till I get back in town 
 Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair 
 Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs 
 I'll tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past 
 So send me off to bed forevermore 
 Just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll 
 Leave the flag on Cadillac, they ain't a skillet on the wall 
 Cut me a switch, oh, hold your breath till the sun goes down 
 Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town 
 Then just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair 
 Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs 
 Tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past 
 Will you send me off to bed forevermore? 
 Fall out of the window with confetti in my hair 
 Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs 
 I'll tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past 
 Send me off to bed forevermore 
 Send me off to bed forevermore 
 Send me off to bed forevermoreI plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 And a black crow snuck through a hole in the sky 
 So I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule 
 And I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba 
 Now I leaned it up against a dandelion tree 
 Leaned it up against a dandelion tree 
 Leaned it up against a dandelion tree 
 I'm gonna cook those feathers on a tiny spit 
 Now I filled me a sachel full of old pig corn 
 And I beat me a billy from an old French horn 
 And I kicked that mule to the top of the tree 
 Kicked that mule to the top of the tree 
 And I blew me a hole about the size of a kickdrum 
 Now I cut me a switch from a long branch elbow 
 I'm gonna whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 Whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 Well I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed 
 Now I tore out the buckets from a red Corvette 
 Tore out the bucket from a red Corvette 
 Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three 
 You got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree 
 With the strings of a Washburn stretched like a clothes line 
 You know, me and that mule scrambled right through the hole 
 Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole 
 I'm gonna whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 Whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 Now I hold him prisoner in a Washburn jail 
 That I strapped on the back of my old kick mule 
 Strapped it on the back of my old kick mule 
 Bang on the strings just to drive him crazy 
 I strum it loud to rattle his cage 
 Strum it loud just to rattle his cage 
 Strum it loud just to rattle his cage 
 Strum it loud just to rattle his cage 
 I'm gonna whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six 
 Whittle you into kindling 
 Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six(Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan-Waits) 
 You must have brought the bad weather with you 
 The sky's the colour of lead 
 All you left me was a feather 
 On an unmade bed 
 It's always me whenever there's trouble 
 The world does nothing but turn 
 And the ring, it fell off my finger 
 I guess I'll never learn 
 But it's over, it's over, it's over 
 I'm getting dressed in the dark 
 Our story ends before it begins 
 I always confess to everyone's sins 
 The nail gets hammered down 
 And it's over, let it go 
 So don't go and make a big deal out of nothing 
 Well it's just a storm on a dime 
 And I've always found thar's nothing 
 That money can't buy 
 I've already gone to the place I'm going 
 There's no place left to fall 
 And there's something to be said for saying nothing at all 
 And it's over, it's over, it's over 
 It's done, forgotten and through 
 No one cares what it's all for 
 You'll be buried in the clothes that you never wore 
 So keep your suitcase by the door 
 It's over, let it go 
 But it's over, it's over, it's over 
 I'm getting dressed in the dark 
 Our story ends before it begins 
 I always confess to everyone's sins 
 The nail gets hammered down 
 And it's over, let it goWell it's hotter 'n' blazes and all the long faces 
 There'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier 
 There'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo 
 From Melbourne to Adelaide on the overlander 
 The train stopped in Serviceton less and less often 
 There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer 
 VicRail decided the canteen was no longer necessary 
 There no spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals 
 And the high noon sun beats a hundred and four 
 There's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe store 
 This tiny Victorian rhubarb 
 Kept the watering hole open for sixty five years 
 Now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st 
 Wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse 
 The train smokes down the xylophone 
 There'll be no stopping here 
 All ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer 
 No Bourbon, no Branchwater 
 Though the townspeople here 
 Fought the Vic Rail decree tooth and nail 
 Now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st 
 Wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse 
 The train smokes down the xylophone 
 There'll be no stopping here 
 All ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheerLeichenfleisch... Rübenbär... Lailando

 KommienezuspadtYoung Abdel Madi Shabneh 
 Was only eighteen years old 
 He was the youngest of nine children 
 He'd never spent a night away from home 
 And his mother held his photograph 
 Up in the New York Times 
 You see, the killing has intensified 
 Along the road to peace 
 He was a tall, thin boy with a wispy mustache 
 Disguised as an Orthodox Jew 
 On a crowded bus in Jerusalem 
 Some had survived World War II 
 And the thunderous explosion 
 Blew out windows two hundred yards away 
 With more retribution and seventeen dead 
 Along the Road to Peace 
 Now at King George Ave and 
 Jaffa Road 
 Passengers boarded bus 14A 
 In the aisle 
 Next to the driver 
 Abdel Madi Shabneh 
 And the last thing that he said on earth 
 Is, "God is great and God is good" 
 And he blew them all to kingdom come 
 Upon the Road to Peace 
 In response to this 
 Another kiss 
 Of death was visited upon 
 Yashir Tehah, Israel says, is an Hamas senior militant 
 And Israel sent 4 choppers in 
 Flames engulfed his white Opel 
 And it killed his wife and his 3-year-old child 
 Leaving only blackened skeletons 
 They found his toddler's bottle and a pair of small shoes 
 And they waved them in front of the cameras 
 But Israel says 
 They did not know that his wife and child were in the car 
 There are roadblocks everywhere 
 And only suffering on TV 
 Neither side will ever give up 
 Their smallest right 
 Along the Road to Peace 
 Israel launched its latest campaign 
 Against Hamas on Tuesday 
 And two days later Hamas shot back 
 And killed five Israeli soldiers 
 Though thousands dead and wounded on both sides 
 Most have been Middle Eastern civilians 
 They fill their children full of hate 
 To fight an old man's war 
 And die upon the Road to Peace 
 Now, "This is our land 
 We will fight with all our force" 
 Say the Palestinians and the Jews 
 And each side will cut off the hand of anyone 
 Who tries to stop the Resistance 
 "If thy right eye offends thee 
 Then you must pluck it out" 
 And Mahmoud Abbas and Sharon have been lost 
 Out along the Road to Peace 
 Once Kissinger said "We have no friends 
 America only has interests" 
 And now our president wants 
 To be seen as a hero 
 And he's hungry for re-election 
 But Bush is reluctant to risk his future 
 And the fear of his political failure 
 So he plays chess at his desk 
 And poses for the press 
 Ten thousand miles from the Road to Peace 
 In a video 
 That they found at the home 
 Of Abdel Madi Shabneh 
 He held a Kalashnikov rifle 
 And he spoke with a voice like a boy 
 He was an excellent student 
 He studied so hard 
 It was as if he had a future 
 He told his mother that he 
 Had a test that day 
 Out along the Road to Peace 
 The fundamentalists killing 
 On both sides 
 Are standing in the path of peace 
 But tell me why are we arming the Israeli Army 
 With guns and tanks and bullets? 
 And if God is great 
 And God is good 
 Why can't he change the hearts of men? 
 Well, maybe God Himself is lost and needs help 
 Maybe God Himself, He needs all of our help 
 Maybe God Himself is lost and needs help 
 He's out upon the road to peace 
 Maybe God Himself is lost and needs help 
 Maybe God Himself needs all of our help 
 And He's lost upon the Road to Peace 
 He's lost upon the Road to Peace 
 Out upon the Road to PeaceCome with me my love to the sea 
 The sea of love 
 I want to tell you 
 How much I love you 
 I'm drowning in a sea of love 
 Do you remember the night we met? 
 That's the night I knew you were my pet 
 I want to tell you 
 How much I love you 
 I'm drowning in a sea of love 
 Come with me to the sea 
 Do you remember the night we met? 
 That's the night I just knew you were my pet 
 I want to tell you 
 How much I love you 
 I'm down in a sea of love 
 Come with me to the sea 
 Do you remember the night we met? 
 That's the night I just knew you were my pet 
 I want to tell you 
 How much I love you 
 I'm down in a sea of love 
 Come with me to the sea 
 Do you remember the night we met? 
 That's the night I just knew you were my pet

 The sea of love 
 I want to tell you 
 How much I love you 
 I'm down here in a sea of love 
 Come with me to the seaOver here 
 The ladies all want sweet perfume 
 But there's never a rose 
 And over there 
 The roses are frightened to bloom 
 So they never can grow 
 And over here they need wool 
 For weaving their baby's new clothes 
 But nobody has any wool 
 And the sheep are all lost in the harbour 
 Lost in the harbour 
 And over here 
 They want diamonds to wear 
 But there aren't any here 
 And over there 
 Everyone's hiding their tears 
 But they're crying inside 
 And the wall won't come down 
 Till they're no longer afraid of themselves 
 If you don't believe me ask yourselves 
 And then I can come down to the harbour 
 Down to the harbour 
 And then I will fill the ocean back up with my tears 
 I still have a couple more years 
 And then I can come back to the harbour 
 Down to the harbourThe prettiest girl in all the world 
 Is in a little Spanish town 
 But I left her for a bonnie lass 
 And I told her I'd see her around 
 But that bonnie lass and her heart of glass 
 Would not hold a candle to bumming around 
 So don't cry for me 'cause I'm going away 
 And I'll be back some lucky day 
 Well, tell the boys back home 
 That I'm doing just fine 
 I left all my troubles and woe 
 So sing about me, for I can't come home 
 I've many, many, many more miles to go 
 Why, there's Miss Kelsey, she taught dance at our school 
 And old Johnny O'Toole, I'll still beat you at pool 
 So don't cry for me, for I'm going away 
 And I'll be back some lucky day 
 Now when I was a boy my daddy sat me on his knee 
 And he told me, he told me many things 
 And he said, "son, There's a lot of things in this world 
 You're gonna have no use for 
 And when you get blue and you've lost all your dreams 
 There's nothin' like a campfire and a can of beans" 
 Why, there's Miss Kelsey, she taught dance at our school 
 And old Johnny O'Toole, I'll still beat you at pool 
 So don't cry for me, for I'm going away 
 And I'll be back some lucky day 
 So don't cry for me, for I'm going away 
 And I'll be back some lucky dayBartender, I'd like a manhattan please 
 Stop me if you've heard this one 
 I feel as though we've met before 
 Perhaps I'm mistaken 
 But it's just that I remind you 
 Of someone you used to care about 
 Oh, but that was long ago 
 Now tell me, do you think I'd fall for that old line 
 I was not born yesterday 
 Besides I never talk to strangers anyway 
 I ain't a bad guy when you get to know me 
 I just thought there ain't no harm 
 Hey, just try minding your own business, bud 
 Who asked you to annoy me 
 With your sad, sad repartee? 
 Besides I never talk to strangers anyway 
 Your life's a dimestore novel (oh, baby) 
 This town is full of guys like you (ain't that cold) 
 And you're looking for someone 
 To take the place of her (you must be readin' my mail) 
 And you're bitter 'cause he left you 
 That's why you're drinkin' in this bar 
 Well, only suckers fall in love 
 With perfect strangers 
 It always takes one (I heard that) to know one stranger 
 Maybe we're just wiser now 
 And been around the block so many times 
 That we don't notice 
 That we're all just perfect strangers 
 As long as we ignore 
 That we all begin as strangers 
 Just before we find 
 We really aren't strangers anymore 
 Oh, you don't look like such a chumpYou can hang me in a bottle like a cat 
 Let the crows pick me clean but for my hat 
 Where the wailing of a baby 
 Meets the footsteps of the dead 
 We're all mad here 
 As the devil sticks his flag into the mud 
 Mrs. Carol has run off with Reverend Judd 
 Hell is such a lonely place 
 And your big expensive face will never last 
 And you'll die with the rose still on your lips 
 And in time the heart-shaped bone that was your hips 
 And the worms, they will climb the rugged ladder of your spine 
 We're all mad here 
 And my eyeballs roll this terrible terrain 
 And we're all inside a decomposing train 
 And your eyes will die like fish 
 And the shore of your face will turn to boneThe fire's dying out 
 All the embers have been spent 
 Outside on the street 
 Lovers hide in the shadows 
 You look at me 
 I look at you 
 There’s only one thing 
 I want you to do 
 Kiss me 
 I want you to kiss me 
 Like a stranger 
 Once again 
 Kiss me like a stranger once again 
 I want to believe that our love's a mystery 
 I want to believe that our love's a sin 
 I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again 
 You wear the same kind of perfume 
 You wore when we met 
 I suppose there's something comforting 
 In knowing what to expect 
 But when you brushed up against me 
 Before I knew your name 
 Everything was thrilling 
 'Cause nothing was the same 
 And I want you to kiss me 
 I want you to kiss me 
 Like a stranger once again 
 Kiss me like a stranger once again 
 I want to believe our love's a mystery 
 I want to believe our love's a sin 
 Oh, will you kiss me like a stranger once again 
 I want you to kiss me like a stranger 
 Kiss me like a stranger once againPeoria Johnson told Dudlow Joe 
 I can break out of any old jail you know 
 The bars are iron, the walls are stone 
 All I need me is an old fishbone 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Oh boy 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse 
 Fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Corbina, opaleye hammer head shark 
 Steel head salmon or a mud bank carp 
 Sand me one side dull, whittle the other side sharp 
 By Saturday night I'll be in Central Park 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Oh boy 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse 
 Fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Ask Little Son Jackson, or the 44 Kid 
 Ask Whitfield Faraday what I did 
 From Yazoo city up to Rollin' Fork 
 From Natchez to Kenosha, from New Dime to New York 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Oh boy 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 They're serving fish in the jailhouse 
 Fish in the jailhouse tonight 
 Gimme a nice totuava or a chicken of the sea 
 I'm gonna fashion me a fishbone skeleton key 
 Tell Skullion Childs I won't be late 
 You can bet your freedom 
 I'm gonna clean my plateMy head is a-spinning round 
 My heart is in my shoes, yeah 
 I went and set the Thames on fire 
 Now I must come back down 
 She's laughing in her sleeve, boys 
 I can feel it in my bones 
 Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head 
 I'm gonna call my home 
 Well I see that the world is upside-down 
 Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold 
 And now the clouds, well they've covered everything, oh 
 And the wind is blowing cold 
 Well I don't need anybody 
 Because I learned, I learned to be alone 
 Well I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys 
 Well I gonna call my homeWell I broke down in E. St. Louis 
 On the Kansas City line 
 And I drunk up all my money 
 That I borrowed every time 
 And I fell down at the derby 
 And now the night's black as a crow 
 It was a train that took me away from here 
 But a train can't bring me home 
 What made my dreams so hollow 
 Was standing at the depot 
 With a steeple full of swallows 
 That could never ring the bell 
 With not one thing to show 
 Well it was a train that took me away from here 
 But a train can't bring me home 
 I remember when I left 
 Without bothering to pack 
 You know I up and left with 
 Just the clothes I had on my back 
 Now I'm sorry for what I've done 
 And I'm out here on my own 
 Well it was a train that took me away from 
 Here but a train can't bring me homeI never saw the morning till I stayed up all night 
 I never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light 
 I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long 
 I never heard the melody until I needed the song 
 I never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind 
 I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind 
 I never spoke "I love you" till I cursed you in vain 
 I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane 
 I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west 
 I never saw the moonlight until it shone off your breast 
 I never saw your heart until someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away 
 I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face 
 I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night 
 I never saw the sunshine till you turned out your love light, baby 
 I never saw my hometown till I stayed away too long 
 I never heard the melody until I needed the songShe drove a big ol' Lincoln 
 With suicide doors and a sewing machine 
 In the back 
 And a light bulb that looked like 
 An alligator egg was mounted up front 
 In the hood 
 And she had an Easter bonnet that 
 Had been signed by Tennessee Ernie Ford 
 And she always had sawdust in her hair 
 And she cut two holes in the back of her dress 
 And she had these scapula wings 
 That were covered in feathers and 
 Electrical tape 
 And when she got good and drunk she 
 Would sing about Elkheart Indiana 
 Where the wind is strong and folks 
 Mind their own business 
 And she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
 That she'd taken from kids and she 
 Collected bones of all kinds and she 
 Lived in a trailer under a bridge and 
 She made her own whiskey and gave 
 Cigarettes to kids and she'd been 
 Struck by lightning seven or eight times 
 And she hated the mention of rain 
 And she made up her own language and 
 She wore rubber boots and she could 
 Fix anything with string and her lips were 
 Like cherries and she was stronger than 
 Any man and she smelled like gasoline 
 And root beer fizz and she put 
 Mud on a bee sting I got at the 
 Creek and she gave me my very 
 First kiss 
 And she gave me my very first kiss 
 Talking 'bout my little Kathleen 
 She's just a fine young thing 
 Someday she'll wear my ring 
 My little KathleenWell, I don't mind working 
 ‘Cause I used to be jerkin off 
 Most of my time in the bars 
 I been a cabby and a stock clerk 
 And a soda fountain jock jerk 
 And a manic mechanic on cars 
 It's nice work if you can get it 
 Now who the hell said it? 
 I got money to spend on my girl 
 But the work never stops 
 And I'll be busting my chops 
 Working for Joe and Sal 
 And I can't wait to get off work and see my baby 
 She said she'd leave the porch light on for me 
 I'm disheveled, I'm disdainful 
 And I'm distracted and it's painful 
 But this job sweeping up here is 
 Is gainfully employing me tonight 
 Tom do this, Tom do that 
 Tom, don't do that 
 Count the cash, clean the oven 
 Dump the trash, oh your lovin' 
 Is a rare and a copacetic gift 
 I'm a moonlight watchmanic 
 It's hard to be romantic 
 Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine 
 Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine 
 I can't wait to get off work and see my baby 
 She'll be waiting up with a magazine for me 
 Clean the bathrooms and clean 'em good 
 Oh, you're lovin', I wish you would 
 Come down here and sweep-a me off my feet 
 This broom'll have to be my baby 
 If I hurry I just might 
 Get off before the dawns early lightPut a dead cat on the railroad tracks 
 When the wolfbane's blooming by the tressell 
 Get the eyeball of a rooster 
 Stones from a ditch 
 Wash 'em down with bilge water 
 Say you'll never snitch 
 Take the buttons from a yellow jacket 
 Feather from a buzzard 
 Blood from a bounty hunters cold black heart 
 Catch the tears of a widow 
 In a thimble made of glass 
 Tell your mama and your papa 
 They can kiss your ass 
 Poison all the water in the wishin' well 
 Hang all them scarecrows from a sycamore tree 
 Burn down them honeymoons 
 Put 'em in a pillow case 
 Wait next to the switch blades at the amusement park for me 
 Strangle all the Christmas carols 
 Scratch out all the prayers 
 Tie 'em up with barbed wire 
 And push them down the stairs 
 I'll whittle you a pistol 
 Keepin' nightmares off your blinds 
 Them sonsabitches always seem to sneak up from behind 
 Syphon all the gas from your daddy's pickup truck 
 Fill up Jonny's T-Bird 
 I got a couple bucks 
 Put on little perfume and ribbon in your hair 
 Careful that you don't wake up the hounds 
 Tear a bolt of lightning 
 Off the side of the sky 
 Throw her in the cedar chest 
 If you want me to tell you why 
 Bring the gear shift knob from a 49 Merc 
 Lie down here beside me 
 Let me hold you in the dirt 
 You're gonna tremble 
 Tear the throat out of the night 
 Sink your teeth into my shoulder 
 Dig your nails into my back 
 Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve 
 You'll be a woman when I catch you 
 C'mon baby, fall in love with me 
 With my double barrel shotgun 
 And a whole box of shells 
 We'll celebrate the 4 of July 
 We'll do 100mph 
 Spendin' someone else's dough 
 Drive all the way to Reno 
 On the wrong side of the road 
 The wrong side of the road 
 On the wrong side of the road 
 Wrong side of the road 
 Wrong side of the road 
 Wrong side of the roadWhen I'm lying in my bed at night 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Nothing ever seems to turn out right 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 How do you move in a world of fog 
 That's always changing things? 
 Makes me wish that I could be a dog 
 When I see the price that you pay 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 I don't ever wanna be that way 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Seems like folks turn into things 
 That they'd never want 
 The only thing to live for is today 
 I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Open up the medicine chest 
 And I don't wanna grow up 
 I don't wanna have to shout it out, I don't want my hair to fall out 
 I don't wanna be filled with doubt, I don't wanna be a good boy scout 
 I don't wanna have to learn to count, I don't wanna have the biggest amount 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Well when I see my parents fight 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 They all go out and drinking all night 
 And I don't wanna grow up 
 I'd rather stay here in my room 
 Nothing out there but sad and gloom 
 I don't wanna live in a big old tomb on Grand Street 
 When I see the 5 o'clock news 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Comb their hair and shine their shoes 
 I don't wanna grow up 
 Stay around in my old hometown, I don't wanna put no money down 
 I don't wanna get me a big old loan, work them fingers to the bone 
 I don't wanna float a broom, fall in love and get married, then boom 
 How the hell did it get here so soon? 
 I don't wanna grow upWell I woke up this morning 
 With the cold water, 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold water 
 Woke up this morning 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold 
 Police at the station 
 And they don't look friendly 
 Well they don't look friendly 
 Well they don't look friendly 
 Police at the station 
 And they don't look friendly 
 Well, They don't look friendly 
 Well They don't 
 Blind or crippled 
 Sharp or dull 
 I'm reading the Bible 
 By a 40 watt bulb 
 What price freedom 
 Dirt is my rug 
 Well I sleep like a baby 
 With the snakes and the bugs 
 Well the stores are open 
 But I ain't got no money 
 I ain't got no money 
 I ain't got no money 
 Stores are open but I 
 Ain't got no money 
 Ain't got no money 
 Well I ain't 
 Found an old dog 
 And he seems to like me 
 Seems to like me 
 Well he seems to like me 
 Found an old dog and he 
 Seems to like me 
 Seems to like me 
 Well he seems 
 Seen them fellows 
 With the card board signs 
 Scrapin up a little money 
 To buy a bottle of wine 
 Pregnant women and 
 The Vietnam vets I say 
 Beggin on the freeway 
 Bout as hard as it gets 
 Well I slept in the graveyard 
 It was cool and still 
 Cool and still 
 It was cool and still 
 Slept in the graveyard 
 It was cool and still 
 Cool and still and it 
 Was cool 
 Slept all night in the Cedar grove 
 I was born to ramble 
 Born to rove 
 Some men are searchin' for the 
 Holy Grail 
 But there ain't nothin' sweeter 
 Than ridin' the rails 
 I LOOK 47 but I'm 24 
 Well they shooed me away 
 From here the time before 
 Turned there their backs 
 And they locked their doors 
 I'm watching TV in 
 The window of a furniture store 
 And I woke up this morning 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold water 
 Woke up this morning 
 With the cold water 
 With the cold water 
 With the coldWell with buck shot eyes and a purple heart 
 I rolled down the national stroll 
 And with a big fat paycheck 
 Strapped to my hip sack 
 And a shore leave wristwatch underneath 
 My sleeve 
 In a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels 
 I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank 
 And I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga 
 And was in a bad need of a shave 
 And so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein 
 And shot billards with a midget 
 Until the rain stopped 
 And I bought a long sleeved shirt 
 With horses on the front 
 And some gum and a lighter and a knife 
 And a new deck of cards (with girls on the back) 
 And I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife 
 And I said Baby, I'm so far away from home 
 And I miss my Baby so 
 I can't make it by myself 
 I love you so 
 Well I was pacing myself 
 Trying to make it all last 
 Squeezing all the life 
 Out of a lousy two day pass 
 And I had a cold one at the Dragon 
 With some Filipino floor show 
 And talked baseball with a lieutenant 
 Over a Singapore sling 
 And I wondered how the same moon outside 
 Over this Chinatown fair 
 Could look down on Illinois 
 And find you there 
 And you know I love you Baby 
 And I'm so far away from home 
 And I miss my Baby so 
 I can't make it by myself 
 I love you so 
 Shore Leave... 
 Shore Leave...The smart money's on Harlow and the moon is in the street 
 The shadow boys are breaking all the laws 
 And you're east of East St. Louis and the wind is making speeches 
 And the rain sounds like a round of applause 
 Napoleon is weeping in the Carnival saloon 
 His invisible fiancee is in the mirror 
 And the band is going home, it's raining hammers, it's raining nails 
 It's true, there's nothing left for him down here 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time that you love 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And they all pretend they're orphans and their memory's like a train 
 You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away 
 And the things you can't remember tell the things you can't forget 
 That history puts a saint in every dream 
 Well, she said she'd stick around until the bandages came off 
 But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit 
 And Matilda asks the sailors are those dreams or are those prayers 
 So close your eyes, son, and this won't hurt a bit 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time that you love 
 And it's time, time, time 
 Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl 
 The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street 
 And when they're on a roll she pulls a razor from her boot 
 And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet 
 So put a candle in the window and a kiss upon his lips 
 As the dish outside the window fills with rain 
 Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart 
 And pay the fiddler off till I come back again 
 Oh, it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time that you love 
 And it's time, time, time 
 Oh, it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time 
 And it's time, time, time that you love 
 And it's time, time, timeThe flash pan hunter sways with the wind 
 And his rifle is the sound of the morning 
 Each sulfurous bullet way have it's own wit 
 Each cartridge comes with a warning 
 Beware of elaborate telescopic meat 
 It will find its way back to the forest 
 For Willem can't wait 
 To be Peg Leg's crown 
 As the briar is strangling 
 The rose back down 
 His back shall be my slender new branch 
 It will bend, it will sway in the breeze 
 As the devil does his polka 
 With a hatchet in his hand 
 As a sniper in the branches of the trees 
 The vulture flutters down

 Try and pull ol' frankie down 
 Live for tomorrow I have found you

 I'm going straight up to the top oh yeah 
 Up where the air is fresh and cleanOn our anniversary 
 There'll be someone else where you used to be 
 The world don't care and yet it clings to me 
 And the moon is gold and silvery 
 Who knows where the sidewalk ends 
 Well, the road will turn and the road will bend 
 They always say he marks the sparrow's fall 
 How can anyone believe it all? 
 Well, the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing 
 The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning 
 On his hand he wore the ring of another 
 And the world keeps turning, the world keeps turning 
 We broke the bank and we tore up the place 
 And we disappeared oh without a trace 
 Now the sun it falls into the sea 
 And around the only one for me 
 I was so green and the dress you wore was yellow 
 And the world keeps turning, the world keeps turning 
 The sun is down and the moon is in the meadow 
 And the world keeps turning, the world keeps turning 
 Put a hat on your head 
 Will you paint the whole damned town red with me? 
 Well, the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing 
 The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning 
 On his hand he wore the ring of another

 I said: don't go into that barn, yeah 
 Black cellophane sky at midnight 
 A big blue moon with three gold rings 
 I called Champion to the window 
 I pointed up above the trees 
 That's where I heard my name in a scream 
 Coming from the woods, out there 
 I let my dog run off the chain 
 I locked my door real good with a chair 
 Don't go into that barn, yeah 
 I said: don't go into that barn, yeah 
 Everett Lee broke loose again, 
 It's worse than the time before 
 Because he's high on potato and tulip wine 
 Fermented in the muddy rain, of course 
 A drunken wail, a drunken train 
 Blew through the birdless trees 
 Oh, you're alone all right 
 You're alone all right 
 How did I know 
 How did I know 
 Don't go into that barn, yeah 
 I said: don't go into that barn, yeah 
 An old black tree, scratching up the sky 
 With boney, claw like fingers 
 A rusty black rake 
 Digging up the turnips of a muddy cold grey sky 
 Shiny tooth talons 
 Coiled for grabbing a stranger happening by 
 And the day went home early 
 And the sun sank down into the muck of a deep dead sky 
 Don't go into that barn, yeah 
 I said: don't go into that barn, yeah 
 Back since Saginaw Calinda was born, 
 It's been cotton and soyabeans, tobacco and corn 
 Behind the porticoed house of a long dead farm 
 They found the falling down timbers 
 Of a spooky old barn 
 Out there like a slave ship upside down 
 Wrecked beneath the waves of grain 
 When the river is low 
 They find old bones and 
 When they plow they always dig up chains 
 Don't go into that barn, yeah 
 I said: don't go into that barn, yeah 
 Did you bury your fire? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you cover your tracks? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you bring your knife? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did they see your face? 
 No sir! 
 Did the moon see you? 
 No sir! 
 Did you go cross the river? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you fix your rake? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you stay down wind? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you hide your gun? 
 Yes sir! 
 Did you smuggle your rum? 
 Yes sir!

 Has punched a hole in the nighttime mist 
 I climb through the window and down to the street 
 I'm shining like a new dime 
 The downtown trains are full 
 With all of those Brooklyn girls 
 They try so hard 
 To break out of their little worlds 
 Well, you wave your hand and they scatter like crows 
 They have nothing that will ever capture your heart 
 They're just thorns without the rose 
 Be careful of them in the dark 
 Oh, if I was the one 
 You chose to be your only one 
 Oh baby, can't you hear me now? 
 Can't you hear me now? 
 Will I see you tonight 
 On a downtown train? 
 Every night it's just the same 
 You leave me lonely now 
 I know your window and I know it's late 
 I know your stairs and your doorway 
 I walk down your street and past your gate 
 I stand by the light at the four-way 
 You watch them as they fall 
 Oh baby, they all have heart attacks 
 They stay at the carnival 
 But they'll never win you back 
 Will I see you tonight 
 On a downtown train? 
 Every night, every night is just the same 
 Oh baby 
 Will I see you tonight 
 On a downtown train? 
 All of my dreams, they fall like rain 
 Oh baby, on a downtown train

 You can be sure that I will never 
 Stop believing 
 The blushing rose will climb 
 Spring ahead or fall behind 
 Winter dreams the same dream every time 
 You can never hold back spring 
 Even though you've lost your way 
 The world keeps dreaming of spring 
 So, close your eyes open your heart 
 To the one who's dreaming of you 
 But you can never hold back spring

 Same kind of bad as meWell, pale face said to the eyeball kid 
 She just goes clank and boom and steam 
 A halo, wings, horns and a tail 
 Shoveling coal inside my dreams 
 There are no laws 
 She's made of cream 
 She's such a scream 
 Qui bon tres bien, nails in the cement 
 A Donnie gal from mortal clay 
 The plow is red, the well is full 
 Inside the dollhouse of her skull 
 A cheetah coat 
 Fills up with steam 
 She's such a scream 
 All crooked lines, her fireplace 
 A milktrain so clean, machine gun haste 
 You'll ride the only wall of shame 
 And drag that chain across the state 
 Her lips are red 
 She is the queen 
 She's such a screamI got the style but not the grace 
 I got the clothes but not the face 
 I got the bread but not the butter 
 I got the window but not the shutter 
 But I'm big in Japan 
 I'm big in Japan 
 Hey but I'm big in Japan 
 I'm big in Japan 
 I got the house but not the deed 
 I got the horn but not the reed 
 I got the cards but not the luck 
 I got the wheel but not the truck 
 But hey I'm big in Japan 
 I'm big in Japan 
 I'm big in Japan 
 I'm big in Japan 
 I got the moon 
 I got the cheese 
 I got the whole damn nation on its knees

 Hey-oh! 
 There's really nothing to it

 There's a husband in 
 The dog house 
 In the middle of a shakedown 
 She got 
 Quiet as a church mouose 
 She found Raleigh's on 
 The dashboard 
 Sugar daddy caught a polocar 
 Ain't no solitary 
 Tap dance way down here 
 I swear I's riding 
 On a field mouse 
 We were dancin' in the slaughterhouse 
 If you swing along the beltway 
 Then you skid along the all day 
 'Cause I went a little crazy 
 And I sat upon a high chair 
 And I'm smokin' like a diesel 
 Way out here 
 Blow wind blow - blow me away here - 
 Blow wind blow (repeat)There's a house on my block 
 That's abandoned and cold 
 Folks moved out of it a 
 Long time ago 
 And they took all their things 
 And they never came back 
 Looks like it's haunted 
 With the windows all cracked 
 And everyone call it 
 The house, the house where 
 Nobody lives 
 Once it held laughter 
 Once it held dreams 
 Did they throw it away 
 Did they know what it means 
 Did someone's heart break 
 Or did someone do somebody wrong? 
 Well the paint was all cracked 
 It was peeled off of the wood 
 Papers were stacked on the porch 
 Where I stood 
 And the weeds had grown up 
 Just as high as the door 
 There were birds in the chimney 
 And an old chest of drawers 
 Looks like no one will ever 
 Come back to the 
 House were nobody lives 
 Once it held laughter 
 Once it held dreams 
 Did they throw it away 
 Did they know what it means 
 Did someone's heart break 
 Or did someone do someone wrong? 
 So if you find someone 
 Someone to have, someone to hold 
 Don't trade it for silver 
 Don't trade it for gold 
 I have all of life's treasures 
 And they are fine and they are good 
 They remind me that houses 
 Are just made of wood 
 What makes a house grand 
 Ain't the roof or the doors 
 If there's love in a house 
 It's a palace for sure 
 Without love... 
 It ain't nothin' but a house 
 A house where nobody lives 
 Without love it ain't nothin' 
 But a house, a house where 
 Nobody lives.If you want money in your pocket 
 You want a top hat on your head 
 Hot meal on your table 
 And a blanket on your bed, 
 Well today is grey skies, 
 Tomorrow is tears, 
 You'll have to wait 
 Till yesterday is here. 
 I'm a going to New York City 
 I'll be leaving on a train 
 If you wanna see me 
 Till I come back again, 
 Well today is grey skies 
 Tomorrow is tears, 
 You'll have to wait till 
 Yesterday is here. 
 Now if wanna go 
 Where the rainbows end 
 You will have to say goodbye. 
 All our dreams come true 
 Baby up ahead, 
 In a town where your memories lie. 
 Now the road is out before me 
 And the moon is shining bright 
 What I want you to remember 
 As I disappear tonight 
 That today is grey skies 
 Tomorrow is tears 
 You'll have to wait till 
 Yesterday is here.(Tom Waits/ Kathleen Brennan) 
 The sky holds all our wishes 
 The dish ran away 
 With the spoon 
 The chimney smoke 
 Ties the roofs 
 To the sky 
 There's a hole over head 
 But it's only the moon 
 Will there ever be a tree 
 Grown from the seeds I've sown 
 Life is a path lit only 
 By the light of those I've loveSun is red; moon is cracked 
 Daddy's never coming back 
 Nothing's ever yours to keep 
 Close your eyes, go to sleep 
 If I die before I wake 
 Don't you cry don't you weep 
 Nothing's ever as it seems 
 Climb the ladder to your dreams 
 If I die before you wake 
 Don't you cry; don't you weep 
 Nothing's ever yours to keep 
 Close your eyes; go to sleepWell, I'm a jitterbug boy 
 By the shoeshine 
 Resting on my Laurels and my Hardys too 
 Life of Riley on a swing shift 
 Gears follow my drift 
 Once upon a time I was in showbiz too 
 I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers 
 Playin' at Ebbets Field 
 Seen a Kentucky Derby too 
 It's fast women, slow horses 
 I'm reliable sources 
 And I'm holding up the lamp post if you want to know 
 I seen the Wabash Cannonball 
 Buddy, I've done it all 
 'Cause I slept with the lions 
 And Marilyn Monroe 
 Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane 
 Fought Rocky Marciano 
 Played Minnesota Fats 
 Burned hundred-dollar bills 
 I eaten mulligan stew 
 Got drunk with Louis Armstrong 
 What's that old song? 
 I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows 
 And so you ask me what I'm doing here 
 Holding up a lamp post 
 Flippin' this quarter, trying to make up my mind 
 And if it's heads I'll go to Tennessee 
 Tails I'll buy a drink 
 If it lands on the edge I keep talking to youThere is a light in the forest 
 There is a face in the tree 
 I'll pull you out of the chorus 
 And the first one's always free 
 You can never go hunting 
 With just a flintlock and a hound 
 You won't go home with a bunting 
 If you blow a hundred rounds 
 It takes much more than wild courage 
 Or you'll hit just the tattered clouds 
 You must have just the right bullets 
 And the first one's always free 
 You must be careful in the forest 
 Broken glass and rusty nails 
 If you're to bring back something for us 
 I have bullets for sale 
 Why be a fool when you can chase away 
 Your blind and your gloom 
 I have blessed each one of these bullets 
 And they shine just like a spoon 
 To have sixty silver wishes 
 Is a small price to pay 
 They'll be your private little fishes 
 And they'll never swim away 
 I just want you to be happy 
 That's my only wish 
 I'll fix your wagon and your musket 
 And the spoon will have his dish 
 And I shudder at the thought of your 
 Poor empty hunter's pouch 
 So I'll keep the wind from your barrel 
 And bless the roof of your houseI'm going straight to the top 
 Oh yeah up where the air is fresh and clean 
 I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah 
 If you know me, you know what I mean 
 I can't let sorrow pull ol' Frankie down 
 Live for tomorrow I have found you 
 I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah 
 Up where the air is fresh and clean 
 I just know that I will never stop, oh no 
 Until I know I'm wild and free 
 I'm like a champagne bubble pop pop pop 
 I'm like those birdies high up in the trees 
 I can't let sorrow pull ol' Frankie down 
 Live for tomorrow I have found you out 
 I'm going straight up to the top oh yeah 
 Up where the air is fresh and clean, yeah 
 I can't let sorrow pull ol' Frankie down 
 Live for tomorrow I have found you 
 I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah 
 Up where the air is, up where the air is 
 Up where the air is up, where the air is 
 Up where the air is fresh and cleanLonely, lonely, lonely 
 Lonely eyes, lonely face 
 Lonely, lonely in your place, lonely 
 Lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face 
 Lonely, lonely in your place 
 I thought that I knew 
 All that there was to 
 Lonely, lonely, lonely 
 Melanie Jane 
 Won't feel the pain 
 Lonely, lonely 
 Lonely eyes, lonely face 
 Lonely, lonely in your place 
 And I thought that I knew 
 All that there was to 
 Lonely, lonely 
 Lonely eyes, lonely face 
 Lonely, lonely in your place 
 And I still love you 
 I still love you 
 Lonely, lonelyThe gigolo's jumpin salty 
 Ain't no trade out on the streets 
 Half past the unlucky 
 And the hawk's a front-row seat 
 Dressed in full orchestration 
 Stage door Johnny’s got to pay 
 And sent him home 
 Talking about the one that got away 
 Could've been on easy street 
 Could've been a wheel 
 With irons in the fire 
 And all them business deals 
 But the last of the big-time losers 
 Shouted before he drove away 
 "I'll be right back as soon as I crack 
 The one that got away" 
 The ambulance drivers, they don't give a shit 
 They just want to get off work 
 And the short stop and the victim 
 Already gone berserk 
 And the shroud-tailor measures him 
 For a deep-six holiday 
 The stiff is froze, the case is closed 
 On the one that got away 
 Jim Crow's directing traffic 
 With them cemetery blues 
 With them peculiar looking trousers 
 Them old Italian shoes 
 And the wooden kimona was all ready 
 To drop in San Francisco Bay 
 But he's mumbling something 
 All about the one that got away 
 Costello was the champion 
 At the St. Moritz Hotel 
 And the best this side of Fairfax 
 Reliable sources tell 
 But his reputation is at large 
 And he's at Ben Frank's every day 
 Waiting for the one that got away 
 He's got a snakeskin sport shirt 
 And he looks like Vincent Price 
 With a little piece of chicken 
 And he's carving off a slice 
 But someone tipped her off 
 She'll be doing a Houdini now, anyday 
 She shook his hustle and a Greyhound bus'll 
 Take the one that got away 
 Andre is at the piano 
 Behind the Ivar in the sewers 
 With a buck a shot for pop tunes 
 And a fin for guided tours 
 He could’ve been in Casablanca 
 He stood in line out there all day 
 But now he's spilling whiskey 
 And learning songs about a one that got away 
 Well, I've lost my equilibrium 
 My car keys and my pride 
 The tattoo parlour's warm 
 And so I huddle there inside 
 And the grinding of the buzz saw 
 "Whatchu want that thing to say?" 
 Just don't misspell her name 
 Buddy, she's the one that got awayIt's too early for the circus 
 It's too late for the bars 
 Everyone's sleepin' but the paperboys 
 And no one in this town is makin' any noise 
 But the dogs and the milkmen and me 
 The girls around here all look like Cadillacs 
 No one likes a stranger here 
 I'd come home but I'm afraid that you won't take me back 
 But I'd trade off everything just to have you near 
 I know I'm irresponsible and I don't behave 
 And I ruin everything that I do 
 I'll probably get arrested when I'm in my grave 
 But I'll be saving all my love for you 
 I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute 
 With too much makeup and a broken shoe 
 But her eyes were just a counterfeit 
 She tried to gyp me out of it 
 But you know that I am still in love with you 
 Don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me 
 'Cause I ain't as bad as they make me out to be 
 Well I may lose my mind, but baby can't you see 
 That I'll be saving all my love for youIrene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight 
 Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene. 
 I'll see you in my dreams. 
 Last Saturday night I got married. 
 Me and my wife settled down. 
 Now, me and my wife are parted. 
 Gonna take a little stroll downtown. 
 Yeah, sometimes I live in the country 
 And sometimes I live in town. 
 Yeah, and sometimes I take a great notion 
 I'm gonna jump in the river and drown. 
 Stop ramblin'. Stop that gamblin'. 
 Stop staying out late at night. 
 Go home to your wife and family. 
 Stay there by the fireside, bright. 
 Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene. 
 I'll see you in my dreams.A cab combs the snake tryin' 
 To rake in that last night's fare 
 And a solitary sailor 
 Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers 
 Paws his inside Pea coat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents 
 And the last bent butt from a package of Kents 
 As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes 
 And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair 
 Her rhinestone-studded moniker says, "Irene" 
 As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes 
 And the Texaco beacon burns on 
 The steel-belted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special' 
 Cryin' "Fill'er up and check that oil" 
 "You know it could be the distributor and it could be your coil." 
 The early mornin' final edition's on the stands 
 And the town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands 
 Pigs in a blanket, sixty-nine cents 
 Eggs-roll 'em over and a package of Kents 
 Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight 
 Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late 
 And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds 
 Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe DeVilles 
 Leaving the town in a-keeping 
 Of the one who is sweeping 
 Up the ghosts of Saturday nightLittle black girl in a red dress 
 A hot night with a broken shoe 
 Little black girl, you shoulda' never left home 
 There's probably someone still waitin' up for you 
 Cold back in Chicago 
 Los Angeles street is worse 
 All you got is $29.00, an alligator purse 
 I see that vulture in the Fleetwood 
 With the chartreuse hood 
 Trying to get your bearing 
 You say, "Hey baby, which way's the main stem?" 
 Wherever you say you're from 
 He'll say he grew up there himself 
 He gonna' come on and make you feel 
 Like you grew up right next door to him 
 Take left on Central 
 Gonna' throw it in reverse 
 All you got is $29.00, an alligator purse 
 Gonna' come on like just a gentleman 
 Oh baby, you're gonna' be a little shy 
 You say you ex old man was a sax player 
 He's "Baby, I used to play bass with Sly" 
 You say you like his Cadillac, he's "Honey, I got two or three" 
 Sweetheart you're sure fortunate 
 That you ran into me 
 He done a dime in the joint 
 You figured nothin' could be worse 
 $29.00, an alligator purse 
 Pharaoh on the eight track 
 Start smokin' a little boo 
 You' thinkin' gettin' out of Chicago was just about the 
 Best thing that ever happened to you 
 Startin' to like it already 
 This cat seems to be cool 
 Babe, I know a good hotel out in West Hollywood 
 Be just right for you 
 He ain't no Good Samaritan 
 He gonna' make sure he's reimbursed 
 Lot more than $29.00, an alligator purse 
 Now when the streets get hungry, baby 
 Almost hear them growl 
 Someone's setting a place for you 
 When the dogs begin to howl 
 The streets are dead 
 They creep up and take whatever is left on the bone 
 Remember, suckers always make mistakes 
 When they're far away from home 
 And the chicken in the pot 
 Whoever gets there first 
 Gonna' get themselves $29.00, an alligator purse 
 Now the siren's just an epilogue 
 Cops here always get there too late 
 Always stop for coffee on the way to the scene of the crime 
 They always try so hard just like movie stars 
 But they couldn't catch a cold 
 Baby, don't waste your dime 
 "Lucky to be alive" 
 The doctor whispered to the nurse 
 "She only lost a half a pint of blood 
 $29.00, an alligator purse"Long way going to 
 Get my medicine 
 Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren 
 Piano from a window played 
 Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday 
 I found it in the street 
 At first I did not see 
 Lying at my feet 
 A trampled rose 
 Passing the hat in church 
 It never stops going around 
 You never pay just once 
 To get the job done 
 What I done to me, 
 I done to you 
 What happened to the trampled rose? 
 In the muddy street 
 With the fireworks and leaves 
 A blind man with a cup I asked 
 Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine' 
 I know that rose, 
 Like I know my name 
 The one I gave my love, 
 It was the same 
 Now I find it in the street, 
 A trampled roseDanny says we gotta go 
 Gotta go to Idaho 
 But we can't go surfin' 
 'Cause it's 20 below 
 Sound check's at 5:02 
 Record stores and interviews 
 Oh, but I can't wait 
 To be with you tomorrow 
 Baby 
 Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go 
 And it may sound funny, but it's true 
 Hangin' out in 100 B 
 Watching Get Smart on TV 
 Thinkin' about 
 You and me and you and me 
 Hangin' out in L.A. 
 And there's nowhere to go 
 It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow 
 Listening to Sheena on the radio 
 Oh-ho oh-hoI’m going away 
 I’m going away 
 I’m going away 
 I’m going away 
 The cradle wants a baby 
 Kitchen wants a pan 
 The heart wants a certain kind of lover 
 If it can 
 The ocean wants a sailor 
 The gun wants a hand 
 Money wants a spender 
 And the road wants a man 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 And I turn my back on you 
 Devil wants a sinner 
 Sky wants a bird 
 Table wants a dinner 
 And the lips want a word 
 Glass wants the wine 
 Fist wants to hurt 
 Clock wants the time 
 And the shovel wants to work 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 I turned my face to the highway 
 And I turn my back on you 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 Coal wants a miner 
 Soldier takes a stand 
 The walls of the prison 
 Want a solitary man 
 The window wants a curtain 
 The plow wants the land 
 Diamond ring wants to 
 Fit upon the finger of her hand 
 I'll turn my face to the highway 
 I'll turn my face to the highway 
 I'll turn my face to the highway 
 And I'll turn my back on you 
 Going away 
 Going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going away 
 I'm going awayWell Frank settled down in the Valley 
 And hung his wild years 
 On a nail that he drove through 
 His wife's forehead 
 He sold used office furniture 
 Out there on San Fernando Road 
 And assumed a $30,000 loan 
 At 15 1/4 % and put down payment 
 On a little two bedroom place 
 His wife was a spent piece of used jet trash 
 Made good bloody marys 
 Kept her mouth shut most of the time 
 Had a little Chihuahua named Carlos 
 That had some kind of skin disease 
 And was totally blind. They had a 
 Thoroughly modern kitchen 
 Self-cleaning oven (the whole bit) 
 Frank drove a little sedan 
 They were so happy 
 One night Frank was on his way home 
 From work, stopped at the liquor store, 
 Picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths 
 Drank 'em in the car on his way 
 To the Shell station, he got a gallon of 
 Gas in a can, drove home, doused 
 Everything in the house, torched it, 
 Parked across the street, laughing, 
 Watching it burn, all Halloween 
 Orange and chimney red then 
 Frank put on a top forty station 
 Got on the Hollywood Freeway 
 Headed north 
 Never could stand that dogAll night long on the broken glass 
 Livin' in a medicine chest 
 Mediteromanian hotel back 
 Sprawled across a roll top desk 
 The old monkey rode the blade on an 
 Overhead fan 
 They paint the donkey blue if you pay 
 I got a telephone call from Istanbul 
 My baby's coming home today 
 Will you sell me one of those if I shave my head 
 Get me out of town is what fireball said 
 Never trust a man in a blue trench coat 
 Never drop a call when you're dead 
 Saturday's a festival 
 Friday's a gem 
 Dye your hair yellow 
 And raise your hem 
 Follow me to beulah's on 
 Dry creek road 
 I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed 
 Take me down to buy a tux 
 On red rose bear 
 Got to cut a hole in the day 
 I got a telephone call from Istanbul 
 My baby's coming home todayShe sends me blue valentines 
 All the way from Philadelphia 
 To mark the anniversary 
 Of someone that I used to be 
 And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest 
 Baby you got me checkin' in my rearview mirror 
 That's why I'm always on the run 
 Thats why I change my name 
 And I didn't think you'd ever find me here 
 To send me blue valentines 
 Like half-forgotten dreams 
 Like a pebble in my shoe 
 As I walk these streets 
 And the ghost of your memory 
 Baby, is the thistle in the kiss 
 It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck 
 It's the tattooed broken promise 
 I gotta hide beneath my sleeve 
 I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back 
 She sends me blue valentines 
 Though I try to remain at large 
 They're insisting that our love 
 Must have a eulogy 
 Why do I save all this madness 
 Here in the nightstand drawer 
 There to haunt upon my shoulders 
 Baby I know 
 I'd be luckier to walk around 
 Everywhere I go 
 With this blind and broken heart 
 That sleeps beneath my lapel 
 Instead, these blue valentines 
 To remind me of my cardinal sin 
 I can never wash the guilt 
 Or get these bloodstains off my hands 
 And it takes a whole lot of whiskey 
 To make these nightmares go away 
 And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night 
 And I'm gonna die just a little more 
 Each St. Valentine's Day 
 Don't you remember that I promised I would write you 
 These blue valentines 
 Blue valentines 
 Blue valentinesNow, George was a good straight boy to begin with 
 But there was bad blood in him, someway 
 And he got into the magic bullets and that lead straight to Devil's work 
 Just like marijuana leads to heroin 
 You think you can take them bullets or leave 'em, do you? 
 Just save a few for your bad days 
 Well, now, we all have those bad days when we can't hit for shit 
 The more of them magics you use, the more bad days you have without 'em 
 So it comes down to finally all your days being bad without the bullets 
 It's magics or nothing 
 Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself 
 Kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead 
 And that's where old George found himself 
 Out there at the crossroads molding the devil's bullets 
 Now a man figures it's his bullets, so it will take what he wants 
 It don't always work out that way 
 You see, some bullets is special for a single target 
 A certain stag, or a certain person 
 And no matter where you aim, that's where the bullet will end up 
 And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand 
 And point where the bullet wants to go 
 George Schmidt was moving in a series of convulsive spasms 
 Like someone with an epileptic fit 
 With his face contorted and his eyes wild 
 Like a lassoed horse bracing his legs 
 But something kept pulling him on 
 And now he is picking up the skulls and making the circle 
 I guess old George didn't rightly know what he was getting himself into 
 The fit was on him and it carried him right to the crossroadsWhy be sweet, why be careful, why be kind? 
 A man has only one thing on his mind 
 Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say please? 
 They only want to get you on your knees 
 There's a few things that I never could believe 
 A woman when she weeps 
 A merchant when he swears 
 A thief who says he'll pay 
 A lawyer when he cares 
 A snake when he's sleeping 
 A drunkard when he prays 
 I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good 
 And everything goes to hell anyway 
 Laissez-faire mi amour, ce la vie 
 Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea? 
 The world don't care what a sailor does in town 
 It's all hanging in the windows by the pound 
 I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good 
 Everything goes to hell anyway 
 I only want to hear you purr and to hear you moan 
 You have another man who brings the money home 
 I don't want dishes in the sink 
 Don't ask me what I feel or what I think 
 There's a few things that I never could believe 
 A woman when she weeps 
 A merchant when he swears 
 A thief who says he'll pay 
 A lawyer when he cares 
 A snake when he's sleeping 
 A drunkard when he prays 
 I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good 
 Everything goes to hell anyway 
 Everything goes to hell anyway 
 Oh, everything goes to hell anywayThe higher that the monkey can climb 
 The more he shows his tail 
 Call no man happy 'til he dies 
 There's no milk at the bottom of the pail 
 God builds a church, the devil builds a chapel 
 Like the thistles that are growing 'round the thrunk of a tree 
 All the good in the world you can put inside a thimble 
 And still have room for you and me 
 If there's one thing you can say about mankind 
 There's nothing kind about man 
 You can drive out nature with a pitch fork 
 But it always comes roaring back again 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 The higher that the monkey can climb 
 The more he shows his tail 
 Call no man happy 'til he dies 
 There's no milk at the bottom of the pail 
 God tempers all the winds for the new shorn lambs 
 The devil knows the Bible like the back of his hand 
 All the good in the world you can put inside a thimble 
 And still have room for you and me 
 For want of a bird 
 The sky was lost 
 For want of a nail 
 A shoe was lost 
 For want of a life 
 The knife was lost 
 For want of a toy 
 A child was lost 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Everybody Row! Everybody Row! 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Misery's the River of the World 
 Everybody Row! Everybody Row!He had 3 whole dollars, 
 A worn out car 
 And a wife who was leaving for good 
 Life's made of trouble, 
 Worry, pain and struggle 
 She wrote 'good bye' in the dust on the hood 
 They found a map of Missouri 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 They must of left in the middle of the night 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 Everyone wants to know 
 How's it going to end? 
 Behind a smoke colored curtain, 
 The girl disappeared 
 They found out that the ring was a fake 
 A tree born crooked, 
 Will never grow straight 
 She sunk like a hammer into the lake 
 A long lost letter and 
 And old leaky boat 
 Promises are never meant to keep 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 I wanna know 
 How's it going to end? 
 The barn leaned over, 
 The vultures dried their wings 
 The moon climbed up an empty sky 
 The sun sank down, 
 Behind the tree on the hill 
 There's a killer and he's coming through the rye 
 But maybe he's the father, 
 Of that lost little girl 
 It's hard to tell in this light 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 Everyone wants to know 
 How's it going to end? 
 Drag your wagon and your plow, 
 Over the bones of the dead 
 Out among the roses and the weeds 
 You can never go back, 
 And the answer is 'no' 
 And wishing for it only makes it bleed 
 Joel Tornabene, 
 Was broken on the wheel 
 Shane and Bum Mahoney on the lamb 
 The grain was as gold, 
 As Sheila's hair 
 All the way from Liverpool, with all we could steal 
 He was robbed of twenty dollars 
 His body found stripped 
 Cast into the harbour there and drowned 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 We all wanna know 
 How's it going to end? 
 The sirens are snaking, 
 Their way up the hill 
 It's last call somewhere in the world 
 The reptiles blend in, 
 With the color of the street 
 Life is sweet at the edge of a razor 
 And down in the first row, 
 Of an old picture show 
 The old man is asleep, as the credits start to roll 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 We all wanna know 
 How's it going to end? 
 And I want to know the same thing 
 We all wanna know 
 How's it going to end? 
 And I just want to know the same thing 
 I wanna know 
 How's it going to end?Tonight I'll shave the mountain 
 I'll cut the hearts from pharoahs 
 I pull the road off of the rise 
 Tear the memories from my eyes 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 I drink 1000 shipwrecks 
 Tonight I'll steal your paychecks 
 I paint the sheets across my bed 
 The birds will all fly from my head 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 Take every dream that's breathing 
 Find every boot that's leaving 
 Shoot all the lights in the cafe 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 I bet 1000 dollars 
 I have a French companion 
 I tie myself below the deck 
 I pull the rope around my neck 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 It takes a life to win her 
 There is a drum of bourbon 
 800 pounds of nitro 
 His boots are thunder as he plays 
 Theree is a stone inside it 
 Tonight his bones will ride it 
 I'll need a tent to hide it 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 And in the morning I'll be gone 
 And in the morning I'll be goneI'm singing this song, 'cause it's time it was sung 
 I've been putting it off for a while 
 But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear 
 That I cry when I'm seeing you smile 
 So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear 
 And your tears cannot bind me anymore 
 And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be gone 
 Every time that I tried to tell you that we'd 
 Lost the magic we had at the start 
 I would weep, my heart, when I looked in your eyes 
 And I searched once again for the spark 
 So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear 
 And your tears cannot bind me anymore 
 And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be gone 
 I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go 
 So I'll leave you to cry in the rain 
 Though I held in my hand the key to all joy 
 Honey, my heart was not born to be tamed 
 So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear 
 And your tears cannot bind me anymore 
 And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be gone 
 So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear 
 And your tears cannot bind me anymore 
 And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be gone 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be gone 
 Can I kiss you and then I'll be goneThe sky's as deep as it can be 
 Bend down the branches 
 Close your eyes and you will see 
 Bend down the branches 
 You're like a willow once you weregold 
 We're made for bending, even beauty gets old 
 Climb the stairs, they're not so steep 
 Bend down the branches 
 Close your eyes and go to sleep 
 Bend down the branchesWell, you hate those diesels rollin' 
 And those Friday nights out bowlin' 
 When he's off for a twelve hour lay overnight 
 You wish you had a dollar 
 For every time he hollered 
 That he's leavin' and he's never comin' back 
 But the curtain laced below 
 His hands on your pillow 
 And his trousers are hangin' on the chair 
 You're lyin' through your pain, babe 
 But you're gonna tell him he's your man 
 And you ain't got the courage to leave 
 He tells you that you're on his mind 
 You're the only one he's ever gonna find 
 It's kinda special, understands his complicated soul 
 But the only place a man can breathe 
 And collect his thoughts is 
 Midnight and flyin' away on the road 
 But you've packed and unpacked 
 So many times you've lost track 
 And the steam heat is drippin' off the walls 
 But when you hear his engines 
 You're lookin' through the window in the kitchen and you know 
 You're always gonna be there when he calls 
 'Cause he's a truck drivin' man 
 Stoppin' when he can 
 He's a truck drivin' man 
 Stoppin' when he canIf you don't want these arms to hold you 
 If you don't want these lips to kiss you 
 If you've found someone new 
 Put me back in the crowd 
 Put the sun behind the clouds 
 Put me back in the crowd 
 There's a battle going on 
 Between the blue and the gray 
 And if you don't want my love 
 Don't make me stay 
 There's a battle going on 
 Between the blue and gray 
 And if you don't want my love 
 Don't make me stay 
 Take back your name 
 Take back these wings 
 Take my picture from the frame 
 And put me back in the crowd 
 Put the sun behind the cloud 
 Put me back in the crowd 
 Put me back in the crowd 
 Put the sun behind the cloud 
 Put me back in the crowdI like my town 
 With a little drop of poison 
 Nobody knows 
 They're lining up to go insane 
 I'm all alone 
 I smoked my friends 
 Down to the filter 
 But I feel much cleaner 
 After it rains 
 And she left in the fall 
 That's her picture on the wall 
 She always had that little drop of poison 
 Did the devil make the world 
 While god was sleeping? 
 You'll never get a wish from a bone 
 Another long goodbye 
 And a hundred sailors 
 That deep blue sky is my home 
 And she left in the fall 
 That's her picture on the wall 
 She always had that little drop of poison 
 Well the rat always knows 
 When he's in with weasels 
 Here you lose a little every day 
 Well I remember when a million 
 Was a million 
 They all have ways to make you pay 
 And she left in the fall 
 That's her picture on the wall 
 She always had that little drop of poison 
 And she left in the fall 
 That's her picture on the wall 
 She always had that little drop of poisonRattle big black bones 
 In the danger zone 
 There's a rumblin' groan 
 Down below 
 There's a big dark town 
 It's a place I've found 
 There's a world going on 
 Underground 
 They're alive, they're awake 
 While the rest of the world is asleep 
 Below the mine shaft roads 
 It will all unfold 
 There's a world going on 
 Underground 
 All the roots hang down 
 Swing from town to town 
 They are marching around 
 Down under your boots 
 All the trucks unload 
 Beyond the gopher holes 
 There's a world going on 
 UndergroundRomeo is bleeding 
 But not so as you'd notice 
 He's over on 18th street as usual 
 Lookin' so hard against the hood of his car 
 And puttin' out a cigarette in his hand 
 For all the pachucos at the pumps 
 At Romero's Paint and Body 
 They all seein' how far they can spit 
 Well it was just another night 
 But now they're huddled in the brake lights of a 58 Belair 
 And listenin' to how Romeo killed a sherriff with his knife 
 And they all jump when they hear the sirens 
 But Romeo just laughs 
 'Cause all the racket in the world ain't never gonna 
 Save that coppers ass 
 He never gonna see another summertime for gunnin' down my brother 
 And leavin' him like a dog beneath a car without his knife 
 Romeo says, "Hey man gimme a cigarette" 
 And they all reach for their pack 
 And Frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back 
 Throws a bottle at a milk truck 
 And as it breaks he grabs his nuts 
 And they all know they could be just like Romeo 
 If they only had the guts 
 But Romeo is bleeding 
 But nobody can tell 
 He sings along with the radio 
 With a bullet in his chest 
 And he combs back his fenders 
 And they all agree it's clear 
 That every thing is cool now that Romeo is here 
 But Romeo is bleeding 
 And he winces now and then 
 He leans against the car door 
 Feels the blood in his shoes 
 Someone's crying in the 5 point 
 In the phone booth by the store 
 Romeo starts his engines 
 Wipes the blood off the door 
 And he brodys through the signal 
 With the radio full blast 
 Leavin' the boys there hikin' up their chinos 
 And they all try to stand like Romeo 
 With the moon cut like a sickle 
 And they're talkin' now in Spanish all about their hero 
 Romeo is bleeding 
 And he gives the man his ticket 
 He climbs to the balcony at the movies 
 He'll die without a whimper 
 Like every hero's dream 
 Like an angel with a bullet 
 And Cagney on the screen 
 Romeo is bleeding 
 Romeo is bleeding, hey man 
 Romeo is bleeding, hey man 
 Romeo is bleeding, hey man 
 Romeo is bleedingOnce upon a time there was a poor child, 
 With no father and no mother 
 And everything was dead 
 And no one was left in the whole world 
 Everything was dead 
 And the child went on search, day and night 
 And since nobody was left on the earth, 
 He wanted to go up into the heavens 
 And the moon was looking at him so friendly 
 And when he finally got to the moon, 
 The moon was a piece of rotten wood 
 And then he went to the sun 
 And when he got there, the sun was a wilted sunflower 
 And when he got to the stars, they were little golden flies. 
 Stuck up there, like the shrike sticks 'em on a blackthorn 
 And when he wanted to go back, down to earth, 
 The earth was an overturned piss pot 
 And he was all alone, and he sat down and he cried 
 And he is there till this day 
 All alone: 
 Okay, there's your story! 
 Night-night!Well, I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn 
 Nobody's up except the moon and me 
 And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree 
 All that you left me was a melody 
 Rosie, why do you evade? 
 Rosie, how can I persuade? 
 Rosie 
 And the moon's all up, full and big 
 Apricot tips in an indigo sky 
 And I've been loving you, Rosa, since the day I was born 
 And I'll love you, Rosie, till the day I die 
 Rosie, why do you evade? 
 Rosie, how can I persuade? 
 Rosie 
 Rosie, why do you evade? 
 Rosie, how can I persuade? 
 Rosie 
 And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn 
 Nobody's up except the moon and me 
 And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree 
 All that you left me was a melody 
 Rosie, why do you evade? 
 Rosie, how can I persuade? 
 RosieEver since I put your picture 
 Sun come up it was blue and gold 
 Sun come up it was blue and gold 
 Sun come up it was blue and gold 
 Ever since I put your picture 
 In a frame 
 I come calling in my Sunday best 
 I come calling in my Sunday best 
 I come calling in my Sunday best 
 Every since I put your picture 
 In a frame 
 I'm gonna love you 
 Till the wheels come off 
 Oh yeah 
 I love you baby and I always will 
 I love you baby and I always will 
 I love you baby and I always will 
 Ever since I put your picture 
 In a frameThere was a murder in the red barn 
 A murder in the red barn 
 The trees are bending over and the cows are lying down 
 The autumn's taking over, you can hear the buckshot hounds 
 The watchman said to Reba the the loon 
 Was it pale at Manzanita, was it blind Bob the coon? 
 Pin it on a drifter, they sleep beneath the bridge 
 One plays the violin and sleeps inside a fridge 
 There was a murder in the red barn 
 Murder in the red barn 
 Someone's crying in the woods, someone's burying all his clothes 
 Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer slept outside last night and froze 
 Roadkill has its seasons just like anything 
 There's possums in the autumn and there's farm cats in the spring 
 There was a murder in the red barn 
 Murder in the red barn 
 Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house 
 Or covet thy neighbor's wife 
 But for some murder's the only door 
 Through which they enter life 
 Now they surrounded the house, they smoked him out and took him off in chains 
 The sky turned black and bruised and months of heavy rains 
 Now the ravens nest in the rotted roof of Chenoweth's old place 
 And no one's asking Cal about that scar upon his face 
 'Cause there's nothing strange about an axe with bloodstains in the barn 
 There's always some killing you've got to do around the farm 
 A murder in the red barn 
 Murder in the red barn 
 The woods will never tell what sleeps beneath the trees 
 Or what's buried beneath a rock or hiding in the leaves 
 'Cause roadkill has its seasons just like anything 
 It's possums in the autumn and it's farm cats in the spring 
 A murder in the red barn 
 Murder in the red barn 
 Now a lady can't do nothing without folks' tongues wagging 
 Is that blood on the tree or is it autumn's red blaze? 
 When the ground is soft for digging and the rain will bring all this gloom 
 There's nothing wrong with a lady drinking alone in her room 
 But there was a murder in the red barn 
 A murder in the red barn 
 There was a murder in the red barn 
 A murder in the red barn 
 There was a murder in the red barn 
 A murder in the red barnWell, I'm goin' out west where the wind blows tall 
 'Cause Tony Franciosa used to date my ma 
 They got some money out there, they're giving it away 
 I'm gonna do what I want and I'm gonna get paid 
 Do what I want and I'm gonna get paid 
 Little brown sausages lying in the sand

 Well, my parole officer will be proud of me 
 With my Olds '88 and the devil on a leash 
 My Olds '88 and the devil on a leash 
 I know karate, voodoo too 
 I'm gonna make myself available to you 
 I don't need no make up, I got real scars 
 I've got hair on my chest, I look without a shirt 
 Well, I don't lose my composure in a high speed chase 
 Well, my friends think I'm ugly, I got a masculine face 
 I got some drag strip courage, I can really drive a bed 
 I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal or maybe just Rex 
 Change my name to Hannibal or maybe just Rex 
 I know karate, voodoo too 
 I'm gonna make myself available to you 
 I don't need no make up, I got real scars 
 I've got hair on my chest, I look without a shirt 
 I'm gonna drive all night, get some speed 
 I'm gonna wait for the sun to shine down on me 
 I cut a hole in my roof in the shape of a heart 
 And I'm goin' out west where they'll appreciate me 
 I'm goin' out west where they'll appreciate me

 Wet in the water, weeping in the sun 
 Books of Moses, got some splinters didn't you 
 Books of Moses, brought me right here back to you 
 Flaming heart, ain't it sweet 
 Lighting the world at your feet 
 Books of Moses, myth and truth 
 Books of Moses, bring me back to you 
 Hero's welcome, there stands your king 
 Where the serpent shudders and the angels sing 
 Books of Moses, happening again 
 Yes he knows us 
 Well welcome him, your friend 
 Books of Moses, bringing stone news 
 Wet is the water, blood covering the sun 
 Books of Moses, myth and truth 
 Books of Moses, bring me back to youWell it's 9th and Hennepin 
 All the donuts have names that sound like prostitutes 
 And the moon's teeth marks 
 Are on the sky like a tarp thrown all over this 
 And the broken umbrellas like dead birds 
 The steam comes out of the grill like the whole goddamned town is ready to blow 
 And the bricks are all scarred with jail house tattoos 
 And everyone is behaving like dogs 
 And the horses are coming down Violin Road and Dutch is dead on his feet 
 And all the rooms they smell like diesel and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there 
 And I'm lost in the window 
 I hide on the stairway and I hang in the curtain and I sleep in your hat 
 And no one brings anything small into a bar around here 
 They all started out with bad directions 
 And the girl behind the counter has a tattooed tear 
 One for every year he's away, she said 
 Such a crumbling beauty 
 Ah, there's nothin' wrong with her a hundred dollars won't fix 
 She has that razor sadness that only gets worse with the clang and the thunder 
 Of the Southern Pacific going by 
 And the clock ticks out like a dripping faucet 
 Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin 
 And you spill out over the side to anyone who'll listen 
 I've seen it all 
 I've seen it all through the yellow windows of the evening trainYou haven't looked at me that way in years 
 You dreamed me up and left me here 
 How long was I dreaming for? 
 What was it you wanted me for? 
 You haven't looked at me that way in years 
 Your watch has stopped and the pond is clear 
 Someone turn the lights back on 
 I love you till all time is gone 
 You haven't looked at me that way in years 
 But I'm still hereA cloud lets go of the moon 
 Her ribbons are all out of tune 
 She's skating on the ice in a glass 
 In the hands of a man 
 That she kissed on the train 
 And the children have all gone into town 
 To get candy 
 And we are alone in the house here 
 And your eyes fall down on me 
 I belong only to you 
 The water is filling my shoes 
 In the wine of my heart 
 There's a stone in a well made of bone 
 That you bring to the pond 
 And I'm here in your pocket 
 Curled up in a dollar 
 And the chain from your watch 
 Around my neck 
 And I'll stay right here until it's time 
 The girls all knit in the shade 
 Before the baby is made 
 And the branches bend down 
 To the ground here to swing on 
 I'm lost in the blond summer grass 
 And the train whistle blows 
 And the carnival goes 
 Till there's only the tickets and crows here 
 And the grass will all grow back 
 The branches spell Alice 
 And I belong only to youWell it's raining, it's pouring 
 Didn't bring a sweater 
 Nebraska never let you come back home 
 And on Hollywood and Vine 
 By the Thrifty Mart sign 
 Any night I'll be willin' to bet 
 There's a young girl 
 With sweet little dreams 
 And pretty blue wishes 
 Standin' there just gettin' all wet 
 Now there's a place off the drag 
 Called the Gilbert Hotel 
 And there's a couple letters burned out in the sign 
 And it's better than the bus stop 
 And they do good business every time it rains 
 For little girls 
 With nothing in their jeans 
 But pretty blue wishes 
 Sweet little thing 
 And it's raining, it's pouring 
 Old man is snoring 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I hear the sirens in the street 
 All my dreams are made of chrome 
 I have no way to get back home 
 I'd rather die before I wake 
 Like Marilyn Monroe 
 And throw my dreams out in the street 
 Let the rain make 'em grow 
 Now the night clerk, he got a club foot 
 He's heard every hard luck story 
 At least a hundred times or more 
 He says check out time is 10am 
 And that's just what he means 
 Go on up the stairs 
 With your sweet little wishes 
 And your pretty blue dreams 
 And it's raining it's pouring 
 Hollywood's just fine 
 Swindle a little girl out of her dreams 
 Another letter in the sign 
 Now never trust a scarecrow 
 Wearin' shades after dark 
 Be careful of that old bow tie he wears 
 It takes a sweet little bullet 
 From a pretty blue gun 
 To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair 
 No, that ain't no cherry bomb 
 4th of July's all done 
 Just some fool playin' that second line 
 From the barrel of a pretty blue gun 
 No, that ain't no cherry bomb 
 4th of July's all done 
 That's some fool playin' that second line 
 From the barrel of a pretty blue gunHe keeps to himself 
 And I think I know why... 
 He took down the tire swing from the pepper tree 
 He has no children of his own, you see 
 He has no dog 
 He has no friends 
 His lawn is dying 
 And what are those packages he sends? 
 What's he building in there? 
 He's got a hook light on the stairs 
 What's he building in there? 
 Tell you one thing, he's not building a playhouse for the children 
 But what's he building in there? 
 What's that sound from underneath the door 
 He's pounding nails through a hardwood floor 
 I swear to God I heard someone moaning low 
 I keep seeing the blue light of a TV show 
 He has a router 
 And a table-saw 
 You won't believe what Mr. Stitcha saw 
 There's poison underneath the sink, of course 
 But there's also enough formaldehyde to choke a horse 
 What's he building in there? 
 What the hell is he building in there? 
 I heard he has an ex-wife in someplace called Mayor's Income, Tennesee 
 And he used to have a consulting business in Indonesia 
 But what's he building in there? 
 He has no friends 
 But he gets a lot of mail 
 I bet he's spent a little time in jail 
 I heard he was up on the roof last night 
 Signaling with a flashlight 
 What's that tune he's always whistling? 
 What's he building in there? 
 What's he building in there? 
 We have a right to knowWe put up our tent on a dark 
 Green knoll, outside of town by 
 The train tracks and a seagull dump 
 Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel 
 And her 'Marvellous Pigs In Satin' 
 We pounded our stakes in the ground 
 All powder brown 
 And the branches spread like scary 
 Fingers reaching 
 We were in a pasture outside Kankakee 
 And One Eyed Myra, the queen of 
 The galley who trained the 
 Ostrich and the camels 
 She looked at me squinty with her 
 One good eye in a Roy Orbison 
 T-shirt as she bottle fed 
 An orangutan named Tripod 
 And then there was 
 Yodeling Elaine the 
 Queen of the air who wore a 
 Dollar sign medallion and she 
 Had a tiny bubble of spittle 
 Around her nostril and a 
 Little rusty tear, for she had 
 Lassoed and lost another 
 Tipsy sailor 
 And over in 
 The burnt yellow tent 
 By the frozen tractor, the 
 Music was like electric sugar 
 And Zuzu Bolin played 
 'Stavin' Chain' and Mighty 
 Tiny on the saw and he 
 Threw his head back with a 
 Mouth full of gold teeth 
 And they played 'Lopsided heart' 
 And 'Moon over Dog Street' 
 And by the time they played "Moanin Low" 
 I was soakin' wet and wild eyed 
 And Doctor Bliss slipped me a 
 Preparation and I fell asleep with 
 'Livery Stable Blues' in my ear 
 And me and Molley Hoey drank 
 Pruno and Koolaid and she had a 
 Tattoo gun made out of a cassette 
 Motor and a guitar string and 
 She soaked a hanky in 3 Roses 
 And rubbed it on the spot 
 And drew a rickety heart and 
 A bent arrow and it hurt like hell 
 And Funeral Wells spun 
 Poodle Murphy on the target 
 As he threw his hardware, 
 Only once in Sheboygan did he miss 
 At a matinee on Diamond Pier and 
 She'd never let him forget it 
 They were doing two shows and she 
 Had a high fever and he took 
 Off a piece of her ear and 
 Tip Little told her she should 
 Leave the bum 
 But Poodle said, "He fetched me 
 Last time I run." 
 But I'd like to hammer this ring into a bullet 
 And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun 
 My dear 
 And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun 
 My dearPhone's off the hook 
 No one knows where we are 
 It's a long time since I 
 Drank champagne 
 The ocean is blue 
 As blue as your eyes 
 I'm gonna take it with me 
 When I go 
 Old long since gone 
 Now way back when 
 We lived in Coney Island 
 Ain't no good thing 
 Ever dies 
 I'm gonna take it with me 
 When I go 
 Far far away a train 
 Whistle blows 
 Wherever you're goin' 
 Wherever you've been 
 Waving good bye at the end 
 Of the day 
 You're up and you're over 
 And you're far away 
 Always for you, and 
 Forever yours 
 It felt just like the old days 
 We fell asleep on Beaula's porch 
 I'm gonna take it with me 
 When I go 
 All broken down by 
 The side of the road 
 I was never more alive or 
 Alone 
 I've worn the faces off 
 All the cards 
 I'm gonna take it with me 
 When I go 
 Children are playing 
 At the end of the day 
 Strangers are singing 
 On our lawn 
 It's got to be more 
 Than flesh and bone 
 All that you've loved 
 Is all you own 
 In a land there's a town 
 And in that town there's 
 A house 
 And in that house 
 There's a woman 
 And in that woman 
 There's a heart I love 
 I'm gonna take it 
 With me when I go 
 I'm gonna take it 
 With me when I goWhen I'm gone, huh 
 When I'm gone 
 Roll my vertebrae out like dice 
 Let my skull be a home for the mice 
 Let me bleach like the bones on the beach 
 I'll be hard like a pit from a peach 
 Now the ground has a branch, huh 
 Now the hound has a ranch, huh 
 The old tressel’s just junk 
 The Edsel is on blocks 
 The old said so won’t talk 
 I'm a blimp that's straining, cut 'er ties 
 I'm a moth in training, flutter by, huh 
 When I'm gone 
 When I'm gone 
 I said I will have satisfaction 
 I will be satisfied 
 I said I will be satisfied 
 When I'm believing: satisfaction 
 When I'm grieving: satisfaction 
 When I'm shaking: satisfaction 
 When I'm praying, huh: satisfaction 
 When I'm staying: satisfaction 
 When I'm carousing, he heh 
 When I'm a thousand 
 I said I will have satisfaction 
 I will be satisfied 
 Before I'm gone 
 Before I'm gone 
 I will have satisfaction 
 I will be satisfied 
 I will have satisfaction 
 I will be satisfied 
 Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards 
 I will scratch where I’ve been itching 
 Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards 
 I will scratch where I’ve been itching 
 Before I'm gone 
 Before I'm gone 
 Before I'm gone 
 Before I'm gone, wow 
 Let me go back into the barrel 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel 
 Before I'm gone 
 Before I'm gone 
 I said I will have satisfaction, huh 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel 
 Take a left off the straight and the narrow 
 Let the bullet go back into the barrel, huh 
 Wow 
 Wow 
 Before I'm goneI lost everything I had in the twenty nine flood 
 Barn was buried beneath a mile of mud 
 Now, I'm down to nothing but the whistle and the steam 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 Now there's a fella been preaching about hell and damnation 
 Bouncing off the walls at the Grand Central Station 
 I treated her bad, I treated her mean 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 I said hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 Hey, hey, I will remember you 
 Hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 Now I've always been puzzled about the yin and the yang 
 Come out in the wash, but it always leaves a stain 
 Sturm and the drang, the luster and the sheen 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 I said hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 Hey, hey, I will remember you 
 Hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 Toss the baby with the water, and the preacher stole the bride 
 Sent her out for a bottle, but when she come back inside 
 She didn't bring my whiskey, she didn't bring my gin 
 She had a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin 
 I said hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 Hey, hey, I will remember you 
 Hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteen 
 On the train you get smaller, as you get farther away 
 The roar covers everything you wanted to say 
 Was that a raindrop in the corner of your eye? 
 Were you drying your nails or waving goodbye? 
 I said: hey, hey, I will remember you 
 Hey, hey, I don't know what to do 
 Hey, hey, I will remember you 
 My baby's leaving town on the two nineteenEvery night she comes 
 To take me out to dreamland 
 When I'm with her, I'm the richest man in the town 
 She's a rose, she's a pearl 
 She's the spin on my world 
 All the stars make their wishes on her eyes 
 She's my Coney Island baby 
 She's my Coney Island girl 
 She's a princess in a red dress 
 She's the moon in the mist to me 
 She's my Coney Island baby

 He's gonna cover us up with leaves with a blanket from the moon 
 With a promise and a vow and a lullaby for my brow 
 Jesus gonna be here, gonna be here soon 
 Well, I'm not gonna do nothing but wait here, I don't have to shout 
 I got no reason and I got no doubt 
 I'm gonna get myself unfurled from this mortal coiled up world 
 Jesus gonna be here, gonna be here soon 
 I got to keep my eyes, keep 'em wide open so I can see my Lord 
 I'm gonna watch the horizon for a brand new Ford 
 I can hear him rolling on down the lane, I said Hollywood be thy name 
 'Cause Jesus gonna be here, he's gonna be here soon 
 Well, I've got to keep myself, keep myself faithful and you know that I've been so good 
 Except for drinking, but he knew that I would 
 And when I'm gonna leave this place better than the way I found that it was 
 And Jesus gonna be here, he's gonna be here soon 
 I know my Jesus gonna be here 
 He's gonna be here soon

 Sing Sing Tommy Shay Boys 
 God used me as hammer boys 
 To beat his weary drum today 
 Hoist that rag [2x] 
 The sun is up the world is flat 
 Damn good address for a rat 
 The smell of blood 
 The Drone of flies 
 You know what to do if 
 The baby cries 
 Hoist that rag [2x] 
 Well we stick our fingers in 
 The ground, heave and 
 Turn the world around 
 Smoke is blacking out the sun 
 At night I pray and clean my gun 
 The cracked bell rings as 
 The ghost bird sings and the gods 
 Go beggin here 
 So just open fire 
 As you hit the shore 
 All is fair in love 
 And war 
 Hoist that rag [4x]Well, take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth 
 Just like they say in the Bible 
 Never leave a trace or forget a face 
 Of any man at the table, any man at the table 
 When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger 
 And it's sharp enough to draw blood from a stone 
 He rides through your dreams on a coach and horses 
 And the fence posts in the moonlight look like bones 
 Well, they've stopped trying to hold him with mortar, stone and chain 
 He broke out of every prison 
 Well, the boots mount the staircase, the door's flung back open 
 He's not there, for he has risen, he's not there, for he has risen 
 Some say he once killed a man with a guitar string 
 He's been seen at the table with kings 
 Well, he once saved a baby from drowning 
 There are those who say beneath his coat, there are wings 
 Well, some say they fear him, others admire him 
 Because he steals his promise 
 One look in his eye and everyone denies 
 Ever having met him, ever having met him 
 He can turn himself into a stranger 
 Well, they broke a lot of canes on his hide 
 He was born away in a corn field 
 A fever beats in his head just like a drum inside 
 Some say they fear him, others admire him 
 Because he steals his promise 
 One look in his eye and everyone denies 
 Ever having met him, ever having met himIt's the same with men as with horses and dogs 
 Nothing wants to die 
 Evelyn James they killed in a game 
 With guns too big for their hands 
 Just off St. Charles in no man's land and 
 You'll have to find your own way home, boys 
 You'll have to find your own way home 
 The oldest was Troy 
 An eighteen year old boy 
 Shot dead in March in a robbery 
 His brother started out 
 To hell and to ruin 
 Troy's killer was never caught they say 
 Young Nick he just went bad that day 
 Now he'll have to find his own way home, boys 
 He'll have to find his own way home 
 Why cook dinner 
 Why make my bed 
 Why come home at all 
 Out the door and through the woods 
 There's a world where nothing grows 
 It's hard to say grace and to sit in the place 
 Of someone missing at the table 
 Mom's hair sprayed tight 
 And her face in her hands 
 Watching t.v. for answers 
 To me 
 After all she's only human 
 And she's trying to find her own way home, boys 
 She's trying to find her own way home 
 My legs ache, my heart is sore 
 The well is full of penniesNo shadows 
 No stars 
 There's no moon and 
 No cars 
 November 
 It only believes 
 In a pile of dead leaves 
 And a moon 
 That's the color of bone 
 No prayers for November 
 To linger longer 
 Stick your spoon in the wall 
 And we'll slaughter them all 
 November has tied me 
 To an old dead tree 
 Get word to April 
 To rescue me 
 November's cold chain 
 Made of wet boots and rain 
 Shiny black ravens 
 On chimney smoke lanes 
 November seems odd 
 You're my firing squad 
 November 
 With my hair slicked back 
 With carrion shellac 
 And the blood from a pheasant 
 With the bone from a hare 
 Tied to the branches 
 Of a roebuck stag 
 Left to wave in the timber 
 Like a buck shot flag 
 Go away you rainsnout 
 Go away blow your brains out 
 NovemberThe Whirligig Beetles are wary and fast with an organ to detect the ripples. 
 The Arachnid Moths lay their eggs inside other insects along the borders of fields or roads in clusters of white cocoons. 
 The Ribbed Pine Borer is a longhorn beetle, their antenna's are half the length of their body and they feed on dead red pine. 
 Robber Flies, with their immobile heads, inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey that they snatch from life in mid-air. 
 The Snow Flea's mode of locomotion, strange and odd, with a spiny tail mechanism with hooks and a protracted tube from the abdomen to enable moisture absorption. 
 The female Praying Mantis devours the male while they are mating. The male sometimes continues copulating even after the female has bitten off his head and part of his upper torso. 
 Every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant, lock their mandibles into position, stretch out at right angles to the stem and, with legs dangling, they fall asleep. 
 If one places a minute amount of liquor on a scorpion, it will instantly go mad and sting itself to death. 
 The Bombardier Beetle, when disturbed, defends itself by emitting a series of explosions, sometimes setting off 4 or 5 reports in succession. The noises sound like miniature popgun blasts and are accompanied by a cloud of reddish coloured vile smelling fluid. 
 It is commonly known that ants keep slaves. Certain species, the so-called Sanguinary Ants in particular, will raid the nests of other ant tribes and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers. The workers are brought back to the captor's hive where they are coerced into performing menial tasks. 
 And as we discussed last semester, the Army Ants will leave nothing but your bones. 
 Perhaps you've encountered some of these insects in your communities, displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics, while imbedded within the walls of flesh and passing for, what is most commonly recognized... as humanWell Zenora Bariella 
 And Coriander Pyle 
 They had sixteen children 
 In the usual style 
 They had a curio museum 
 And they had no guile 
 All they ever wanted 
 Was a show biz child 
 So on the 7th of Dec. 1949 
 They got what 
 They'd been wishing for 
 All of the time 
 He grew up in a trailer 
 By the time he was 9 
 He rolled off to join 
 The circus... telling fortunes

 Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 Well the first time I saw him 
 Was a Saigon jail 
 Cost me 27 dollars 
 Just to go his bail

 Be in lights...

 But you got to have 
 A manager that's what

 Well he was born without a body 
 Not even a brow 
 I made the kid a promise 
 I made the kid a vow 
 He's not conventionally handsome 
 He'll never be tall 
 He said "all you got to do is 
 Book me into Carnegie Hall" 
 Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 He's just a little bitty thing 
 He's just a little guy 
 But women go crazy 
 For the big blue eye 
 They say how does he 
 Dream? How does he think 
 When he can't ever speak 
 And he can't ever blink? 
 I said Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 Give it up and throw me down 
 A couple of quic 
 Everybody wants to see 
 The Eyeball kid 
 How dies he dream 
 How does he think 
 When he can't even speak 
 And he can't even blink 
 We are all lost in the 
 Wilderness we're as 
 Blind as can be

 How to really see

 Don't buy roses off the street down there 
 Took it all and took the dirt road home 
 Dreamin' of Jenny with the light brown hair 
 Night is fallin' like a bloody axe 
 Lies and rumours and the wind at my back 
 Hand on the wheel, gravel on the road 
 Will the pawn shop sell me back 
 What I sold 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my father 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my mother 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my brother 
 Down to the pond 
 Birds cry warnin' from a hidden branch 
 Carvin' out a future with a gun and an axe 
 I'm way beyond the gavel and the laws of man 
 Still livin' in the palm on the grace of your hand 
 World's not easy the blind man said 
 Turns on nothin' but money and dread 
 Dog's been scratchin' at the door all night 
 Long neck birds flyin' out of the moon light 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my father 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my mother 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my brother

 Long bell tollin' your Waterloo 
 Oh baby, what can you do? 
 Does the light of God blind you 
 Or lead the way home for you?

 Humiliation of our fallen state

 The rip and the moan and the stretch of the rack 
 All my belongings in a flour sack

 But the mind is Hell

 I'm gonna take the sins of my father 
 Take the sins of my mother 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my brother 
 Down to the pond 
 Down to the pond 
 Kissed my sweetheart by the chinaball tree 
 Everything I done is between God and me 
 Only He will judge how my time was spent 
 Twenty - nine days of sinnin' 
 And forty to repent 
 The horse is steady but the horse is blind 
 Wicked are the branches on the tree of mankind 
 Roots grow upward and the branches grow down 
 It's much too late to throw the dice again 
 I've found 
 I'm gonna take the sins of my father 
 Take the sins of my mother 
 Gonna take the sins of my brother 
 Down to the pond 
 I'm gonna wash them 
 I'm gonna wash them 
 I'm gonna wash the sins of my father 
 I'm gonna wash the sins of my mother 
 Wash the sins of my brother 
 Till the water runs clear 
 Till the water runs clear 
 Till the water runs clearGet a job, save your money, listen to Jane 
 Everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain 
 All the news is bad 
 Is there any other kind? 
 Everybody's talking at the same time 
 And everybody’s talking at the same time 
 Well it's hard times for some, for others it's sweet 
 Someone makes money when there’s blood in the street 
 Don't take any lip, stay in line 
 Everybody's talking at the same time 
 Well, the dog is in the kitchen and the war drags on 
 The trees wait by the freeway, all the money's gone 
 Well, she told me she would leave me 
 I ignored all the signs 
 And now everybody's talking at the same time 
 Everybody's talking at the same time 
 Ain't no one coming to pull you from the mud 
 You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood 
 I know you're leaving and there's no more next time 
 Everybody's talking at the same time 
 Well, a tiny boy sat and he played in the sand 
 He made a sword from a stick and a gun from his hand 
 Well, we bailed out all the millionaires 
 They got the fruit, we got the rind 
 And everybody's talking at the same time 
 Everybody's talking at the same timeRound the curve of the Parrot Bar 
 A broken-down old movie star 
 Hustling an easterner 
 Bringing out the beast in her 
 A high dive on a swimming pool 
 Filled with needles and with fools 
 The memories are short but the tales are long 
 When you're in the Reeperbahn 
 They called her Rosie when she was a girl 
 For her bright red cheeks and her strawberry curls 
 When she would laugh, the river would run 
 Said she'd be a comedian 
 Oh what a pity, oh what a shame 
 When she said come calling, nobody came 
 Her bright red cheeks are painted on 
 And she's laughing her head off in the Reeperbahn 
 Now little Hans was always strange 
 Wearing women's underthings 
 His father beat him but he wouldn't change 
 He ran off with a man one day 
 Now his lingerie's all the rage 
 In the black on every page 
 His father proudly calls his name 
 Down there in the Reeperbahn 
 Now if you've lost your inheritance 
 And all you've left is common sense 
 And you're not too picky about the crowd you keep 
 Or the mattress where you sleep 
 Behind every window, behind every door 
 The apple is gone but there's always the core 
 And the seeds will sprout up right through the floor 
 Down there in the Reeperbahn 
 Down there in the ReeperbahnWell I pulled on trouble's braids 
 And I hid in the briars 
 Out by the quick mud 
 Stayin' away from the main roads 
 Passin' out wolf tickets 
 Downwind from the blood hounds 
 And I pulled on trouble's braids 
 And I lay by a cypress 
 As quiet as a stone 
 Till the bleeding stopped 
 I blew the weather vane 
 Off some old road house 
 I build a fire in the 
 Skeleton back seat of an old Tucker 
 And I pulled on trouble's braids 
 I spanked cold red mud 
 Where the hornet stung deep 
 And I tossed in the ditch 
 In a restless sleep 
 And I pulled on trouble's braids 
 I hung my rain-soaked jacket 
 On some old barbed wire 
 Poured cold rusty water 
 On a miserable fire 
 I pulled on trouble's braids 
 The creek was swollen by daybreak and I could just 
 Barely see 
 And I floated downstream 
 On an old dead tree 
 And I pulled on trouble's braids 
 I pulled on trouble's braids 
 I pulled on trouble's braids 
 I pulled on trouble's braidsCold was the night, and hard was the ground 
 They found her in a small grove of trees 
 Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found 
 She's too young to be out 
 On the street. 
 Why wasn't God watching? 
 Why wasn't God listening? 
 Why wasn't God there for 
 Georgia Lee? 
 Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia 
 From dropping out of school 
 I was doing the best that I could 
 But she kept runnin' away from this world 
 These children are so hard to raise good 
 Why wasn't God watching? 
 Why wasn't God listening? 
 Why wasn't God there for 
 Georgia Lee? 
 Close your eyes and count to ten 
 I will go and hide but then 
 Be sure to find me. I want you to find me 
 And we'll play all over 
 We will play all over again 
 There's a toad in the witch grass 
 There's a crow in the corn 
 Wild flowers on a cross by the road 
 And somewhere a baby is crying 
 For her mom 
 As the hills turn from green back 
 To gold 
 Why wasn't God watching? 
 Why wasn't God listening? 
 Why wasn't God there for 
 Georgia Lee?(Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan) 
 There's a crooked street in Houston town, 
 It's a well worn path I've followed down 
 Now, there's ruin in my name 
 I wish Id never got off the train, 
 I wished I'd listened to the words you said. 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 You'll be lost and never found 
 You can never turn around 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Once I held you in my arms I was sure 
 Till I took that silent stare through the gilded door 
 But the desire to have much more 
 All the glitter and the roar 
 Now I know this is where the sidewalk ends. 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 You'll be lost and never found 
 You can never turn around 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 When I was young I thought only of getting out 
 I said good-bye to my street, good-bye to my house 
 Give a man gin, give a man cards 
 Give an inch, he takes a yard 
 And I rue the day that I stepped off this train. 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street 
 You'll be lost and never found 
 You can never turn around 
 Don't go down to Fannin Street.Woah I, know I've been changed 
 And I know I've been changed 
 I know I've been changed 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Well, I know I got religion, 
 Lord knows I'm not ashamed 
 Well, a holy ghost is my witness 
 And the angels done sign my name 
 Oh, I said: I know I've been changed 
 And I know I've been changed, yeah 
 Know I've been changed 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Lord knows I've been converted 
 Lord knows I've been redeemed 
 Well, you can wake me up in the midnight hour 
 I'm gonna tell ya just a what I seen 
 I said: I know I've been changed 
 And I know I've been changed, yeah 
 Know I've been changed 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Angels in heaven done sign my name 
 Angels in heaven done sign my nameWell there's one thing you can't lose 
 It's that feel 
 Your pants, your shirt, your shoes 
 But not that feel 
 You can throw it out in the rain, you can whip it like a dog 
 You can chop it down like an old dead tree 
 You can always see it when you're coming into town 
 Once you hang it on the wall you can never take it down 
 But there's one thing you can't lose 
 And it's that feel 
 You can pawn your watch and chain 
 But not that feel 
 It always comes and finds you, it will always hear you cry 
 I cross my wooden leg and I swear on my glass eye 
 It will never leave you high and dry, never leave you loose 
 It's harder to get rid of than tattoos 
 But there's one thing you can't lose 
 It's that feel 
 There's one thing you can't lose 
 It's that feel 
 You can throw it off a bridge, you can lose it in the fire 
 You can leave it at the altar, it will make you out a liar 
 You can fall down in the street, you can leave it in the lurch 
 Well, you say that it's gospel but I know that it's only church 
 And there's one thing you can't lose 
 And it's that feel 
 It's that feelI always play Russian Roulette in my head 
 It's sventeen black and twenty-nine red 
 How far from the gutter 
 How far fron the pew 
 I'll always remember to forget about you 
 A good man's is hard to find 
 Only strangers sleep in my bed 
 My favorite words are good-bye 
 And my favorite color is red 
 A long dead soldier looks out 
 From the frame 
 No one remembers his war; no one 
 Remembers his name 
 Go out to the meadow; 
 Scare off all the crows 
 It does nothing but rain here, 
 And nothing will grow 
 A good man's is hard to find 
 Only strangers sleep in my bed 
 My favorite words are good-bye 
 And my favorite color is 
 My favorite color is 
 My favorite color is 
 My favorite color is redWell they call me William the pleaser 
 I sold opium fireworks and lead 
 Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers 
 When the shadows get long I'll be dead 
 Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar 
 Skin was as white as a cuttlefish bone 
 I left Texas to follow Lucinda 
 Now I'll never see heaven or home 
 I made a wish on sliver of moonlight 
 A sly grin and a bowl full of stars 
 Like a kid who captures a firefly 
 And leaves it only to die in the jar 
 As I kick at the clouds at my hanging 
 As I swing out over the crowd 
 I will search every face for Lucinda's 
 And she will off with me down to hell 
 I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda 
 The rain returned and so did the wind 
 I cast this burden on the god that's within me 
 I leave this old world and go free 
 The devil dances inside empty pockets 
 But she never wanted money or pearls 
 No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda 
 She wasn't that kind of girl 
 Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda 
 Whoever thought that hell would be so cold 
 I did well for an old tin can sailor 
 But she wanted the bell in my soul 
 I've spoken to God on the mountain 
 And I've swam in the Irish sea 
 I ate fire and drank from the Ganges 
 And I'll beg there for mercy for me 
 I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda 
 The rain returned so did the wind 
 I was standing outside the Whitehorse 
 Oh but I was afraid to go in 
 I heard someone pull the trigger 
 Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again 
 There was a smear of gold in the window 
 And then I was the jewel of her sin 
 They call me William the Pleaser 
 I sold opium, fireworks and lead 
 Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers 
 When the shadows get long I'll be dead 
 Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar 
 Skin as white as a cuttlefish bone 
 I left Texas to follow Lucinda 
 Now I'll never see heaven or home 
 Now I'll never see heaven or homeI got a belly full of you 
 And that Leavenworth stuff 
 Now I'm gonna get out 
 And I'm gonna get tough 
 You been lying to me 
 How could you crawl so low 
 With some gin-soaked boy 
 That you don't know 
 Full a filth of Old Crow 
 You said you goin' to your ma's 
 But where the hell did you go 
 You went and slipped out nights 
 You didn't think that I'd know 
 With some 
 Gin-soaked boy that you don't know 
 Well I would bet you as far 
 As Oklahoma by now 
 The dogs are barking out back 
 And you're knittin' your brow 
 Well I'm on your tail I sussed your M.O 
 From some gin-soaked boy 
 Boy that you don't knowUncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon 
 Independent as a hog on ice 
 He's a big shot down there at the slaughterhouse 
 Plays accordion for Mr. Weiss 
 Uncle Biltmore and Uncle William 
 Made a million during World War II 
 But they're tightwads and they're cheapskates 
 And they'll never give a dime to you 
 Auntie Mame has gone insane 
 She lives in the doorway of an old hotel 
 And the radio is playing opera 
 All she ever says is "go to hell" 
 Uncle Violet flew as pilot 
 And there ain't no pretty girls in France 
 Now he runs a tiny little bookie joint 
 They say he never keeps it in his pants 
 Uncle Bill will never leave a will 
 And the tumor is as big as an egg 
 He has a mistress, she's Puerto Rican 
 And I heard she has a wooden leg 
 Uncle Phil can't live without his pills 
 He has emphysema and he's almost blind 
 And we must find out where the money is 
 Get it now before he loses his mind 
 Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon 
 Independent as a hog on ice 
 He's a big shot down there at the slaughterhouse 
 He plays accordion for Mr. WeissLet's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town 
 Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down 
 You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie 
 We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky 
 All your scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away 
 Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day 
 Our love needs a transfusion, let's shoot it full of wine 
 Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line 
 So, let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town 
 Set 'em up, set 'em up, we'll be knockin' 'em down 
 You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie 
 We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy skyThe ribbon round your neck 
 Against your skin that's pale as bone 
 It is my favorite thing you've worn 
 The band is playing our song 
 And we won't go home, 'til mornThe seeds are planted here 
 But they won't grow 
 We won't have to say goodbye 
 If we all go 
 Maybe things will be better in Chicago 
 To leave all we've ever known 
 For a place we've never seen 
 Maybe things will be better in Chicago 
 Well it's braver to stay 
 Even braver to go 
 Wherever she goes, I go 
 Maybe things will be better in Chicago 
 What we need, the Lord will give us 
 All we want, we carry with us 
 You know where I can be found 
 Where the rainbow hits the ground 
 I'm not alone 
 I'm not afraid 
 'Cause this bird has flown from his cage 
 There's so much magic we have known 
 On this sapphire we call home 
 With my coat and my hat 
 I'll say goodbye to all that 
 Maybe things will be better in Chicago 
 Maybe things will be better in Chicago 
 Chicago

 All aboard 
 All aboardWell, my mama didn't want me 
 On the day I was born 
 I was born without a body 
 I got nothing but scorn 
 But I always loved music 
 All I had was my hands 
 I dreamed I'd be famous 
 And I'd work at the Sands 
 Singing Table Top Joe 
 Table Top Joe 
 Now everyone knows 
 I'm Table Top Joe 
 I had trouble with the pedals 
 But I had a strong left hand 
 And I could play Stravinsky 
 On a baby grand 
 I said I'm gonna join the circus 
 Cause that's where I belong 
 So I went to Coney Island 
 I was singing this song 
 Table Top Joe 
 Table Top Joe 
 Now everyone knows 
 Table Top Joe 
 They gave me top billing 
 In the Dreamland show 
 I had my own orchestra 
 Starring Table Top Joe 
 And the man without a body 
 Proved everyone wrong 
 I was rich and I was famous 
 I was where I belonged, yeah 
 Table Top Joe 
 Table Top Joe 
 Now everyone knows 
 Table Top Joe 
 Take it home, boysInside a broken clock 
 Splashing the wine with all the rain dogs 
 Taxi, we'd rather walk, huddle a doorway with the rain dogs 
 For I am a rain dog too 
 Oh, we danced and we swallowed the night 
 For it was all ripe for dreaming 
 Oh, how we danced away all of the lights 
 We've always been out of our minds 
 The rum pours strong and thin 
 Beat out the dustman with the rain dogs 
 Aboard a shipwreck train, give my umbrella to the rain dogs 
 For I am a rain dog too 
 Oh, how we danced with the Rose of Tralee 
 Her long hair black as a raven 
 Oh, how we danced and you whispered to me 
 You'll never be going back home 
 Oh, how we danced with the Rose of Tralee 
 Her long hair black as a raven 
 Oh, how we danced and you whispered to me 
 You'll never be going back homeI'll tip the newsboy 
 I'll get a shine 
 I'll ride this dream 
 To the end of the line 
 I'm goin' places 
 I'll take a ride 
 Up to the Riverside 
 I'll take NY 
 I'll let it happen 
 I'll pop the cork 
 Tear off the wrappin' 
 I'll make a splash on the Hudson 
 That's how I will arrive 
 Hey, do you have two tens for a five? 
 Roll out the carpet 
 Strike up the band 
 Break into the best 
 Champagne when I land 
 Beat the parade drum 
 Hit all the bars 
 I want the moon and stars 
 But I'll take NY 
 I'll make it happen 
 Blow out the candlels 
 Tear off the wrappin' 
 And I know someday 
 They'll have to name a street after me 
 Right next door to old Franklin DHey Charley, I'm pregnant 
 Living on 9th Street 
 Right above a dirty bookstore 
 Off Euclid Avenue 
 I stopped taking dope 
 I quit drinking whiskey 
 My old man plays the trombone 
 Works out at the track 
 He says that he loves me 
 Even though it's not his baby 
 He says that he'll raise him up 
 Like he would his own son 
 He gave me a ring 
 That was worn by his mother 
 And he takes me out dancin' 
 Every Saturday night 
 Hey Charley, I think about you 
 Every time I pass a filling station 
 On account of all the grease 
 You used to wear in your hair 
 I still have that record 
 Little Anthony & the Imperials 
 But someone stole my record player 
 Well, how do you like that? 
 Hey Charley, I almost went crazy 
 After Mario got busted 
 I went back to Omaha 
 To live with my folks 
 Everyone I used to know 
 Is either dead or in prison 
 So I came back to Minneapolis 
 This time I think I'm gonna stay 
 Hey Charley, I think I'm happy 
 For the first time since my accident 
 I wish I had all the money 
 We used to spend on dope 
 I'd buy me a used car lot 
 And I wouldn't sell any of 'em 
 I'd just drive a different car every day 
 Dependin' on how I feel 
 Hey Charley, for chrissakes 
 If you want to know the truth of it 
 I don't have a husband 
 He don't play the trombone 
 I need to borrow money 
 To pay this lawyer 
 And Charley, hey 
 I'll be eligible for parole 
 Come Valentine's DayFalling James in the Tahoe mud 
 Stick around to tell us all the tale 
 Well, he fell in love with a Gun Street girl 
 And now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail 
 Dancing in the Birmingham jail 
 Took a a hundred dollars off of slaughterhouse Joe 
 Bought a brand new Michigan 20 gauge 
 He got all liquored up on that road house corn 
 Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette 
 A hole in the hood of a yellow corvette 
 He bought a second hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese 
 And dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco 
 With a pawnshop radio, quarter past four 
 He left Waukegan at the slamming of the door 
 Left Waukegan at the slamming of the door 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home 
 Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood 
 Soaking day old bread in kerosene 
 Well, he was blue as a robin's egg and brown as a hog 
 He stayed out of circulation till the dogs get tired 
 Out of circulation till the dogs get tired 
 Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone 
 He never get up in the morning on a Saturday 
 Sitting by the Erie with a bull whipped dog 
 Telling everyone he saw, "They went thatta way, boss" 
 Telling everyone he saw, "They went thatta way" 
 Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof 
 Burlington Northern pulling out of the world 
 Now a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw 
 And a Gun Street girl was the cause of it all 
 A Gun Street girl was the cause of it all 
 Riding in the shadow by the St. Joe Ridge 
 And the click clack tapping of a blind man's cane 
 He was pulling into Baker on a New Year's Eve 
 One eye on the pistol and the other on the door 
 One eye on the pistol and the other on the door 
 Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row 
 Smuggled in a brand new pair of alligator shoes 
 With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair 
 Well, they tired her to a tree with a skinny millionaire 
 Tired her to a tree with a skinny millionaire 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home 
 Banging on a table with an old tin cup 
 Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again 
 Never kiss a Gun Street girl again 
 I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home 
 I said John, John, he's long gone 
 Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming homeShe was a middle class girl 
 She was in over her head 
 She thought she could stand up in the deep end 
 He had a bullet proof smile 
 He had money to burn 
 She thought she had the moon in her pocket 
 But now she's dead 
 She's so dead 
 Forever dead and lovely now 
 I've always been told to remember this 
 Don't let a fool kiss you, never marry for love 
 He was hard to impress 
 He knew everyone's secrets 
 He wore her on his arm just like jewelry 
 He never gave but he got 
 He kept her on a leash 
 He's not the kind of wheel you fall asleep at 
 But now she's dead 
 Forever dead 
 Forever dead and lovely now 
 Come closer 
 Look deeper 
 You're falling fast 
 Just like a plane on a stormy sea 
 She made up someone to be 
 She made up somewhere to be from 
 This is one business in the world where there's no problem at all 
 Everything that is left 
 They will only plow under 
 Soon every one you knew will be gone 
 And now she's dead 
 Forever dead 
 Forever dead and lovely now 
 But now she's dead 
 Forever dead 
 Forever dead and lovely now 
 I, I've always been told to remember this 
 Don't let a kiss fool you, never marry for love 
 Everything has it's price 
 Everything has it's place 
 What's more romantic than dying in the moonlight? 
 Now they're all watching the sea 
 What's lost can never be broken 
 Her roots were sweet but they were so shallow 
 And now she's dead 
 Forever dead 
 Forever dead and lovely now 
 And now she's dead 
 Forever dead 
 And she's so dead and lovely nowHang on St. Christopher through the smoke and the oil

 Mornin Mr. Furgeson, what's the good word witcha 
 Stayin' outta trouble like a good boy should 
 I see you're still cuttin hair, I'm still cuttin' classes 
 Got a couple of passes to the Ring Brothers Barn Bail circus afternoon 
 You lost a little 'round the middle you're lookin' reel good 
 Sittin' on the wagon 'stead of under the hood 
 What's the low down Mr. Brown 
 I heard your boy's leavin' town 
 I bought myself a struggle buggy suckers powder blue 
 Throw me over sports page, Cincinnati's lookin' good 
 Always been for Pittsburgh and I'll lay you 10 to 1 
 Pirates get the pennant and the series 'fore they're done 
 The hair's gettin' longer, you know the skirts gettin' shorter 
 And you can get a cheaper haircut if you wanna cross the border 
 If your mama saw you smokin' bet she'd kick your ass 
 Put it out, you juvenile, and put it out fast 
 Well, if I had a million dollars, what would I do 
 Probably be a barber, not a bum like you 
 Still got your paper route and that's just fine 
 Now you can pay me double 'cause you gypped me last time 
 Don'tcha know that you can keep a little circus money and spend it on a girl 
 And just remember that I give the best haircuts in the whole wide world

 With an arm full of box cars 
 On the wings of a magpie 
 Cross a hooligan night 
 I busted up a chifforobe 
 Way out by the cocomo 
 Cooked up a mess a mulligan 
 And got into a fight 
 Whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 A mean Mother Hubbard 
 Papa One-Eyed Jack 
 You probably seen me sleepin' 
 Out by the railroad tracks 
 Go on and ask the Prince Of Darkness 
 What about all that smoke 
 Come from the stack 
 Sometimes I kill myself a jackel 
 Suck out all the blood 
 Steal myself a stationwagon 
 Drivin' through the mud 
 I want to whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 I'm mean Mother Hubbard Papa One-Eyed Jack 
 I know you seen my headlights 
 And the honkin' of my horn 
 I'm callin' out my bloodhounds 
 Chase the devil through the corn 
 Last night I chugged the Mississippi 
 Now that suckers dry as a bone 
 I'm born in a taxi cab 
 I'm never goin' home 
 Whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 I'm mean Mother Hubbard 
 Papa One-Eyed Jack 
 My eyes have seen the glory 
 Of the drainin' of the ditch 
 I only come to Baton Rouge 
 I gotta find myself a witch 
 I'm-on a snatch me up a 
 Couple of 'em every time it rains 
 You see a locomotive 
 Probably thinkin' it's a train 
 Whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 I'm a mean Mother Hubbard 
 Papa One-Eyed Jack 
 What you think is the sunshine 
 Is just a twinkle in my eye 
 And the ring around my finger 
 Called the 4th of July 
 When I get a little bit lonesome 
 And a tear falls from my check 
 There's gonna be an ocean in 
 The middle of the week 
 Whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 Mean Mother Hubbard 
 Papa One-Eyed Jack 
 Come into town on a night train 
 Arm full of box cars 
 On the wings of a magpie 
 Cross a hooligan night 
 I'm gona tear me off a rainbow 
 And wear it for a tie 
 I never told the truth 
 So I can never tell a lie 
 Whistlin' past the graveyard 
 Steppin' on a crack 
 A mean Mother Hubbard 
 Papa One-Eyed JackA window left open 
 And the pillow's soaking wet 
 Who says love ever comes without tolls 
 She sends no kindness 
 No words of regret 
 When she put the fork in the road 
 There's a ring with a diamond missing 
 It was lost in the backseat of a car 
 There's a dollar on the floor in the kitchen 
 Christmas lights blinking on a long dead tree in the parlor 
 Cheaters never prosper, cheaters never win 
 Cheaters never prosper, cheaters never win

 Long hair, big eyes 
 And she always needs money 
 Did I find her? 
 Or was she the one who chose? 
 I wanna drown 
 Like a fly in the honey 
 And she stole the blush 
 From the rose 
 Long hair, big eyes 
 And she always needs money

 Don't worry about the army in the cold, cold ground 
 Cold, cold ground 
 Cold, cold ground 
 Cold, cold ground 
 Now don't be a cry baby when there's wood in the shed 
 There's a bird in the chimmney and a stone in my bed 
 When the road's washed out, they pass the bottle around 
 And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 There's a ribbon in the willow, there's a tire swing rope 
 And a briar patch of berries taking over the slope 
 The cat'll sleep in the mailbox, and we'll never go to town 
 'Til we bury every dream in the cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells 
 Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill 
 The piano is firewood, Times Square is a dream 
 I find we'll lay down together in the cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 The cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 Call the cops on the Breedloves, bring a Bible and a rope 
 And a whole box of rebel and a bar of soap 
 Make a pile of trunk tires and burn 'em all down 
 Bring a dollar with you, baby, in the cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 In the cold, cold ground 
 Take the weathervane rooster, throw rocks at his head 
 Stop talking to the neighbors until we all go dead

 And they heard his tale 
 Of a world that was so far away 
 And a song that we'd never heard 
 A song of a little bird 
 That fell in love with a whale 
 He said, "You cannot live in the ocean." 
 And she said to him, 
 "You never can live in the sky." 
 But the ocean is filled with tears 
 And the sea turns into a mirror 
 There's a whale in the moon when it's clear 
 And a bird on the tide 
 Oh, please don't cry 
 Let me dry your eyes 
 So tell me that you will wait for me 
 Hold me in your arms 
 I promise we never will part 
 I'll never sail back to the time 
 But I'll always pretend you're mine 
 Though I know we both must part 
 You can live in my heart

 You can see a million of 'em on heartattack and vine

 What you say you meet me down on heartattack and vineI grew up here all of my life 
 But I dreamed someday I'd go 
 Where the blue-eyed girls and red guitars 
 And the naked rivers flow 
 Now I'm not all I thought I'd be 
 I've always stayed around 
 I've been as far as Mercy and Grand 
 Frozen to the ground 
 I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave 
 So kiss me once and then 
 I'll go to hell, I might as well 
 Be whistling down the wind 
 Bus is at the corner 
 The clock on the wall 
 Broken down windmill 
 Ain't no wind at all 
 I yelled and I cursed 
 If I stay here I'll rust 
 I'm stuck like a shipwreck 
 Out here in the dust 
 Sky is red and the world is on fire 
 And the corn is taller than me 
 And the dog is tied to a wagon of rain 
 And the road is wet as the sea 
 Sometimes the music from a dance 
 Will carry across the plains 
 And the places that I'm dreaming of 
 Do they dream only of me? 
 There are places where they never sleep 
 And the circus never ends 
 So I will take the Marley Bone coach 
 And be whistling down the wind 
 So I will take the Marley Bone coach 
 And be whistling down the windDream away the tears in your eyes 
 Dream away your sorrows 
 Dream away all your goodbyes 
 Dream away tomorrow 
 I promise when the sun comes up 
 I promise I'll be true 
 And just like before the band starts to play 
 They always play your favorite tune 
 And dream awawy when everyone's gone 
 Dream away your grey skies tooo 
 Dream away and nothing is wrong 
 Dreams have wishes that are waiting for you 
 And up ahead the road is turning 
 Turning for you and me 
 And just like before 
 The band starts to play 
 Now there's that twinkle in your eye 
 And dream awayI've seen it all, boys -- 
 I've been all over. 
 Been everywhere in the whole wide world. 
 I rode the high line with ol' Blind Darby. 
 I danced real slow with Ida Jane. 
 I was full of wonder when I left Murfreesboro -- 
 Now I am full of hollow on Maxwell street. 
 And I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 Knows the way back home. 
 I walked from Nachez to Hushpukena -- 
 I built a fire by the side of the road. 
 I worked for nothing in a Belzoni saw mill. 
 I caught a blind out on the B and O 
 Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so 
 A 44'll get you 99. 
 And I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 Knows the way back home. 
 I run my race with burnt face Jake -- 
 Gave him a Manzanita cross. 
 I lived on nothing but dreams and train smoke 
 Somehow my watch and chain got lost. 
 I wish I was home in Evelyn's kitchen 
 With old Gyp curled around my feet. 
 And I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 I hope my pony 
 Knows the way back home.Don't go to church on Sunday 
 Don't get on my knees to pray 
 Don't memorize the books of the Bible 
 I got my own special way 
 But I know Jesus loves me 
 Maybe just a little bit more 
 I fall out on my knees every Sunday 
 At Zerelda Lee's candy store 
 Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Make me feel good inside 
 Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Keep me satisfied 
 Well I don't want no Abba Zabba 
 Don't want no Almond Joy 
 There ain't nothing better 
 Suitable for this boy 
 Well it's the only thing 
 That can pick me up 
 Better than a cup of gold 
 See only a chocolate Jesus 
 Can satisfy my soul 
 (Solo) 
 When the weather gets rough 
 And it's whiskey in the shade 
 It's best to wrap your savior 
 Up in cellophane 
 He flows like the big muddy 
 But that's ok 
 Pour him over ice cream 
 For a nice parfait 
 Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Good enough for me 
 Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Good enough for me 
 Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Make me feel good inside 
 Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
 Keep me satisfiedEverything you can think of is true 
 Before the ocean was blue 
 We were lost in a flood 
 Run red with your blood 
 Nigerian skeleton crew 
 Everything you can think of is true 
 The dish ran away with the spoon 
 Dig deep in your heart 
 For that little red glow 
 We're decomposing as we go 
 Everything you can think of is true 
 And fishes make wishes on you 
 We're fighting our way 
 Up dreamland's spine 
 Red flamingos and expensive wine 
 Everything you can think of is true 
 The baby's asleep in your shoe 
 Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors 
 Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore 
 HaBroken glass, rusty nails 
 Where the wild violets grow 
 Say goodbye to the railroad, the mad dogs of summer 
 And everything that I know 
 What some men will do here for diamonds 
 What some men will do here for gold 
 They're wounded but they just keep on climbing 
 And sleep by the side of the road 
 There's a hole in the ladder, a fence we can climb 
 Mad as a hatter, you're thin as a dime 
 Go out to the meadow, the hills are a-green 
 Sing me a rainbow, steal me a dream 
 Small-time Napoleon's shattered his knees 
 But he stays in the saddle for Rose 
 And all his disciples, they shave in the gutter 
 And they gather what's left of his clothes 
 What some men will do here for diamonds 
 What some men will do here for gold 
 They're wounded but they just keep on climbing 
 And sleep by the side of the roadHe went down down down 
 And the devil called him by name 
 He went down down down 
 Hangin' onto the back of a train 
 He went down down down 
 This boy went solid down 
 Always chewed tobacco 
 And the bathtub gin 
 Always chewed tobacco 
 And the bathtub gin 
 He went down down down 
 This boy went solid down 
 He went down 
 Well he went down down down 
 And the jumped on his head 
 He went down down down 
 Stayin' in a broken down shed 
 He went down down down 
 Sleepin' in the devil's bed 
 He went down down down 
 Never listened to the words I said 
 He went down down down down 
 He went down 
 Well he went down down down 
 And the devil said where you been 
 He went down down down 
 He screamin' down around the bend 
 Down down down 
 This boy went solid down 
 He was always cheatin' 
 And he always told lies 
 He was always cheatin' 
 And he always told lies 
 He went down down down 
 Down down down 
 This boy went solid down 
 He went down(Tom Waits)

 At the Fledderjohns' Lodge

 While she's hanging out her clothes

 I ain't allowed 
 No, I ain't allowed

 In Buzz Fledderjohn's yard.

 Sinners in the pew 
 The weather vane squeaking to the west

 And the deepest oceans blue

 'Cause I ain't allowed 
 No, I ain't allowed 
 No, I ain't allowed

 They all know how to kick it in Cal 
 They're playing this dope and this-a money tune 
 Dancing baby with a 7 mile broom 
 Things are bulging out the rafters like hell 
 Down there at the Hush Hotel 
 They're jumping right out of their seats, 
 Dancing to the bran' new beat

 Do the Metropolitan Glide 
 The floor is polished and your momma's gone 
 You can quake and roll and moan 
 29 gypsies in a Cadillac stoned 
 Turn off the ringer on your cellular phone 
 Whip the air like a Rainbow Trout 
 Drag your tail pipe till you bottom out

 The low bottom of the China moon 
 The black swan and the way too soon 
 Ace pocket and the dog bone gone 
 The peacock and the mean black swan 
 The rain shower and high heeled shoe 
 Bombay money and I know I can do it 
 The sink hole and the victory dance 
 It's in the pocket in the real tight pants

 Hey! 
 The Metropolitan! 
 The Metropolitan! 
 Show your teeth, bray like a calf 
 You kill me with your machine gun laugh 
 You make me trouble with the floor that's creaking 
 I've been ready to ka-boom for a week 
 Put on your stockings and your powder and blush 
 Keep it all on the hush, hush, hush

 Hush-a-bye, my baby, no need to be crying 
 You can burn the midnight oil with me as long as you will 
 Stare out at the moon upon the windowsill 
 And dream 
 Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye 
 Hush-a-bye, my baby, no need to be crying 
 There's dew drops on the windowsill, gumdrops in your head 
 Slipping into dream land, you're nodding your head 
 So dream 
 Dream of West Virginia or of the British Isles 
 'Cause when you are dreaming, you see for miles and miles 
 When you are much older, remember when we sat 
 At midnight on the windowsill and had this little chat 
 And dream 
 Come on and dream 
 Come on and dream 
 And dream 
 And dream 
 Come on, dreamThe things a crow puts in his nest, 
 They are always things he finds that shine 
 Best 
 And how he'll find a shiny dime a silver 
 Twine 
 From a valentine. 
 The crows all bring them shiny things. 
 Leave me alone you big ol' moon, 
 The light you cast is just a lir. 
 You're like the crows, 'cause if it glows, 
 You're dressed to go, you guessed I know, 
 You'll always cling to shiny things. 
 Well I'm not dancing here tonight, 
 But things are bound to turn around. 
 Though the only thing I want that shines is to be 
 King 
 Here in your eyes. 
 To be your only shiny thing.Stop and get me on the ride up (uh-huh-huh)

 Ha ha ha ha ha!I fell asleep down by the stream 
 And there I had the strangest dream 
 And down by Brennan's Glen there grows 
 A briar and a rose 
 There's a tree in a forest 
 But I don't know where 
 And I built a nest out of your hair 
 And climbing up into the air 
 A briar and a rose 
 I don't know how long it has been 
 But I was born in Brennan's Glen 
 And near the end of spring there grows 
 A briar and a rose 
 I picked the rose one early morn 
 I pricked my finger on a thorn 
 It'd grown so close that it winding wove 
 The briar around the rose 
 I tried to tear them both apart 
 I felt a bullet in my heart 
 All dressed up in spring's new clothes 
 The briar and the rose 
 When I'm buried in my grave 
 Tell me so I will know 
 Your tears will fall 
 To make love grow 
 The briar and the rose 
 And when I'm buried in my grave 
 Tell me so I will know 
 Your tears will fall 
 To make love grow 
 The briar and the rose 
 Your tears will fall 
 To make hell grow 
 The briar and the roseLicorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue 
 Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town 
 Took the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks 
 And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through 
 He's a juvenile delinquent, never learned how to behave 
 But the cops would never think to look in Burma-Shave 
 And the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone 
 He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known 
 He kinda looked like Farley Granger with his hair slicked back 
 She says, "I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat. 
 How far are you going?" He said, "Depends on what you mean." 
 He says, "I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline. 
 I guess I'm going that way just as long as it's paved. 
 I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma-Shave." 
 And with her knees up on the glove compartment 
 She took out her barrettes 
 And her hair spilled out like root beer 
 And she popped her gum and arched her back 
 Hell, Marysville ain't nothing 
 But a wide spot in the road 
 Some nights my heart pounds just like thunder 
 Don't know why it don't explode 
 'Cause everyone in this stinking town has got one foot in the grave 
 And I'd rather take my chances out in Burma-Shave 
 Presley's what I go by, why don't you change the station 
 Count the grain elevators in the rear view mirror 
 She said, "Mister anywhere you point this thing 
 Has got to beat the hell out of the sting 
 Of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin'. 
 And so drill me a hole with a barber pole 
 I'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight 
 Why don't you have another swig 
 And pass that car if you're so brave 
 I wanna get there before the sun comes up in Burma-Shave." 
 And the spiderweb crack and the mustang screamed 
 Smoke from the tires and the twisted machine 
 Just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved 
 Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma-Shave 
 And the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow 
 Up against the car door on the shotgun side 
 And when they pulled her from the wreck 
 You know she still had on her shades 
 They say that dreams are growing wild just this side of Burma-ShaveLay your head where my heart used to be 
 Hold the earth above me 
 Lay down in the green grass 
 Remember when you loved me 
 Stand beneath a rainy sky 
 The moon is over the rise 
 Think of me as a train goes by 
 Clear the thistles and brambles 
 Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble' 
 Now there's a bubble of me 
 And it's floating in thee 
 Stand in the shade of me 
 Things are now made of me 
 The weather vane will say... 
 It smells like rain today 
 God took the stars and he tossed 'em 
 Can't tell the birds from the blossoms 
 You'll never be free of me 
 He'll make a tree from me 
 Don't say good bye to me 
 Describe the sky to me 
 And if the sky falls, mark my words 
 We'll catch mocking birds 
 Lay your head where my heart used to be 
 Hold the earth above me 
 Lay down in the green grass 
 Remember when you loved meIt's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight 
 It's more than thunder it's more than thunder 
 And its more than a bad dream, now that I'm sober 
 It's more than a swindle this crooked card game 
 Nothing but sad times, Nothing but sad times 
 None of our pockets are filled with gold 
 Nobody's caught the boquet 
 There are no dead presidents we can fold 
 Nothing is going our way 
 And its more than trouble, I got myself into 
 It's more than woe-be-gotten grey skies now 
 And its more than a bad dream, now that I'm sober 
 There's no more dancing, there is no more dancing 
 And its more than trouble, I got myself into 
 Nothing but sad times, Nothing but sad times 
 And it's more than goodbye I have to say to you 
 It's more than woe-be-gotten grey skies nowI'm on a black elevator goin' down 
 Little Joe from Kokomo, it rattles to the ground 
 The dice is laughin' at the man that he throwed 
 Your rollin' over to the low side of the road 
 The moon is red and your dancin' real slow 
 Twenty nine miles left to go 
 The chain monkeys help you with your load 
 You're rollin' over to the low side of the road 
 Jezebel is naked with an axe 
 The prosecution tell you to relax 
 Your head feels like it's ready to explode 
 You're rollin' over, you're rollin' over 
 Jezebel is naked with an axe 
 The prosecution tell you to relax 
 Your head feels like it's ready to explode 
 You're rollin' over, you're rollin' over 
 The clapper has been ripped o ut of the bell 
 The flapper has been kicked right o ut of hell 
 When the horse whips the man that he rode 
 You're rollin' over to the low side of the road 
 The dog won't bite if you beat him with a bone 
 She's so shy when she's talkin' on the phone 
 The ground rises up and starts to groan 
 You're rollin' over to the low side of the roadI'm the last leaf on the tree 
 The autumn took the rest 
 But they won't take me 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 When the autumn wind blows 
 They're already gone 
 They flutter to the ground 
 'Cause they can't hang on 
 There's nothing in the world 
 That I ain’t seen 
 I greet all the new ones 
 That are coming in green 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 The autumn took the rest 
 But they won't take me 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 They say I got staying power 
 Here on the tree 
 But I've been here since Eisenhower 
 And I've out lived even he 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 The autumn took the rest 
 But they won’t take me 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 I fight off the snow 
 I fight off the hail 
 Nothing makes me go 
 I'm like some vestigial tail 
 I'll be here through eternity 
 If you want to know how long 
 If they cut down this tree 
 I'll show up in a song 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 The autumn took the rest 
 But they won't take me 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 I'm the last leaf on the tree 
 I'm the last leaf on the treeThanks, uh... You know uh, this is weird uh... 
 Most of us have dogs, all right? (applause) 
 I don't know if it's a local thing where I live, or if it's everywhere, and I'm checking it with you because uh, I don't get in the area that often and I'm just checking to see if... 
 There's a new kind of a dog treat. And uh (where I live) and they're available in the pet store and for the longest time I just thought that it was some kind of a prank. Or uh... 
 I wasn't really sure what it was, until I read the label on the back and it said "Bull Penis" (laughter). 
 I was a little shocked! I know you can get just about ANYTHING in this world. 
 You can get a whale's pancreas if you'd want one! I can get you one! (laughter) 
 But com'on, a bull's penis! How busy they were their whole lives. 
 And they throw it to a dog, like that, for a snack! (laughter) 
 Now, are they available here in the Los Angeles area? They are, aren't they? 
 Doesn't that make you a little weazy? 
 Makes you wanna live a long time. 
 And on the back, on the bottom it said: "100% natural"! 
 I mean... that's the part that really got me. And it said: "A Real Meat Snack". 
 There's just no dignity in that. Uh, anyway... 
 The other thing is that they're 36 inches long! (laughter). 
 They're so long they had to cut them into bite-size portions. 
 And then they take two of them and braid them together. 
 I know, I know! I never want it done. But uh... 
 This is a song written for Gregory Peck for his dating my mom... 
 That's a lie!Not much chance, completely cut loose from purpose, 
 He was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to somewhere. 
 And it began to snow. 
 And the bus stopped at a little cafe in the hills and the passengers entered. 
 And he sat at the counter with the others, and he ordered, the food arrived. 
 And the meal was particularly good, and the coffee. 
 The waitress was unlike the women he had known. 
 She was unaffected, and there was a natural humor which came from her. 
 And the fry cook said crazy things and the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh. 
 And the young man watched the snow through the window. 
 And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever. 
 The curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there and it would always stay beautiful there. 
 And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board. 
 And the young man thought "I'll just stay here, I'll just stay here" 
 And then he rose and he followed the others into the bus. 
 He found his seat and looked at the cafe through the window and then the bus moved off, down a curve, downward, out of the hills. 
 And the young man looked straight forward. 
 And he heard the other passengers speaking of other things, 
 Or they were reading or trying to sleep. 
 And they hadn't noticed the magic. 
 And the young man put his head to one side, closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep. 
 There was nothing else to do, just to listen to the sound of the engine, and the sound of the tires, in the snow.Ladies and Gentlemen,

 There's a place I know where the train goes slow 
 Where the sinners can be washed in the blood of the lamb 
 There's a river by the trestle down by Sinner's Grove 
 Down where the willow and the dogwood grows 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow 
 You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell 
 From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell 
 And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time 
 You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow 
 There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist 
 And I know that your name will be on that list 
 There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth 
 I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow 
 So if you live in darkness and if you live in shame 
 All of the passengers will be treated the same 
 And old Humpty Jackson and Gyp the Blood will sing 
 And Charlie Witman is holding on to Dillinger's wings 
 They're down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow 
 If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith 
 I know you will be cared for and I know you will be safe 
 And all of the shameful and all of the whores 
 And even the soldier who pierced the heart of the Lord 
 Is down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow 
 Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer 
 Never given of myself, never truly cared 
 I've hurt the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain 
 I've taken the low road and if you've done the same 
 Meet me down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slowAnd if I have to go 
 Will you remember me? 
 Or will you find someone else 
 While I'm away? 
 There's nothing for me 
 In this world full of strangers 
 It's all someone else's idea 
 I don't belong here 
 And you can't go with me 
 You'll only slow me down 
 Until I send for you 
 Don't wear your hair that way 
 And if you cannot be true 
 I'll understand 
 Tell all the others 
 You hold in your arms 
 I said I'd come back for you 
 I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm 
 That's all that I can do 
 And if I have to go 
 Will you remember me? 
 Or will you find someone else 
 While I'm away?Dot King was whittled 
 From the Bone of Cain 
 With a little drop of poison 
 In the red, red blood 
 She needs a way to turn 
 Around the bend 
 She said she wants to walk away 
 And start over again. 
 There are things I done 
 I can't erase 
 I want to look in the mirror 
 And see another face 
 I said never but I'm doin' it again 
 I want to walk away 
 And start over again. 
 No more rain, no more roses 
 I'm on my way, I slake my thirst 
 In a cool, cool pond. 
 There's a winner in every place 
 There's a heart that keeps beating 
 On every page 
 The beginning always 
 Starts at the end 
 You wanna walk away 
 And start over again.

 He has sinned

 In a cool, cool pond. 
 Cooper told Molly the whole block is gone 
 They're dying for jewelry, money, and clothes 
 I always get out of the trouble I'm in 
 I wanna walk away and start over again. 
 Left my bible by the side of the road 
 Carved my initials in an old dead tree 
 I'm going away but I'll be back when 
 It's time to walk away and start over again.I left New York in 1949 
 To go across the country without a bad blame dime

 Found my father in the gambling hall

 Across the Niagara, home I'll never be 
 Home in ol' Medora, home in Ol' Truckee

 Better or for worse, thick and thin

 Just like I love him (just like I love him)

 Just the same for him (just the same for him, yeah)

 For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind 
 If you're young at heart 
 You can go to extremes with impossible schemes 
 You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams 
 And life gets more exciting with each passing day 
 And love is either in your heart or on its way 
 Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth 
 To be young at heart 
 And as rich as you are it's much better by far 
 To be young at heart 
 And if you should survive to 105 
 Think of all you've derived out of being alive 
 Then this is the best part 
 You have a head start 
 If you are among the very young at heart 
 Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth 
 To be young at heart 
 Or as rich as you are it's much better by far 
 To be young at heart

 And I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never comin' home

 And I'm lost 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world 
 I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world. 
 Satchel Puddin' and Lord God Mose 
 Sitting by the fire with a busted nose 
 That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare 
 But the white part is perfect for slickin' down your hair 
 And I'm lost

 I'm lost at the bottom of the world 
 I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world.

 I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world. 
 Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron 
 On Telapia fish cakes and fried black swan 
 Razorweed onion and peacock squirrel 
 And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl 
 And I'm lost 
 And I'm lost 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world 
 I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar 
 I'm lost at the bottom of the world. 
 Well God's green hair is where I slept last 
 He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass 
 Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird 
 And when I wanna talk 
 Hangs on every word

 I've got what I paid for now 
 See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow 
 A couple of bucks from you 
 To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley 
 And I'm tired of all these soldiers here 
 No one speaks English, and everything's broken 
 And my Stacys are soaking wet 
 To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking 
 A lot they can do for me 
 I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open 
 And I'm down on my knees tonight 
 Old Bushmills I staggered, you'd bury the dagger 
 In your silhouette window light 
 To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her 
 And the one-armed bandit knows 
 And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs 
 And the girls down by the striptease shows, go 
 Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say 
 That the streets aren't for dreaming now 
 And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories 
 They want a piece of the action anyhow 
 Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 And you can ask any sailor and the keys from the jailer 
 And the old men in wheelchairs know 
 And Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred 
 And she follows wherever you may go 
 Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda 
 You'll go waltzing Matilda with me 
 And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace 
 And a wound that will never heal 
 No prima donna, the perfume is on 
 An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey 
 And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers 
 And goodnight to Matilda, tooThe smoke from the battle fish and the rain soaked through 
 And the wheelman left the shore 
 And barns tumbled and silos flew across fifteen miles bad road tar 
 And big Bull Trometer hung on to the side 
 And the pig dogs trembled on Spidey's wild ride 
 And big John Jizom from downtown Chizom 
 Flew away with old mrs. Storm 
 And they found Bird Lundy neath a keg of nails crooked as a dog's hind leg 
 Keeping warm after twenty-nine days on hard assed bread 
 He drilled to the big outside and clung like a tick to his waterfront 
 Life mooned and clouded, blued and skied 
 And all the clocks blew up on Spidey's wild ride 
 And the hills stood up in a great big 3 
 And left me whipped by the forces that were inside me 
 Loud as the ocean, cold as a desk, red as the water on the river of flesh 
 And he was sewing up his pants while he was shoeing a mule 
 And he was bucking a head wind gale 
 But the crooked ass beauty was trapped to the side 
 And he shook on Spidey's wild ride 
 And all the statue ass makers, and the uprooted trees 
 And I shouted way up to where the rabbit digs his hole 
 And the wheelman, the jockeys the landlords and thee 
 Were bucking a head wind south 
 And I never did see another day outside 
 'Cause I'd had enough travel on Spidey's wild rideLittle trip to heaven on the wings of your love 
 Banana moon shining in the sky 
 Feel like I'm in heaven when you're with me 
 Know that I'm in heaven when you smile 
 Though we're stuck here on the ground 
 I got something that I've found 
 And it's you 
 I don't have to take no trip to outer space 
 All I have to do is look at your face 
 And before I know it I'm in orbit around you 
 Thanking my lucky stars that I found you 
 When I see your constellation 
 Honey, you're my inspiration 
 And it's you 
 You're my North Star when I'm lost and feeling blue 
 The sun is breaking through the clouds, don't you, don't you know it's true 
 Honey, all the other stars seem dim around you 
 Thanking my lucky stars that I found you 
 When I see your smiling face 
 Honey, I know nothing ever gonna take your place 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 And it's you 
 Zhoo-be-doo-bop-bah-daah(Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan) 
 Well, ring the bell backwards 
 And bury the axe 
 Fall down onto your knees into the dirt 
 I'm tired to the mast, between water and wind 
 Believe me you'll never get hurt 
 Now the ring's into the pawn shit 
 The rains into the hole 
 Down at the fire points I stand 
 I'll lose everything 
 But I 
 never let go of your hand 
 Now Peter denied and Judas betrayed 
 I'll pay with the roll of the drum 
 And the wind will tell the turn from the wheel 
 And the watch man's making me proud 
 Well you leave one hanging by the skin of my teeth 
 I've only got one leg to stand 
 You can send me to hell 
 But won't let go of your hand 
 Swing from the rope onto a cross legged dream 
 Signed with the one-eyed jack's blood 
 From Temple and Union to Weyley and Grand 
 Walking back home into the mud 
 Now I must make my best 
 Of the only way home 
 Molly deals only in stones 
 I'm lost onto the mid way 
 I'm reckless into your eyes 
 Just give me a couple more throughs 
 I'll dare you to dine with the 
 Cross legged knights 
 Gimme to jump and I will 
 I'll fall from your grace 
 But I'll never let go of your hand 
 I'll never let go of your handShe's a crooked sheriff in a real straight town 
 She opened the door shake shake the lights go down 
 Clover honey and the Jimson Weed 
 Red leather skirt way up above her knees 
 Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown 
 She's a gone lost dirt road 
 There ain't no way back I been told 
 Well she's a story they all tell 
 She's a rebel, she's a yell 
 Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown 
 White heat in a cold rain 
 I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane 
 Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al 
 The second hand moon's shining for my gal 
 She's a big red flag in a mean bullpen 
 She'll steal it from you, sell it right 
 Back to you again 
 Well she's a wild rose, she's not settled 
 Cold gun of ice blue metal, oh 
 My baby's lowdown 
 White heat in a cold rain 
 I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane 
 Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al 
 She's a cheap motel with a burned out sign 
 She'll take care of you definitely every time 
 She got a stolen check book and leg's 
 Up to here. Singing into a hairbrush 
 Right in front of the mirror oh yeah, my baby's lowdownShe wore red shoes by the newstand 
 The rain splashed the nickel 
 And spilled like chablis all along the midway 
 There's a little bluejay 
 Red dress, sad night 
 One straw in a root beer 
 A compact with a cracked mirror 
 A bottle of 'Evening in Paris' perfume 
 What's this sad tune? 
 He told her to wait by the magazines 
 Take care of business it seems 
 Bring a raincoat 
 Bring a suitcase 
 Bring your dark eyes 
 And wear those red shoes 
 There's a dark huddle at the bus stop 
 Umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet 
 Li'l Caesar got caught 
 He was going on down to second 
 He was cooled 
 Changing stations on the chamber 
 To steal a diamond ring 
 From a jewelry store for his baby 
 He loved the way she looked 
 In those red shoes 
 She waited by the drugstore 
 Caesar had never been this late before 
 Dogs bayed the moon 
 And rattled their chains 
 And the cold jingle of taps in a puddle 
 Was the burglar alarm 
 Snitchin' on Caesar 
 Now the rain washes memories from the sidewalks 
 And the hounds splash down the nickel 
 Full of soldiers 
 Santa Claus is drunk in the ski room 
 It's Christmas Eve 
 In a sad cafe 
 When the moon gets this way 
 There's a little bluejay 
 By the newstand 
 Red shoes, red shoes 
 Meet me tonight by the drugstore 
 Meet me tonight by the drugstore 
 Meet me tonight by the drugstore 
 Goin' out tonight 
 Goin' out tonight 
 Goin' out tonight 
 Wear your red shoes 
 Red shoes, red shoes, red shoes, red shoesI love the way 
 The tattered clouds 
 Blow wind across the sky 
 As summer goes 
 And leave me 
 With a tear in my eye 
 I'm taking out my winter clothes 
 My garden knows what's wrong 
 The petals of my favourite rose 
 And shadows dark and long 
 Through every year it's very clear 
 I should be carrying on 
 But I can be found in the garden 
 Singing this song 
 When the last rose of summer is gone 
 The last rose of summer is goneI spent all my money in a Mexican whorehouse 
 Across the street from a Catholic church 
 And then I wiped off my revolver 
 And I buttoned up my burgundy shirt 
 I shot the morning in the back, with my red wings on 
 I told the sun he'd better go back down 
 And if I can find a book of matches 
 I'm goin' to burn this hotel down 
 You got to tell me, brave captain 
 Why are the wicked so strong? 
 How do the angels get to sleep 
 When the devil leaves the porch light on 
 Well, I dropped thirty grand on the Nugget slots 
 Had to sell my ass on Fremont Street 
 And the drummer said there's sanctuary 
 Over at the Baghdad Room 
 And now it's one for the money, two for the show 
 Three to get ready and go man go 
 I said, tell me Mr. Siegal 
 How do I get out of here? 
 Well, Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat 
 Drivin' dangerous curves across the dirty sheets 
 He said, "Man, you ought to see her when her parents are gone. 
 Man, you ought to hear her when the siren's on." 
 You got to tell me, brave captain 
 Why are the wicked so strong? 
 How do the angels get to sleep 
 When the devil leaves the porch light on? 
 Don't you know that ain't no broken bottle 
 That I picked up in my headlights 
 On the other side of the Nevada line 
 Where they live, hard die young 
 And have a good lookin' corpse every time 
 Well the pitboss said I should keep movin' 
 "This is where you go when you die." 
 And so I shot a black beauty 
 And I kissed her right between the eyes 
 Now Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat 
 Drivin' dangerous curves across the dirty sheets 
 He said, "When a bitch is wound up and her parents are gone 
 Man, you ought to hear her when the siren's on." 
 You got to tell me, brave captain 
 Why are the wicked so strong 
 How do the angels get to sleep 
 When the devil leaves the porch light on 
 I spent all my money, now, in a Mexican whorehouse 
 Across the street from a Catholic church 
 And then I wiped off my revolver 
 And buttoned up my burgundy shirt 
 I shot the morning in the back with my red wings on 
 Told the sun he'd better go back down 
 And if I can find a book of matches 
 I'm goin' to burn this hotel down 
 And now it's one for the money, two for the show 
 I said, three to get ready, go man go 
 I said, tell me Mr. Siegal 
 How do I get out of here?I'll shoot the moon 
 Right out of the sky 
 For you baby 
 I'll be the pennies 
 On your eyes 
 For you baby

 For youWell, they're lining up to mad dog your tilt-a-whirl 
 Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll 
 All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well 
 Take them back, take them back to your red house 
 For that fearful leap into the dark 
 Well, I did my time in the jail of your arms 
 Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn 
 Tell me, what did you do, what did you do the last time, why don't you do that? 
 Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way 
 Time's not your friend 
 Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away? 
 You're still leaving nothing but bones in the way 
 Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all? Excuse me while I sharpen my nails 
 And just are you, who are you this time? 
 You look rather tired, are you pretending to love? 
 Well, I hear that it pays well 
 How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go? 
 Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes? 
 Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth 
 And your wounded eyes 
 You'd better get down on the floor 
 Don't you know this is war 
 Tell me, who are you this time? 
 Tell me, who are you this time?Come on along with the Black Rider 
 We'll have a gay old time 
 Lay down in the web of the black spider

 Dutch Pink on a downtown train 
 Two-dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot 
 I'm in the corner on the pouring rain 
 Sixteen men on a dead man's chest 
 And I've been drinking from a broken cup 
 Two pairs of pants and a mohair vest 
 I'm full of bourbon, I can't stand up 
 Hey little bird, fly away home 
 Your house is on fire, children are alone

 Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head 
 And I'm stepping on the devil's tail 
 Across the stripes of a full moon's head 
 And through the bars of a Cuban jail 
 Bloody fingers on a purple knife 
 Flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass 
 I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife 
 Admire the view from up on top of the mast 
 Hey little bird, fly away home 
 House is on fire, children are alone 
 Hey little bird, fly away home

 Behind the wheel 
 With your arm around your sweet one 
 In your Oldsmobile 
 Barreling down the boulevard 
 You're looking for the heart of Saturday night 
 You got paid on Friday 
 Your pockets are jingling 
 Then you see the lights 
 You get all tingling 
 'Cause you're cruising with a six 
 And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night 
 Then you comb your hair 
 You shave your face 
 Trying to wipe out every trace 
 Of all the other days 
 In the week 
 You know that this will be the Saturday 
 You're reaching your peak 
 Stopping on the red 
 Going on the green 
 'Cause tonight'll be like nothing 
 You've ever seen 
 And you're barreling down the boulevard 
 And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night 
 Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls 
 Neon buzzing 
 Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin 
 Is it the barmaid that's smiling 
 In the corner of her eye 
 Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye 
 Makes it kind of quiver 
 Down in the core 
 'Cause your dreaming of them Saturdays 
 That came before 
 And now you're stumbling 
 You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night 
 And you gassed her up 
 And you're behind the wheel 
 With your arm around your sweet one 
 In your Oldsmobile 
 Barreling down the boulevard 
 You're looking for the heart of Saturday night 
 And is it the crack of the pool balls 
 Neon buzzing 
 Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin 
 And the barmaid that's smiling 
 In the corner of her eye 
 Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye 
 Makes it kind of special 
 Down in the core 
 And your dreaming of them Saturdays 
 That came before 
 It's found you stumbling 
 Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night 
 And you're stumbling 
 Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday nightDavenports and kettle drums 
 And swallow tail coats 
 Table cloths and patent leather shoes 
 Bathing suits and bowling balls 
 And clarinets and rings 
 And all this radio really 
 Needs is a fuse 
 A tinker, a tailor 
 A soldier's things 
 His rifle, his boots full of rocks 
 And this one is for bravery 
 And this one is for me 
 And everything's a dollar 
 In this box 
 Cuff links and hub caps 
 Trophies and paperbacks 
 It's good transportation 
 But the brakes aren't so hot 
 Neck tie and boxing gloves 
 This jackknife is rusted 
 You can pound that dent out 
 On the hood 
 A tinker, a tailor 
 A soldier's things 
 His rifle, his boots full of rocks 
 Oh and this one is for bravery 
 And this one is for me 
 And everything's a dollar 
 In this boxThey say you're seeing someone, you're wearing his ring 
 They say you laughed when you heard my name 
 They say he takes you dancing, he holds you so near 
 They say he'll buy you anything 
 Tell me am I foolish, I don't believe these stories 
 Louise, Louise, if it's true 
 Tell it to me 
 I know, you will not see me, but I know you have a daughter 
 And I hear she has my eyes 
 They say she calls him "father", and he's proud of her 
 And even believes all of your lies 
 But for all your faithless beauty, I'd give all my tomorrows 
 And if you're still thinking of me

 Bow and balance me

 Until she came to the old mill dam 
 And I'll be true to my love 
 If my love will be true to me 
 The miller, he got his fishinghook 
 Bow and balance me 
 The miller, he got his fishinghook 
 And fished that maiden out of the brook 
 And I'll be true to my love

 If my love will be true to meThe evening fell just like a star 
 Left a trail behind 
 You spit as you slammed out the door 
 If this is love we're crazy 
 As we fight like cats and dogs 
 But I just know there's got to be more 
 So please call me, baby wherever you are 
 It's too cold to be out walking in the streets 
 We do crazy things when we're wounded 
 Everyone's a bit insane 
 I don't want you catching your death of cold 
 Out walking in the rain 
 I admit that I ain't no angel 
 I admit that I ain't no saint 
 I'm selfish and I'm cruel, but you're blind 
 If I exorcise my devils well my angels may leave too 
 When they leave, they're so hard to find 
 So please call me, baby wherever you are 
 It's too cold to be out walking in the streets 
 We do crazy things when we're wounded 
 Everyone's a bit insane 
 I don't want you catching your death of cold 
 Out walking in the rain 
 And we're always at each other's throats 
 You know it drives me up the wall 
 But most of the time I'm just blowing off steam 
 And I wish God you'd leave me 
 Baby, I wish to God you'd stay 
 Life's so different than it is in your dreams 
 So please call me, baby wherever you are 
 It's too cold to be out walking in the streets 
 We do crazy things when we're wounded 
 Everyone's a bit insane 
 I don't want you catching your death of cold 
 Out walking in the rainC'mon let me get up on itI'll be clicking by your house about two forty-five 
 Sidewalk sundae, strawberry surprise

 Doncha know I'll be good, yeahSomeday the silver moon and I will go to Dreamland 
 I will close my eyes and wake up there in Dreamland 
 But tell me who will put flowers on a flower's grave? 
 Who will say a prayer? 
 Will I meet a China rose there in Dreamland 
 Or does love lie bleeding in Dreamland 
 Are these days gone forever and always 
 And if we are to die tonight 
 Is there moonlight up ahead? 
 And if we are to die tonight 
 Another rose will bloom 
 For a faded rose 
 Will I be the one that you save? 
 I love it when it showers 
 But no one puts flowers 
 On a flower's grave 
 As one rose blooms another will die 
 It's always been that way 
 I remember the showers 
 But no one puts flowers 
 On a flower's grave 
 If we are to die tonight 
 Is there moonlight up ahead? 
 I remember the showers 
 But no one puts flowers 
 On a flower's graveThey hung a sign up in our town 
 "If you live it up, you won't live it down" 
 So she left Monte Rio, son 
 Just like a bullet leaves a gun 
 With her charcoal eyes and Monroe hips 
 She went and took that California trip 
 Oh, the moon was gold, her hair like wind 
 Said, 'Don't look back, just come on, Jim' 
 Oh, you got to hold on, hold on 
 You gotta hold on 
 Take my hand, I'm standing right here 
 You gotta hold on 
 Well, he gave her a dimestore watch 
 And a ring made from a spoon 
 Everyone's looking for someone to blame 
 When you share my bed, you share my name 
 Well, go ahead and call the cops 
 You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops 
 She said, 'Baby, I still love you' 
 Sometimes there's nothin' left to do 
 Oh, but you got to hold on, hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 And take my hand, I'm standing right here 
 You gotta hold on 
 Well, God bless your crooked little heart 
 St. Louis got the best of me 
 I miss your broken China voice 
 How I wish you were still here with me 
 Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down 
 Then you burn your mansion to the ground 
 Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here 
 But when you're falling behind in this big blue world 
 Oh, you've got to hold on, hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 Take my hand, I'm standing right here 
 You gotta hold on 
 Down by the Riverside motel 
 It's 10 below and falling 
 By a 99 cent store 
 She closed her eyes and started swaying 
 But it's so hard to dance that way 
 When it's cold and there's no music 
 Oh, your old hometown's so far away 
 But inside your head there's a record that's playing 
 A song called 'Hold On', hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 Take my hand, I'm standing right there 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on, hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 Take my hand, I'm standing right there 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on, hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 And take my hand, I'm standing right here 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on, hold on 
 Babe, you gotta hold on 
 And take my hand, I'm standing right here 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold on, baby 
 You gotta hold on, girl 
 You gotta hold on 
 You gotta hold onWhat does it matter, a dream of love or a dream of lies 
 We're all gonna be in the same place when we die 
 Your spirit don't leave knowing your face or your name 
 The wind through your bones is all that remains 
 And we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 The quill from a buzzard, blood writes the word 
 I want to know, am I the sky or a bird? 
 Hell's boiling over and heaven is full 
 We're chained to the world and we all gotta pull 
 And we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 Now the killer was smiling with nerves made of stone 
 He climbed the stairs and the gallows groaned 
 And the peoples' hearts were pounding, they were throbbing, they were red 
 He swung out over the crowd, I heard the hangman said 
 We're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 Now Cain slew Abel, killed him with a stone 
 The sky cracked open and the thunder groaned 
 Along a river of flesh, can these dry bones live? 
 Take a king or a beggar and the answer they'll give 
 Is we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be, yeah 
 I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground 
 We're all gonna be just dirt in the groundBougainvillea's bloom and wind 
 Be careful mind the strangle vines 
 The rose is climbing over blind 
 'Cause the sun is on the other side 
 The bees will find their honey 
 The sweetest every time 
 Around a Red Rose 
 I see a red rose, a red rose 
 Blooming on another man's vine 
 Golden Willie's gone to war 
 He left his young wife on the shore 
 Will she be steadfast everyday? 
 While Golden Willie is far away 
 Along the way her letters end 
 She never reads what Willie sends 
 Now I see a red rose 
 I smell a red rose 
 I'll pick a red rose 
 Blooming on another man's vineHe's got himself a homemade special 
 You know his glass is full of sand 
 And it feels just like a jaybird 
 The way it fits into his hand 
 He rolled a blade up in his trick towel 
 They slap their hands against the wall 
 You never trip, you never stumble 
 He's walking Spanish down the hall 
 Slip him a picture of our Jesus 
 Or give him a spoon to dig a hole 
 What all he done ain't no one's business 
 But he'll need blankets for the cold 
 They dim the lights over on Broadway 
 Even the king has bowed his head 
 And every face looks right up at Mason 
 Man, he's walking Spanish down the hall 
 Litella's screeching for a blind pig 
 Punk Sanders carved it out of wood 
 He never sang when he got hoodwinked 
 They tried it all but he never would 
 Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry 
 But he'll be somewhere else to hear the call 
 Don't say goodbye, he's just leaving early 
 He's walking Spanish down the hall 
 All St. Bartholemew said was whispered 
 Into the ear of Blind Jack Dawes 
 All Baker told the machine 
 Was that he never broke the law 
 Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate 
 Take off your watch, your rings and all 
 Even Jesus wanted just a little more time 
 When he was walking Spanish down the hallI fell into the ocean 
 When you became my wife 
 I risked it all against the sea 
 To have a better life 
 Marie you are the wild blue sky 
 And men do foolish things 
 You turn kings into beggars 
 And beggars into kings 
 Pretend that you owe me nothing 
 And all the world is green 
 We can bring back the old days again 
 When all the world was green 
 The face forgives the mirror 
 The worm forgives the plow 
 The questions begs the answer 
 Can you forgive me somehow? 
 Maybe when our story's over 
 We'll go where it's always spring 
 The band is playing our song again 
 And all the world is green 
 Pretend that you owe me nothing 
 And all the world is green 
 We can bring back the old days again 
 When all the world was green 
 The moon is yellow silver 
 Oh the things that summer brings 
 It's a love you'd kill for 
 And all the world is green 
 He's balancing a diamond 
 On a blade of grass 
 The dew will settle on our graves 
 When all the world is green 
 Pretend that you owe me nothing 
 And all the world is green 
 We can bring back the old days again 
 When all the world was greenWhy plant a seed deep in the ground 
 Why, why, why 
 Why put a stone on a grave in town 
 Why, why, why 
 Tell me, tell me, tell me 
 Tell me why it's so 
 Tell me, tell me, tell me 
 Tell me so I'll know 
 Why does a wedding ring have the hardest stone 
 Why, why, why 
 Why does a little dog bury its bone 
 Why, why, why 
 So the river will not drown it 
 And the highway won't take it 
 And the dust will not cover it 
 And the sun will not blind it 
 And the wind won't blow it away

 Why write "I love you" on every page

 Tell me why it's so

 So the river will not drown it 
 So the highway won't take it 
 And the dust will not cover it 
 And the sun will not blind it

 What did you do before the war? 
 I was a chef, I was a chef 
 What was your name? 
 It was Geoff, Geoff 
 I lost my buddy and I wept, wept 
 I come down from the meth 
 So I slept, slept 
 I had a good home but I left, left 
 Pantsed at the wind for a joke 
 I pranced right in with the dope 
 Glanced at her shin she said, 
 "Nope."

 When I was over here I never got to vote 
 I left my arm in my coat 
 My mom, she died and never wrote 
 We sat by the fire and ate a goat 
 Just before he died he had a toke 
 Now I'm home and I'm blind 
 And I'm broke 
 What is next?Well he came home from the war 
 With a party in his head 
 And modified Brougham DeVille 
 And a pair of legs that opened up 
 Like butterfly wings 
 And a mad dog that wouldn't sit still 
 He went and took up with a Salvation Army Band girl 
 Who played dirty water 
 On a swordfishtrombone 
 He went to sleep at the bottom of 
 Tenkiller lake 
 And he said "gee, but it's 
 Great to be home." 
 Well he came home from the war 
 With a party in his head 
 And an idea for a fireworks display 
 And he knew that he'd be ready with 
 A stainless steel machete 
 And a half a pint of Ballentine's each day 
 And he holed up in room above a hardware store 
 Cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears 
 And he put a spell on some 
 Poor little Crutchfield girl 
 And stayed like that for 27 years 
 Well he packed up all his 
 Expectations he lit out for California 
 With a flyswatter banjo on his knee 
 With a lucky tiger in his angel hair 
 And benzedrine for getting there 
 They found him in a eucalyptus tree 
 Lieutenant got him a canary bird 
 And shaked her head with every word 
 And Chesterfielded moonbeams in a song 
 And he got 20 years for lovin' her 
 From some Oklahoma governor 
 Said everything this Doughboy does is wrong 
 Now some say he's doing 
 The obituary mambo 
 And some say he's hanging on the wall 
 Perhaps this yarn's the only thing 
 That holds this man together 
 Some say he was never here at all 
 Some say they saw him down in Birmingham, 
 Sleeping in a boxcar going by 
 And if you think that you can tell a bigger tale 
 I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie...Well, my time went so quickly 
 I went lickety-splitly 
 Out to my ol' 55 
 As I pulled away slowly 
 Feeling so holy 
 God knows I was feeling alive 
 Now, the sun's coming up 
 I'm riding with Lady Luck 
 Freeway, cars and trucks 
 Stars beginning to fade 
 And I lead the parade 
 Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer 
 Oh Lord, let me tell ya that the feeling getting stronger 
 And it's six in the morning 
 Gave me no warning 
 I had to be on my way 
 Well, there's trucks all a-passin' me 
 And the lights all are flashing 
 I'm on my way home from your place 
 And now the sun's coming up 
 And I'm riding with Lady Luck 
 Freeway, cars and trucks 
 Stars beginning to fade 
 And I lead the parade 
 Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer 
 Oh Lord, let me tell ya, the feeling getting stronger 
 And my time went so quickly 
 I went lickety-splitly 
 Out to my ol' 55 
 As I pulled away slowly 
 Feeling so holy 
 God knows I was feeling alive 
 And now the sun's coming up 
 Riding with Lady Luck 
 Freeway, cars and trucks 
 Freeway, cars and trucks 
 Freeway, cars and trucksLike a tin can feeding 
 Like a skinned hand bleeding 
 Like a tramp choir crying 
 Like a camp fire dying 
 Like a big dog breeding 
 Like a pig hog feeding 
 Like a top hat tipping 
 Like a dropped rat skipping 
 Like a tin horn glowing 
 Like a gin storm blowing 
 Like a neck tie flapping 
 Like a rich guy clapping 
 Like a big fool crawling 
 Like a rig tool falling 
 Like a back door squeaking 
 Like a crack whore tweaking 
 What is it like? 
 What is it like after we die? 
 Like a string that´s broken 
 Like a thing that´s smoking 
 Like a blue flame burning 
 Like a new brain learning 
 Like more cold coffee 
 Like a poor old softie 
 Like a declining graveyard 
 Like a shining brave star 
 Like a child that´s fainting 
 Like a wild ass painting 
 What is it like? 
 What is it like after we dieThe ocean doesn't want me today 
 But I'll be back tomorrow to play 
 The strangels will take me down deep in their brine 
 The mischievous brangles down into the endless blue wine 
 I'll open my head and let out all of my time 
 I'd love to go drowning and to stay and to stay 
 But the ocean doesn't want me today 
 I'll go in up to here, it can't possibly hurt 
 All they will find is my beer and my shirt 
 The riptide is raging and the lifeguard is away 
 But the ocean doesn't want me today 
 But the ocean doesn't want me today 
 The ocean doesn't want me todayI was in a line at the supermarket the other day, and uhm... y'know, I had all my things on the little conveyor belt there. 
 And uh... there's a gal in front of me that is uh... well, she's staring at me and I'm getting a little nervous and uh, she continues to stare at me. 
 And I uh, I keep looking the other way. 
 And then, finally she comes over closer to me and she says: "I apologise for staring, that must have been annoying. 
 I, 
 I... 
 You look so much like my son, who died. I just can't take my eyes off you." 
 And she precedes to go into her purse and she pulls out a photograph of her son who'd died. 
 And uh, he looks absolutely nothing like me. 
 In fact he's... 
 Chinese. 
 Uh... anyway, we chatted a little bit. 
 And uh, she says: "I'm sorry, I have to ask you. 
 Would you mind, as I leave the supermarket here, would you mind saying "Goodbye mom" to me? 
 I, I know it's a strange request but I haven't heard my son saying "Goodbye mom" to me, and "So long" and it would mean so much to me to hear it. 
 And uh, if you don't mind 
 I... " 
 And I said: "Well, you know, okay, yeah, sure. 
 Eh... uh... I can say that." 
 And, and so, she uh gets her groceries all checked out. 
 And uh, as she's going out the door she waves at me and she hollers across the store: "Goodbye son!" 
 And I look up and I wave and I say: "Goodbye mom!" 
 And then she goes, and uh... 
 So I get my few things there, on the conveyor belt and the checker checks out my things. 
 And uh, and he gives me the total and he says: "That'll be four hundred and seventy nine dollars." 
 Uh... and I said: "Well, how is that possible! I've only got a little tuna fish, and uh some skimmed milk, and uh mustard and a loaf of bread..." 
 He goes: "Well, well you're also paying for the groceries for your mother. 
 She uh, told me you'd take care of the bill for her." 
 And I said: "Well, wait a minute! 
 That's not my mother!" 
 And he says: "Well I distinctly heard her say as she left the store "Bye son!" and you said "Bye mom!" and so what are you trying to say here, uh..." I said: "Well, 
 Jesus!" 
 And I looked out into the parking lot and she was just getting into her car. 
 And I ran out there. 
 And she was just closing the door, and she had a little bit of her leg sticking out of the door and she was pulling away and I grabbed her leg and I started 
 PULLING it! 
 Just the way... I'm pulling yours...Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight 
 Nobody flinched down by the arcade 
 And the marquees weren't weeping, they went stark-raving mad 
 And the cabbies were the only ones that really had it made 
 And his cold trousers were twisted and the sirens high and shrill 
 And crumpled in his fist was a five-dollar bill 
 And the naked mannequins with their Cheshire grins 
 And the raconteurs and roustabouts said "Buddy, come on in, 'cause 
 'Cause the dreams ain't broken down here, nah, they're walking with a limp 
 Now that Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight" 
 And nobody flinched down by the arcade 
 And the burglar alarm's been disconnected 
 And the newsmen start to rattle 
 And the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in Seattle 
 And the fire hydrants plead the Fifth Amendment 
 And the furniture is bargains galore 
 But the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor 
 And what a hot rain on Forty-Second Street 
 And now the umbrellas ain't got a chance 
 And the newsboy's a lunatic with stains on his pants, 'cause 
 'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight 
 And no one's gone over to close his eyes 
 And there's a racing form in his pocket 
 Circled "Blue Boots" in the third 
 And the cashier at the clothing store didn't say a word 
 As the siren tears the night in half and someone lost his wallet 
 Well, a surveillance of assailance, if that's what you want to call it 
 And the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drugstore prophylactics 
 With their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos 
 And her radiator's steaming and her teeth are in a wreck, and nah 
 She won't let you kiss her, but what the hell do you expect? 
 And the gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume 
 Well, they'll bark you down like carnies, sell you Christmas cards in June 
 But Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight 
 And his headstone's a gumball machine 
 No more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams 
 Someone's hosing down the sidewalk and he's only in his teens, 'cause 
 'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight 
 And a fistful of dollars can't change that 
 And someone copped his watch fob and someone got his ring 
 And that newsboy got his pork pie Stetson hat 
 And the tuberculosis old men at the Nelson wheeze and cough 
 And someone will head south until this whole thing cools off 
 'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eight, yeah 
 Small Change got rained on with his own thirty-eightDepot, depot, what am I doing here? 
 Depot, depot, what am I doing here? 
 I ain't coming, I ain't going, my confusion is showing 
 Outside, the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue 
 I'm gonna paint myself blue at the depot 
 I watch the taxis pull up and idle 
 I can't claim title to a single memory 
 Offered me a key 'cause opportunity don't knock 
 Has no tongue and she cannot talk 
 You're gonna shuffle when you walk at the depot 
 This peeping-Tom needs a peephole and an uptempo song 
 Move me along when I find this depot, baby 
 I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby 
 I'm gonna be there at the roll call, maybe at the depot 
 Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue 
 Oh, tell me what a poor boy to do at the depot? 
 I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby 
 I'm gonna be there at the roll call, maybe at the depot 
 The depotEddie Grace's buick got four bullet holes in the side 
 Charley DeLisle is sittin' at the top of an avocado tree 
 Mrs Storm will stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn 
 I got a half a pack of lucky strikes man, so come along with me 
 Let's fill our pockets with macadamia nuts 
 And go over to Bobby Goodmanson's and jump off the roof 
 Hilda plays strip poker when her mama's across the street 
 Joey Navinsky says she put her tongue in his mouth 
 Dicky Faulkner's got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers 
 That eucalyptus is a hunchback, there's a wind down from the south 
 So let me tie you up with kite string, I'll show you the scabs on my knee 
 Watch out for the broken glass, put your shoes and socks on 
 Come along with me 
 Let's follow that fire truck, I think your house is burning down 
 Then go down to the hobo jungle and kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel 
 And we'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place 
 We'll steal a bunch of boysenberrys and I'll smear 'em on your face 
 I'll get a dollar from my mama's purse, buy that skull and crossbones ring 
 You can wear it round your neck on an old piece of string 
 Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold and flip him the bird 
 Slash the tires on the school bus, now don't say a word 
 I'll take a rusty nail, scratch your initials in my arm 
 I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof of the drugstore 
 I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair and a magpie's wings 
 And I'll tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet 
 I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad, cut the braces off your legs 
 And we'll bury them tonight out in the cornfield 
 Just put a church key in your pocket 
 We'll hop that freight train in the hall 
 We'll slide all the way down the drain 
 To New Orleans in the fallShe took all my money 
 And my best friend 
 You know the story 
 I have no pride 
 I have no shame 
 You gotta make it rain 
 Make it rain! 
 Since you're gone 
 Deep inside it hurts 
 I'm just another sad guest 
 On this dark earth 
 I want to believe 
 In the mercy of the world again 
 Make it rain, make it rain! 
 The night's too quiet 
 Stretched out alone 
 I need the whip of thunder 
 And the wind's dark moan 
 I'm not Able, I'm just Cain 
 Open up the heavens 
 Make it rain! 
 I'm close to heaven 
 Crushed at the gate 
 They sharpen their knives 
 On my mistakes 
 What she done, you can't give it a name 
 You gotta make it rain 
 Make it rain, yeah! 
 Without her love 
 Withour your kiss 
 Hell can't burn me 
 More than this 
 I'm burning up all this pain 
 Put out the fire 
 Make it rain! 
 I'm born to trouble 
 I'm born to fate 
 Inside a promise 
 I can't escape 
 It's the same old world 
 But nothing looks the same 
 Make it rain! 
 Make it rain! 
 Got to make it rain 
 Make it rain 
 You got to make it rain 
 Got to make it rain 
 You got to... 
 I stand alone here! 
 I stand alone here! 
 Sing it: 
 Make it rain! 
 Make it rain!Well, you can buy me a drink and I'll tell you what I seen 
 And I'll give you a bargain from the edge of a maniac's dream 
 That buys a black widow spider with a riddle in his yarn 
 That's clinging to the furrow of a blind man's brow 
 And I'll start talking from the brim of a thimble full of whiskey 
 On a train through the Bronx that will take you just as far 
 As the empty of a bottle to the highway of a scar 
 That stretched across the blacktop of my cheek like that 
 And then ducks beneath the brim of a fugitive's hat 
 You'll learn why liquor makes a stool pigeon rat on every face 
 That ever left his shadow down on Saint Mark's place 
 Hell, I'd double cross my mother if it was whiskey that they payed 
 And so an earlybird says nightsticks on the hit parade 
 And he ain't got a prayer and his days are numbered 
 And you'll track him down like a dog 
 Well, he's a tough customer you're getting in this trade 
 'Cause the nightstick's heart pumps lemonade 
 And whiskey keeps a blind man talking alright 
 And I'm the only one who knows just where he stayed last night 
 He was in a wrecking yard in a switchblade storm 
 In a wheelbarrow with nothing but revenge to keep him warm 
 And a half a million dollars in unmarked bills 
 Was the nightstick's blanket in a February chill 
 And as the buzzard drove a crooked sky 
 Beneath a black wing halo 
 He was dealin High Chicago in the mud 
 And stackin' the deck against a dragnet's eye 
 A shivering nightstick in a miserable heap 
 With a siren for a lullaby singing him to sleep 
 He was bleeding from a buttonhole 
 Torn by a slug fired from the barrel of a two dollar gun 
 That scorched a blister on the grip of a punk by now 
 Is learning what you have to pay to be a hero anyhow 
 He dressed the hole in his gut with a hundred dollar bandage 
 A king's ransom for a bedspread that don't amount to nothin' 
 Just cobweb strings on a busted ukulele 
 And the nightstick leaned on a black shillelagh 
 With the poison of a junkie's broken promise on his lip 
 He staggered in the shadows screaming "I ain't never been afraid." 
 And he shot out every street light on the promenade 
 Past the frozen ham and eggers at the penny arcade 
 Throwing out handfuls of a blood stained salary 
 They were dead in their tracks at the shooting gallery 
 And they fired off a twenty one gun salute 
 And from the corner of his eye he caught the alabaster orbs 
 Of a diamond dance hall girl and stuffed a thousand dollar bill 
 In her blouse and caught the cruel and unusual punishment of her smile 
 And the nightstick winked beneath a rainsoaked brim 
 Ain't no one seen hide nor hair of him, see 
 No one 'cept a spade out on Rikers Island and me 
 So if you're mad enough to listen to a full of whiskey blind man 
 Then you're mad enough to look beyond where bloodhounds dare to go 
 And if you want to know where the nightstick's hidin' out 
 You be down at the ferry landing, oh let's say bout half past a nightmare 
 When it's twisted on a clock, you tell 'em Nickels sentcha 
 Whiskey always makes him talk 
 And you ask for Captain Charon with the mud on his kicks 
 He's the skipper of the deadline steamer 
 And she sails from the Bronx across the river Styx 
 And a riddle's just a ticket for a dreamer 
 'Cause when the weathervane's sleepin' and the moon turns his back 
 You crawl on your belly along the railroad tracks 
 And cross your heart and hope to die and stick a needle in your eye 
 'Cause he'd cut my bleedin' heart out if he found out that I squealed 
 'Cause you see a scarecrow is just a hoodlum 
 Who marked the cards that he dealed 
 And pulled a gypsy switch 
 Out on the edge of Potter's FieldThe door was open, I was seething 
 Your mother burst in, it was freezing 
 She said it looks like it’s trying to rain 
 I was lost, I felt seasick 
 You convinced me that he'd left 
 You said, "Keep talking but don’t use any names." 
 I scolded your driver and your brother 
 We are old enough to know how long you've been hooked 
 And we've all been through the war 
 And each time you score 
 Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked 
 It felt like four in the morning 
 What sounded like fireworks 
 Turned out to be just what it was 
 The stars looked like diamonds 
 And then came the sirens 
 And everyone started to cuss 
 All the noise was disturbing 
 And I couldn’t find Irving 
 It was like two stations on at the same time 
 And then I hid your car keys 
 And I made black coffee 
 And I dumped out the rest of the rum 
 Nick and Socorro broke up 
 And Candice wouldn't shut up 
 And Fin, he recorded the whole thing 
 Ray he said, "Damn you." 
 And someone broke my camera 
 And it was New Year's 
 And we all started to sing: 
 "Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
 And never brought to mind 
 Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
 For the sake of auld lang syne" 
 I was leaving in the morning 
 With Charles for Las Vegas 
 And I didn't have a plan to come back 
 I had only a few things 
 Two hundred dollars 
 And my records in a brown paper sack 
 I ran out on Sheila 
 Everything’s in storage 
 Calvin's right 
 I should go back to driving truck 
 "Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
 And never brought to mind 
 Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
 For the sake of auld lang syne"I'm going straight to the top, whoa 
 I'm going where the air is fresh and clean 
 I'm going straight up to the top 
 If you know me, you know what I mean 
 I can't let Mister Sorrow try and pull ol' Frankie down 
 We live for tomorrow, I have found you 
 Straight to the top 
 I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean 
 I know I'm never gonna stop 
 Until I know, I know I'm wild and free 
 Hey, I'm going straight up to the top 
 And if you know me, you know what I mean 
 I can't let ol' Mister Sorrow try and pull me down 
 I live for tomorrow, I have found you 
 I'm going straight to the top, whoa 
 I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean 
 Yeah, whoa 
 I can't let Mister Sorrow pull ol' Frankie down 
 We live for tomorrow, I have found you 
 Straight to the top, oh yeah 
 Up where the air is 
 Up where the air is 
 Up where the air is

 Up where the air is fresh and clean, whoa 
 Whoa, how about that band? Whoa!She's my 
 Only true love 
 She's all that I think of 
 Look here 
 In my wallet that's her. 
 She grew up 
 On a farm there 
 There's a place on my arm 
 Where I've written her name 
 Next to mine. 
 You see I just can't 
 Live without her 
 And I'm her only boy 
 She grew up 
 Outside McHenry 
 In Johnsburg, Illinois.(Waits/Brennan/Linkous) 
 Well she's as mean as a needle 
 Don't get too close to the heater 
 She's like a mean shop keeper, who got an extra gun 
 She about 6'4" and she's a wreckin ball 
 Now go ahead and kiss her 
 She brought the bad weather with her 
 She got you coming through the dog door 
 She got you coming through the dog door. 
 Now pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered 
 You ought to walk away 
 Well you can't but you ought to, climb the rickety stairs 
 She got the long black hair, but don't sit there 
 Electricity chair 
 She got you coming through the dog door 
 She got you coming through the dog door. 
 Pitchfork 
 Crowbar 
 Clawhammer 
 Hot tar 
 She's got ruin in her name, but she can make it rain 
 She's a small town jail, and you're starving in the belly of a whale 
 She got you coming through the dog door 
 She got you coming through the dog door.

 Keeping me stoned 
 I won't run away 
 They say it's easy to get 
 Stuck in this town 
 Just like Joan 
 You know I gave it all up for the stage 
 They fill my cup up in the cage 
 It’s nobody's business but mine when I'm low 
 To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know 
 At the end of the world 
 And I kick my foot at the lights 
 I breathe it in all night 
 There's a light on a canvas tree 
 And money from home supporting me 
 They pay me not to come home 
 I won't eat crow 
 I'll stay away 
 And though all roads will 
 Not lead you home, my girl 
 All roads lead to the end of the world 
 And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown 
 The only way down from the gallows is to swing 
 And I'll wear boots instead of high heels 
 And the next stage that I am on 
 It will have wheelsMolly be damned smote Jimmy the Harp 
 With a horrid little pistol and a lariat 
 She's goin' to the bottom 
 And she's goin' down the drain 
 Said she wasn't big enough to carry it 
 She got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 She got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 She got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 She got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 Choppity chop goes the axe in the woods 
 You gotta meet me by the fall down tree 
 Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid 
 And I know they'll come lookin' for me boys 
 And I know they'll come a-lookin' for me 
 Got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 Got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 Got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 Got to get behind the Mule 
 In the morning and plow 
 Big Jack Earl was 8'1 
 He stood in the road and he cried 
 He couldn't make her love him 
 Couldn't make her stay 
 But tell the good Lord that he tried 
 Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville 
 On the wreck of the Weaverville stage 
 Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade 
 I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys 
 Stirring my brandy with a nail 
 Well the rampaging sons of the widow James 
 Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid 
 Had to stand naked at the bottom 
 Of the cross 
 And tell the good lord what they did 
 Tell the good lord what they did 
 Punctuated birds on the power line 
 In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Joaks 
 I'm diggin all the way to China 
 With a silver spoon 
 While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys 
 The hangman fumbles with the noose 
 Pin your ear to the wisdom post 
 Pin your eye to the line 
 Never let the weeds get higher 
 Than the garden 
 Always keep a sapphire in your mind 
 Always keep a diamond in your mind(Tom Waits/Chuck E. Weiss) 
 This is how the world will be 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 Forty monkeys drowning in a boiling sea 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 I went down into the valley to pray 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 I got drunk and I stayed all day 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 Everywhere I go, everywhere I go 
 Everywhere I go, it rains on me 
 All gods children can't you see 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 Louie Lista and Marchese 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 Robert Sheehan and Paul Body 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 I went down to Argyle 
 I went down to Dix 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 To get my special powders 
 And to get my fix 
 Everywhere I go it rains on me 
 Everywhere I go, everywhere I go 
 Everywhere I go, it rains on me 
 Everywhere I go, everywhere I go 
 Everywhere I go, it rains on meGrapefruit moon, one star shining 
 Shining down on me 
 Heard that tune, now I'm pining 
 Honey, can't you see? 
 'Cause every time I hear that melody 
 Well, something breaks inside 
 And the grapefruit moon, one star shining 
 Can't turn back the tide 
 Never had no destinations 
 Could not get acrossed 
 You became my inspiration 
 Oh, but what a cost 
 Every time I hear that melody 
 Well, something breaks inside 
 The grapefruit moon, one star shining 
 Is more than I can hide 
 Now I'm smoking cigarettes 
 And I strive for purity 
 And I slip just like the stars 
 Into obscurity 
 And every time I hear that melody 
 It puts me up a tree 
 And the grapefruit moon, one star shining 
 Is all that I can seeWell, we dig dig dig 
 Well, we dig in our mine the whole day through 
 Dig dig dig 
 That is what we like to do 
 And it ain't no trick to get rich quick 
 If you dig dig dig with a shovel and a pick 
 Dig dig dig, the whole day through 
 Got to dig dig dig, it's what we like to do 
 In our mine, in our mine 
 Where a million diamonds shine 
 We got to dig dig dig from the morning till the night 
 Dig dig dig up everything in sight 
 We got to dig dig dig, in our mine, in our mine 
 Dig up diamonds by the score 
 A thousand rubies, sometimes more 
 But we don't know what we are diggin' for, yeah 
 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho 
 It's off to work we go 
 We keep on singing all day long 
 Heigh-ho 
 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho 
 Got to make your troubles go 
 Well, you keep on singing all day long 
 Heigh-ho 
 Heigh-ho, heigh-hoLast night 
 I dreamed that I was dreaming of you 
 And from a window across the lawn I watched you undress 
 Wearing a sunset of purple tightly woven around your hair 
 That rose and strangled ebony curls 
 Moving in a yellow bedroom light 
 The air is wet with sound 
 The faraway yelping of a wounded dog 
 And the ground is drinking a slow faucet leak 
 Your house is so soft and fading as it soaks the black summer heat 
 A light goes on and a door opens 
 And a yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light and into the yard 
 A wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the air 
 I hear your champagne laugh 
 You wear two lavender orchids one in your hair and one on your hip 
 A string of yellow carnival lights comes on with the dusk 
 Circling the lake with a slowly dipping halo 
 And I hear a banjo tango 
 And you dance into the shadow of a black poplar tree 
 And I watched you as you disappeared 
 I watched you as you disappeared 
 I watched you as you disappeared 
 I watched you as you disappeared 
 I watched you as you disappearedI will leave behind all of my clothes 
 I wore when I was with you 
 All I need's my railroad boots 
 And my leather jacket 
 As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms 
 Although my heart is breaking 
 I will steal away out through your blinds 
 For soon you will be waking 
 The morning light has washed your face 
 And everything is turning blue now 
 Hold on to your pillow case 
 There's nothing I can do now 
 As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms 
 You'll find another soldier 
 And I swear to God by Christmas time 
 There'll be someone else to hold you 
 The only thing I'm taking is 
 The scarf off of your clothesline 
 I'll hurry past your chest of drawers 
 And your broken wind chimes 
 As I say goodbye 
 I'll say goodbye 
 Say goodbye to Ruby's arms 
 I will feel my way down the darkened hall 
 And out into the morning 
 The hobos at the freightyards 
 Have kept their fires burning 
 So Jesus Christ, this goddamn rain 
 Will someone put me on a train 
 I'll never kiss your lips again 
 Or break your heart 
 As I say goodbye 
 I'll say goodbye 
 Say goodbye to Ruby's armsWhen you walk through the garden 
 You gotta watch your back 
 Well I beg your pardon 
 Walk the straight and narrow track 
 If you walk with Jesus 
 He's gonna save your soul 
 You gotta keep the devil 
 Way down in the hole 
 He's got the fire and the fury 
 At his command 
 Well you don't have to worry 
 If you hold on to Jesus hand 
 We'll all be safe from Satan 
 When the thunder rolls 
 Just gotta help me keep the devil 
 Way down in the hole 
 All the angels sing about Jesus' mighty sword 
 And they'll shield you with their wings 
 And keep you close to the lord 
 Don't pay heed to temptation 
 For his hands are so cold 
 You gotta help me keep the devil 
 Way down in the holeWell, the time will come when the wind will shout 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 And all the sinners know what I'm talking about 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 When all the creatures of the world are gonna line up at the gate 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 And you better be on time and you better not be late 
 All stripped, all stripped, all stripped down, stripped down 
 Well, you know in your heart what you gotta bring 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 No big mink coat, no diamond ring 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 Well, take off your paint and take off your rouge 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 Let your backbone flip and let your spirit shine through 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 I want you all stripped, all stripped, all stripped down 
 All the men, well, they're going down the drain 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 And when I see your sadness on a river of shame 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 You got to raise up both the quick and the dead 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 With no shoes on your feet, no hat on your head 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 I want you all stripped, all stripped 
 All stripped, all stripped, all stripped 
 All stripped down 
 Ain't nothing in my heart but fire for you 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 With a rainy hammer and a heart that's true 
 All stripped down, all stripped down 
 I want you all stripped, all stripped, all stripped down 
 All stripped down 
 All stripped down 
 I want you all stripped, all strippedI'm leavin' my family, I'm leavin' all my friends 
 My body's at home but my heart's in the wind 
 Where the clouds are like headlines on a new front page sky 
 My tears are salt water and the moon's full and high 
 And I know Martin Eden's gonna be proud of me 
 Many before me who've been called by the sea 
 To be up in the crow's nest singin' my say 
 Shiver me timbers, 'cause I'm a-sailin' away 
 And the fog's liftin' and the sand's shiftin', I'm driftin' on out 
 And ol' Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothin' on me 
 So swallow me, don't follow me, I'm travelin' alone 
 Blue water's my daughter and I'm gonna skip like a stone 
 So please call my misses, you gotta tell her not to cry 
 My goodbye is written by the moon in the sky 
 And nobody knows me, I can't fathom my stayin' 
 And shiver me timbers, 'cause I'm a-sailin' away 
 And the fog's liftin', the sand's shiftin' and I'm driftin' on out 
 Ol' Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothin' on me 
 So come on swallow me, don't follow me, I'm travelin' alone 
 Blue water's my daughter, I'm gonna skip like a stone 
 I'm leavin' my family, I'm leavin' my friends 
 My body's at home but my heart's in the wind 
 Where the clouds are like headlines upon a new front page sky 
 And shiver me timbers, 'cause I'm a sailin' awayHe's an ol' altar boy 
 Lying out there in the street 
 He's an ol' alter boy 
 Bound up in leather and chains 
 That's why I'm feeling so blue 
 I'm an old altar boy 
 What about you? 
 Now, I can order in Latin 
 Make 'em au gratin, Joe 
 I'm an old altar boy 
 That's why I'm so depressed 
 I never got the rest of the dream 
 Just the ritual 
 Now I'm habitual 
 Majoring in crimes that are unspeakable 
 'Cause I'm an old altar boy 
 That's what happened to me. 
 I'm an old altar boy 
 He's hoping he can meet a woman dressed like a nun 
 He knows there's got to be some around here 
 Drinking across from the church 
 A little Father Cribari wine 
 On a Sunday morn' time. 
 I'm an old altar boy. 
 Why is he winking at this time in his life? 
 He never took a wife, 'cause he's an old altar boy 
 Oh, yeah... 
 What about you?Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe 
 Never slept with a dream before he had to go away 
 There's a bell in the tower 
 Uncle Ray bought a round 
 Don't worry about the army 
 In the cold cold ground 
 Now don't be a cry baby 
 When there's wood in the shed 
 There's a bird in the chimmney 
 And a stone in my bed 
 When the road's washed out 
 They pass the bottle around 
 And wait in the arms 
 Of the cold cold ground 
 Cold cold ground 
 There's a ribbon in the willow 
 And a tire swing rope 
 And a briar patch of berries 
 Takin' over the slope 
 The cat'll sleep in the mailbox 
 And we'll never go to town 
 Till we bury every dream in 
 The cold cold ground 
 Cold cold ground 
 Gimme a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells 
 Blow the roof off the goat barn 
 Let it roll down the hill 
 The piano is firewood 
 Times square is a dream 
 I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground 
 Cold cold ground 
 Cold cold ground 
 Call the cops on the Breedloves 
 Bring a bible and a rope 
 And a whole box of rebel 
 And a bar of soap 
 Make a pile of trunk tires 
 And burn 'em all down 
 Bring a dollar with you baby 
 In the cold cold ground 
 Cold cold ground 
 Take a weathervane rooster 
 Throw rocks at his head 
 Stop talking to the neighbors 
 Till we all go dead 
 Beware of my temper 
 And the dog that I've found 
 Break all the windows in the 
 Cold cold ground 
 Cold cold groundI put my chips on her shoulder 
 Running in the carnival time 
 She bought the things that I told her 
 They made her eyes sparkle and shine 
 Together we'll ring in the new year 
 I know that she'll be my queen 
 And if I fall asleep in your arms 
 Please wake me up in my dreams 
 Her out-fit was all made of vinyl 
 Like nothing I've ever seen 
 When our divorces are final 
 She'll fit right into my scheme 
 Next to the pawnshop's a chapel 
 I'll show you just what I mean 
 And if I fall asleep in your arms 
 Please wake me up in my dreams(Weill/Brecht) 
 You gentlemen who think you have a mission 
 To purge us of the seven deadly sins 
 Should first sort out the basic food position 
 Then start your preaching, that's where it begins 
 You lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well 
 Should learn, for once, the way the world is run 
 However much you twist or whatever lies that you tell 
 Food is the first thing, morals follow on 
 So first make sure that those who are now starving 
 Get proper helpings when we all start carving 
 What keeps mankind alive? 
 What keeps mankind alive? 
 The fact that millions are daily tortured 
 Stifled, punished, silenced and oppressed 
 Mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance 
 In keeping its humanity repressed 
 And for once you must try not to shriek the facts 
 Mankind is kept alive by bestial actsThe bats are in the belfry 
 The dew is on the moor 
 Where are the arms that held me 
 And pledged her love before 
 And pledged her love before 
 It's such a sad old feeling 
 The hills are soft and green 
 It's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 I made a golden promise 
 That we would never part 
 I gave my love a locket 
 And then I broke her heart 
 And then I broke her heart 
 It's such a sad old feeling 
 The fields are soft and green 
 It's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 Innocent when you dream 
 Running through the graveyard 
 We laughed, my friends and I 
 We swore we'd be together 
 Until the day we died 
 Until the day we died 
 It's such a sad old feeling 
 The fields are soft and green 
 It's memories that I'm stealing 
 But you're innocent when you dream 
 When you dream 
 You're innocent when you dream 
 When you dreamOperator, number, please, it's been so many years 
 Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears? 
 Hello, hello there, is this Martha? This is old Tom Frost 
 And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost 
 'Cause it's been forty years or more, now, Martha, please recall 
 Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all 
 And those were days of roses, poetry and prose 
 And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me 
 There was no tomorrows and we'd packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved 'em for a rainy day 
 And I feel so much older now, you're much older, too 
 How's the husband? How's your kids? You know that I got married, too? 
 Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure 
 'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature 
 And those were days of roses, poetry and prose 
 And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me 
 There was no tomorrow, we'd packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved 'em for a rainy day 
 And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am 
 And all that really mattered then was that I was a man 
 I guess that our being together was never meant to be 
 And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see? 
 And those were days of roses, poetry and prose 
 And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me 
 There was no tomorrows, and we'd packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved them for a rainy day 
 And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to youWhen you hear sweet syncopation 
 And the music softly moans 
 T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
 And dance around in your bones 
 When it gets too hot for comfort 
 And you can't get an ice cream cone 
 T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
 And dance around your bones 
 Just like those bamboo babies 
 Down in the South Sea tropic zone 
 T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
 And dance around your bonesMuriel 
 Since you left town the clubs closed down 
 And there's one more burned out lamppost on Main Street 
 Down where we used to stroll 
 And Muriel 
 I still hit all the same old haunts 
 And you follow me wherever I go 
 And Muriel 
 I see you on a Saturday night 
 In a penny arcade with your hair tied back 
 And the diamond twinkle that's in your eye 
 Is the only wedding ring that I'll buy you 
 Muriel 
 And Muriel 
 How many times I've left this town 
 To hide from your memory 
 And it haunts me 
 But I only get as far as the next whiskey bar 
 I buy another cheap cigar and I'll see you every night 
 Hey Muriel 
 Muriel 
 Hey buddy, got a light?Well, she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula 
 Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors 
 She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes 
 Well, it's just an invitation to the blues 
 And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth 
 At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore 
 You wonder if she might be single, she's alone and likes to mingle 
 Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue 
 She said "How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?" 
 You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble 
 On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting outta here 
 It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes 
 This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues 
 But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java 
 It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers 
 Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey 
 But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind 
 And a dream that I was chasing and a battle with booze 
 And an open invitation to the blues 
 But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy 
 And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things 
 He probably left her for a socialite and he didn't love her 'cept at night 
 And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared 
 So they took the registration and the car keys and her shoes 
 And left her with an invitation to the blues 
 'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening 
 You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while 
 Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring 
 And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose? 
 Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose 
 And I'll accept your invitation to the bluesWell I stumbled in the darkness 
 I'm lost and alone 
 Though I said I'd go before us 
 And show the way back home 
 There a light up ahead 
 I can't hold on very long 
 Forgive me pretty baby 
 I always take the 
 Long way home 
 Money's just something you throw 
 Off the back of a train 
 I got a head full of lightning 
 And hat full of rain 
 And I know that I said 
 I'd never do it again 
 And I love you pretty baby 
 But I'll always take 
 The long way home 
 I put food on the table 
 And roof over our head 
 But I'd trade it all tomorrow 
 For the highway instead 
 Watch your back 
 Keep your eyes shut tight 
 Your love's the only thing I've ever known 
 But one thing's for sure pretty baby 
 I'll always take the long way home 
 I love you baby 
 More than the whole wide world 
 You are my woman you know 
 You are my pearl 
 Let's go out 
 Past the party lights 
 Where can we finally be alone 
 Come with me and together we 
 We can take the long way homeWell, I wish I was in New Orleans 
 I can see it in my dreams 
 Arm in arm down Burgundy 
 A bottle and my friends and me 
 Hoist up a few tall cool ones 
 Play some pool and listen 
 To that tenor saxophone calling me home 
 And I can hear the band begin 
 "When The Saints Go Marching In" 
 By the whiskers on my chin 
 New Orleans I'll be there 
 I'll drink you under the table 
 Be red nose go for walks 
 The old haunts what I wants 
 Is red beans and rice 
 And wear the dress I like so well 
 Meet me at the old saloon 
 Make sure there's a Dixie moon 
 New Orleans I'll be there 
 And deal the cards roll the dice 
 If it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss 
 And Claiborne Avenue me and you 
 Sam Jones and all 
 And I wish I was in New Orleans 
 'Cause I can see it in my dreams 
 Arm in arm down Burgundy 
 A bottle and my friends and me 
 New Orleans I'll be thereRed pants and the Sugarman in the temple street gloom

 Sugarman says, "Baby, everything's alright." 
 Goin' downtown, down downtown 
 Goin' downtown 
 Montclaire de Havelin doin' the Saint Vitus dance

 All night long 
 All night long 
 All night long 
 All night longHush a wild violet, hush a band of gold 
 Hush, you're in a story I heard somebody told 
 Tear the promise from my heart, tear my heart today 
 You have found another, oh baby, I must go away 
 So hang down your head for sorrow 
 Hang down your head for me 
 Hang down your head tomorrow 
 Hang down your head, Marie 
 Hush my love, the rain now 
 Hush, my love was so true 
 Hush my love, a train now 
 Well, it takes me away from you

 Hang down your head, Marie 
 So hang down your head for sorrow 
 Hang down your head for me 
 Hang down your head, hang down your head 
 Hang down your head, MarieWell, these diamonds on my windshield 
 Are tears from heaven 
 Well, I'm pullin' into town on the interstate 
 I got a steel train in the rain 
 And the wind bites my cheek through the wing 
 And it's these late nights 
 And this freeway drive always makes me sing 
 There's a duster tryin' to change my tune 
 He's pullin' up fast on the right 
 Rollin' restlessly by a 24 hour moon 
 And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head 
 He's wishin' he's home in a Wisconsin bed 
 But there's fifteen feet of snow in the east 
 Colder then a well digger's ass 
 And it's colder then a well digger's ass 
 Oceanside, it ends the ride 
 With San Clemente comin' up 
 Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back 
 And the Orange drive-in, the neon billin' 
 And the theater's fillin' to the brim 
 With slave girls and hot spurn, bucket full of sin 
 Metropolitan area 
 Interchange and connections 
 Fly-by-nights from Riverside 
 And out of state plates, runnin' a little late 
 But the sailors jockey for the fast lane 
 101, don't miss it 
 There's rollin' hills and concrete fields 
 And a broken line on your mind 
 The eights go east and the fives go north 
 And the merging nexus back and forth 
 You see your sign, cross the line 
 Signaling with a blink 
 And the radio's gone off the air 
 And it gives you time to think 
 And you hear the rumble as you fumble for a cigarette 
 And blazin' through this neon jungle 
 You remember someone that you met 
 And one more block, the engine talks 
 It whispers, "Home at last." 
 Whispers, "Home at last." 
 Whispers, "Home at last." 
 Whispers, "Home at last." 
 Whispers, "Home at last." 
 And the diamonds on my windshield 
 And these tears from heaven 
 Well, I'm pullin' into town on the interstate 
 I got me a steel train in the rain 
 And the wind bites my cheek through the wing 
 Late nights, freeway flying always makes me sing 
 Always makes me singWell my baby's so fine 
 Even her car looks good from behind 
 Oh yeah! 
 Well my baby's so fine 
 Even her car looks good from behind 
 But the train that took my baby 
 It went clang, boom and steam
