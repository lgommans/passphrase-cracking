I can't sleep 'cause it's burnin' deep inside 
 Like gasoline on fire, runnin' wild 
 No more fear 'cause I'm gettin' closer now 
 So unreal but I like it anyhow 
 I go faster and faster and faster and faster 
 And faster and faster and faster 
 And I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I can't hide from the feelin' 'cause it's right 
 And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life 
 I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 I can feel that you mesmerize my heart 
 I feel so free, I'm alive, I'm breakin' out 
 I won't give in 'cause I'm proud of all my scars 
 And I can see I've been wastin' too much time 
 I go faster and faster and faster and faster 
 And faster and faster and faster 
 And I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I can't hide from the feelin' 'cause it's right 
 And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life 
 I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I can't hide from the feelin' 'cause it's right 
 And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life 
 I can't live in a fairytale of lies 
 A fairytale of liesWe're gonna have a gothic christmas; that is what we'll do 
 We're gonna have a gothic christmas; hope you'll have one too 
 Santa's going to wear a black vest just for me and you. 
 Santa's going to grunt in latin and slay a dragon or two. 
 Rudolph, he will change his name 
 'Cause rudolph just sounds pretty lame. 
 Now we'll call him Ragnagord, the evil reindeer overlord. 
 His nose it shall be red no more. 
 It will be blackened to the core. 
 His eyes will glow an evil glow to guide the chariot through the snow. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We're gonna have a gothic christmas; that is what we'll do. 
 We're gonna have a gothic christmas; hope you have one too. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
 Hope you'll have a gothic christmas too.My hope is on fire 
 My dreams are for sale 
 I dance on a wire 
 I don't want to fail her 
 I walk against the stream 
 Fight for what I believe in 
 I run towards the end 
 Trying not to give in 
 She's lost in the darkness, fading away 
 I'm still around here screaming her name 
 She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive 
 My heart is frozen, I'm losing my mind 
 Help me, I'm buried alive! 
 Buried alive! 
 I'm burning the bridges 
 And there's no return 
 I'm trying to reach her 
 I feel that she yearns 
 I walk against the stream 
 Fight for what I believe in 
 I run towards the end 
 Trying not to give in 
 She's lost in the darkness, fading away 
 I'm still around here, screaming her name 
 She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive 
 My heart is frozen, I'm losing my mind 
 Help me, I'm buried alive! 
 Buried alive! 
 I tried to revive what's already drowned 
 They think I'm a fool who can't realize 
 Hope plays a wicked game with the mind 
 'Cause I thought that love would bind 
 I cannot revive what's already drowned 
 She won't come around 
 She's lost in the darkness, fading away 
 I'm still around here screaming her name 
 She's haunting my dreamworld trying to survive 
 My heart is frozen, I'm losing my mind 
 Help me, I'm buried alive! 
 Buried alive!I've been walking this road of desire 
 I've been begging for blood on the wall 
 I don't care if I'm playing with fire 
 I'm aware that I'm frozen inside 
 I have known all along 
 So much more going on, no denying 
 But I know I'm not standing alone 
 You've been playing my mind through my wishes 
 You can feel that we're haunting the truth 
 Don't know why, can't hold on, always losing control 
 In the middle of the night 
 I don't understand 
 What's going on, it's a world gone astray 
 In the middle of the night 
 I can't let it end 
 So I'll keep searching in shadows 
 Your life, it will never be in vain 
 In the middle of the night 
 No more tears, no, 'cause nothing else matters 
 I've been closing my eyes for too long 
 Only vengeance will make me feel better 
 There's no rest till I know that it's done 
 You've been playing my mind through my wishes 
 You can feel that we're haunting the truth 
 Don't know I can't hold on always losing control 
 In the middle of the night 
 I don't understand 
 What's going on, it's a world gone astray 
 In the middle of the night 
 I can't let it end 
 So I'll keep searching in shadows 
 Your life, it will never be in vain 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 I don't understand 
 What's going on, it's a world gone astray 
 In the middle of the night 
 I can't let it end 
 So I'll keep searching in shadows 
 Your life, it will never be in vain 
 In the middle of the nightEvery finger in the room is pointing at me 
 I wanna spit in their faces, then I get afraid what that could bring 
 I got a bowling ball in my stomach, I got a desert in my mouth 
 Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now 
 I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets 
 I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in 
 Just what God needs, one more victim 
 Why do we crucify ourselves? Well, every day 
 I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you 
 I crucify myself every day 
 I crucify myself 
 And my heart is sick of being 
 I said my heart is sick of being 
 In chains, oh, chains, oh 
 Got a kick for a dog, beggin' for love 
 I gotta have my suffering, so that I can have my cross 
 I know a cat named Easter, but he says, "Will you ever learn? 
 You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird." 
 I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets 
 I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in 
 Got enough guilt to start my own religion 
 Why do we crucify ourselves? Every day 
 I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you 
 I crucify myself every day 
 I crucify myself 
 My heart is sick of being 
 I said my heart is sick of being 
 In chains, oh, chains, oh 
 Please, please, please, save me 
 I cry, ah, ah 
 Looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets 
 I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in 
 Where are those angels when you need them? 
 Why do we crucify ourselves? Every day 
 I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you 
 I crucify myself every day 
 I crucify myself 
 My heart is sick of being 
 I said my heart is sick of being 
 In chains, oh, chains, oh 
 Why do we, oh, chains 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 Crucify ourselves everyday? 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 Oh, chains, oh, why? Yeah 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 Yeah, chains, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 Never going back again, oh 
 To crucify myself again, you know 
 (Why do we crucify ourselves?) 
 Never going back again 
 To crucify myself everydaySparkling angel, I believed 
 You were my savior in my time of need 
 Blinded by faith, I couldn't hear 
 All the whispers, the warnings so clear 
 I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door 
 There's no escape now, no mercy, no more 
 No remorse 'cause I still remember 
 The smile when you tore me apart 
 You took my heart 
 Deceived me right from the start 
 You showed me dreams 
 I wished they'd turn into real 
 You broke a promise and made me realize: 
 It was all just a lie 
 Sparkling angel, I couldn't see 
 Your dark intentions, your feelings for me 
 Fallen angel, tell me why, 
 What is the reason, the thorn in your eye? 
 I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door 
 There's no escape now, no mercy, no more 
 No remorse, 'cause I still remember 
 The smile when you tore me apart 
 You took my heart 
 Deceived me right from the start 
 You showed me dreams 
 I wished they'd turn into real 
 You broke the promise and made me realize: 
 It was all just a lie 
 Could have been forever 
 Now we have reached the end! 
 This world may have failed you; 
 It doesn't give you a reason whyâ€” 
 You could have chosen a different path in life 
 The smile when you tore me apart 
 You took my heart 
 Deceived me right from the start 
 You showed me dreams 
 I wished they turn into real 
 You broke the promise and made me realize 
 It was all just a lie 
 Could have been forever 
 Now we have reached the endI'll protect you from the hooded claw 
 Keep the vampires from your door 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Feels like fire 
 I'm so in love with you 
 Dreams are like angels 
 They keep bad at bay, bad at bay 
 Love is the light 
 Scaring darkness away, yeah 
 I'm so in love with you

 The power of love 
 A force from above 
 Cleaning my soul 
 Flame on burnt desire 
 Love with tongues of fire

 I'll protect you from the hooded claw 
 Keep the vampires from your door 
 When the chips are down, I'll be around 
 With my undying, death-defying 
 Love for you 
 Envy will hurt itself 
 Let yourself be beautiful 
 Sparkling love, flowers 
 And pearls and pretty girls 
 Love is like an energy 
 Rushin', rushin' inside of me 
 The power of love 
 A force from above 
 Cleaning my soul 
 Flame on burnt desire 
 Love with tongues of fire

 Make love your goal 
 This time, we go sublime 
 Lovers entwine, divine, divine 
 Love is danger, love is pleasure 
 Love is pure, the only treasure 
 I'm so in love with you

 The power of love 
 A force from above 
 Cleaning my soul

 Make love your goal 
 I'll protect you from the hooded claw 
 Keep the vampires from your doorI'm searching for answer 
 Cause something is not right 
 I follow the signs 
 I'm close to the fire 
 I fear that soon you'll reveal 
 Your dangerous mind 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 I fear your smile and the promise inside 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside 
 I'm searching for answers 
 Not questioned before 
 The curse of awareness 
 There's no peace of mind 
 As your true colours show 
 A dangerous sign 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 I see the truth that you've buried inside 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 There's no mercy, just anger I find 
 I just have to know, while I still have time 
 Do I have to run, or hide away from you? 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 I see the truth that you've buried inside 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 There's no mercy, just anger I find 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 I see the truth that you've buried inside 
 It's in your eyes, what's on your mind 
 There's no mercy, just anger I findThe shadows of the night, 
 Are unleashed again. 
 Where their greed begins 
 The end is near. 
 A morbid hunger for blood, 
 Lies in their cold black eyes 
 They've come to take our lives away. 
 One by one they died. 
 A massacre that took all night 
 They had no chance, it was no fight 
 You can't kill what has been killed before, 
 They died... 
 With shadows on its tale. 
 He stepped through the portal, 
 Locked the door and ate the key. 
 With his life they took their way to freedom, 
 And be became the final keeper of the key.Is it true what they say, 
 Are we too blind to find the way? 
 Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today. 
 Come into my world, 
 See through my eyes. 
 Try to understand, 
 Don't want to lose what we have. 
 We've been dreaming, 
 But who can deny, 
 It's the best way of living 
 Between the truth and the lies. 
 See who I am, 
 Break through the surface. 
 Reach for my hand, 
 Let's show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way. 
 The world is in our hands. 
 This is not the end. 
 Fear is withering the soul 
 At the point of no return. 
 We must be the change 
 We wish to see. 
 I'll come into your world, 
 See through your eyes. 
 I'll try to understand, 
 Before we lose what we have. 
 We just can't stop believing, 
 'Cause we have to try. 
 We can rise above, 
 Their truth and their lies. 
 See who I am, 
 Break through the surface. 
 Reach for my hand, 
 Let's show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way. 
 The world is in our hands. 
 See who I am, 
 Break through the surface. 
 Reach for my hand, 
 Let's show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way. 
 The world is in our hands. 
 This is not the end. 
 I hear the silence 
 Preaching my blame. 
 Will our strength remain, 
 If their power reigns? 
 See who I am, 
 Break through the surface. 
 Reach for my hand, 
 Let's show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way. 
 The world is in our hands. 
 See who I am, 
 (See who I am.) 
 Break through the surface. 
 Reach for my hand, 
 Let's show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way. 
 The world is in our hands. 
 This is not the end.This is the end 
 Hold your breath and count to ten 
 Feel the earth move and then 
 Hear my heart burst again 
 For this is the end 
 I've drowned and dreamt this moment 
 So overdue, I owe them 
 Swept away, I'm stolen 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 At Skyfall 
 At Skyfall 
 Skyfall is where we start 
 A thousand miles and poles apart 
 Where worlds collide and days are dark 
 You may have my number 
 You can take my name 
 But you'll never have my heart 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 At Skyfall 
 (Let the sky fall) 
 (When it crumbles) 
 (We will stand tall) 
 (Let the sky fall) 
 (When it crumbles) 
 (We will stand tall) 
 Where you go, I go 
 What you see, I see 
 I know I'd never be me 
 Without the security 
 Of your loving arms 
 Keeping me from harm 
 Put your hand in my hand 
 And we'll stand 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 At Skyfall 
 Let the sky fall 
 We will stand tall 
 At SkyfallYou'll burn this time 
 Seeing the violence 
 It's speeding my mind 
 No one is saving you 
 How can you find 
 A heaven in this hell? 
 Leave it behind 
 Hearing your silence 
 It screams our goodbye 
 Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye 
 Let us go to waste 
 Angels have faith 
 I don't want to be a part of his sin 
 I don't want to get lost in his world 
 I'm not playing this game 
 When the shadows remain in the light of day 
 On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate 
 He'll be fallen from grace 
 Until the end of all his days 
 From the ashes and hate 
 It's a cruel demon's fate 
 On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay 
 There will be no escape 
 'Cause he's fallen far from grace 
 What have you done? 
 Is this what you wanted? 
 What have you become? 
 Your soul's now forsaken 
 You're walking alone 
 From heaven into hell 
 Now that you know 
 Your way in this madness 
 Your powers have grown 
 Your chains have been broken 
 You suffered so long 
 You will never change. 
 Angels have faith 
 I don't want to be a part of his sin 
 I don't want to get lost in his world

 On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate 
 He'll be falling from grace 
 Till the end of all his days 
 From the ashes and hate 
 It's a cruel demon's fate 
 On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay 
 There will be no escape 
 'Cause he's fallen far from grace

 So I will know you're back 
 You're here again for a while 
 Oh, let us share 
 The memories that only we can share 
 Together 
 Tell me about 
 The days before I was born, 
 How we were as children 
 You touch my hand 
 These colors come alive 
 In your heart and in your mind 
 I cross the borders of time 
 Leaving today behind to be with you again 
 We breath the air 
 Do you remember how you used to touch my hair? 
 You're not aware 
 Your hands keep still 
 You just don't know that I am here 
 It hurts too much 
 I pray now that soon you'll release 
 To where you belong 
 You touch my hand 
 These colors come alive 
 In your heart and in your mind 
 I cross the borders of time 
 Leaving today behind to be with you again 
 Please, say my name 
 Remember who I am 
 You will find me in the world of yesterday 
 You drift away again 
 To far from where I am 
 When you ask me who I am 
 Say my name 
 These colors come alive 
 In your heart and in your mind 
 I cross the borders of time 
 Leaving today behind to be with you again 
 Say my nameEasy come, easy go, that's just how you live 
 Oh, take, take, take it all, but you never give 
 Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss 
 Had your eyes wide open, why were they open? 
 Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
 You tossed it in the trash, you did 
 To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
 'Cause what you don't understand is 
 I'd catch a grenade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 You know I'd do anything for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Oh, I would go through all this pain 
 Take a bullet straight through my brain 
 Yes, I would die for you, baby 
 But you won't do the same 
 No, no, no, no 
 Black, black, black and blue, beat me till I'm numb 
 Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from 
 Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are 
 Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
 Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
 You tossed it in the trash, yes you did 
 To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
 'Cause what you don't understand is 
 I'd catch a grenade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 You know I'd do anything for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Oh, I would go through all this pain 
 Take a bullet straight through my brain 
 Yes, I would die for ya, baby 
 But you won't do the same 
 If my body was on fire 
 Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames 
 You said you loved me, you're a liar 
 'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby 
 But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 You know I'd do anything for ya 
 (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Oh, I would go through all this pain 
 Take a bullet straight through my brain 
 Yes, I would die for you, baby 
 But you won't do the same 
 No, you won't do the same 
 You wouldn't do the same 
 Ooh, you never do the same 
 No, no, no, noOn behalf of her love 
 She no longer sleeps 
 Life had no longer meaning 
 Nothing to make her stay 
 She sold her soul away 
 I held you tight to me 
 You slipped away 
 You promised to return to me 
 And I believed 
 I believed 
 After the night he died 
 I wept my tears until they dried 
 But the pain stayed the same 
 I didn't want him to die all in vain 
 I made a promise to revenge his soul in time 
 I'll make them bleed down at my feet 
 I held you tight to me 
 You slipped away 
 You promised to return to me 
 And I believed 
 I believed 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Could I have known about their true intentions? 
 As the pain stayed the same 
 I'm going to haunt them down all the way 
 I made a promise to revenge his soul in time 
 One by one they were surprised 
 I held you tight to me 
 You slipped away 
 You promised to return to me 
 And I believed 
 I believedI can't feel my senses 
 I just feel the cold 
 All colors seem to fade away 
 I can't reach my soul 
 I would stop running, if I knew there was a chance 
 It tears me apart to sacrifice it all, but I'm forced to let go 
 Tell me I'm frozen, but what can I do? 
 Can't tell the reasons I did it for you 
 When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you 
 You say that I'm frozen, but what can I do? 
 I can feel your sorrow 
 You won't forgive me, 
 But I know you'll be all right 
 It tears me apart that you will never know, but I have to let go 
 Tell me I'm frozen, but what can I do? 
 Can't tell the reasons I did it for you 
 When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you 
 You say that I'm frozen, but what can I do? 
 Everything will slip away 
 Shattered pieces will remain 
 When memories fade into emptiness 
 Only time will tell its tale 
 If it all has been in vain 
 I can't feel my senses 
 I just feel the cold 
 Frozen... 
 But what can I do? 
 Frozen... 
 Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do? 
 Can't tell the reasons I did it for you 
 When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you 
 You say that I'm frozen, frozen...I'm working hard from dusk till dawn 
 Warm my body to the bone 
 This hard feeling won't leave me alone 
 Feels so cold, oh bring me home 
 It's one of these days 
 Just one of these days 
 That blows us away 
 I walk this Earth 
 I walk this Earth 
 For what it's worth 
 I walk this Earth 
 Fight like a lion to shake it off 
 Hunger I need to settle a score 
 With a ghost can't fight no more 
 In your footsteps I walk this Earth 
 It's one of these days 
 Just one of these days 
 That blows us awayOn golden wings 
 She flies at night 
 With her dress 
 It's blinding white 
 Countless diamonds 
 And her long blond hair 
 The queen is coming 
 So you'd better be aware 
 Her plants and flowers 
 They are never the same 
 Blue and silver 
 It's all her game 
 Flying dragons 
 And enchanted woods 
 She decides, she creates 
 It's her reality 
 In her world 
 Of dreams and make believe 
 She reigns forever 
 With all her glory 
 Unicorns appear in her sight 
 Her fireflies 
 Lead her trough these woods 
 At night 
 In search of the legendary amulet 
 And it's secrets 
 In the big oak 
 There is a door 
 Wich will lead her 
 To the wizard's shore 
 And she'll ask him 
 For the wind to sail her home 
 To the world where she belongs 
 In her world 
 Of dreams and make believe 
 She reigns forever 
 With all her glory 
 In this world 
 Of endless fantasy 
 She makes it happen 
 It's her reality 
 In her world 
 Of dreams and make believe 
 She reigns forever 
 With all her glory 
 In this world 
 Of endless fantasy 
 She makes it happen 
 It's her realityI hear your whispers 
 Break the silence and it calms me down. 
 Your taste on my lips, 
 Your salty kisses. 
 They say I'm seeking out the danger. 
 That one day you won't let me go, 
 I'll drown, you'll take me down. 
 I need you Aquarius, 
 Enchanted I will have to stay. 
 I feel you Aquarius, 
 Cause you, the sea, set me free. 
 You call to me Aquarius. 
 You call to me, you set me free. 
 I relinquish to your powers. 
 From your grasp, I just can't hide. 
 I missed the danger I had to conquer. 
 You made me feel alive. 
 They say I have to be aware, 
 That one day you won't let me go, 
 I'll drown, you'll take me down. 
 I need you Aquarius, 
 Enchanted I will have to stay. 
 I feel you Aquarius, 
 Cause you, the sea, set me free. 
 You call to me Aquarius. 
 I long for you Aquarius, 
 I need to be with you again. 
 I fear you, Aquarius, 
 My destiny until the end. 
 I need you Aquarius, 
 Enchanted I will have to stay. 
 I feel you Aquarius, 
 Cause you, the sea, set me free. 
 You call to me Aquarius.Is there a place deep within 
 A place where you hide you're darkest sins 
 There's a strange kind of ambiance, 
 Its surrounding you. 
 As a songstress you lure me, 
 Towards the truth. 
 Candles die down as you leave the room 
 In my heart you leave no gloom 
 As you lure me I know the truth 
 You're a leprechaun, I see you through. 
 Is there a place deep within 
 A place where you hide you're darkest sins 
 There's a strange kind of ambiance, 
 Its surrounding you. 
 As a songstress you lure me, 
 Towards the truth.Blue eyes just smile to the world 
 Full of dreams and with fascination 
 Too soon she saw that her hands were chained and pulled without any freedom 
 It's always the same, they fear no way out 
 I cannot break it 
 I can take it no more 
 It's burning me up inside 
 Lost all my tears, can't cry 
 No reason, no meaning 
 Just hatred 
 No matter how hard I try 
 You fear the beast inside 
 It's growing, it's waiting 
 Just to hurt you 
 This heart was hurt by the light and 
 I see your world that tries to deny us 
 Now everything that I love has died or has been shattered to pieces 
 It's always the same, they fear no way out 
 I cannot break it 
 I can take it no more 
 Just to hurt you 
 Just hatred 
 Can't you see their eyes, what lies inside 
 They've given up, they no longer shine 
 Too soon they close with one last cry 
 Before they turn to light 
 Just to hurt youThe burnin' desire to live and roam free 
 It shines in the dark and it grows within me 
 You're holdin' my hand but you don't understand 
 So where I am goin' you won't be in the end 
 I'm dreamin' in colours, of gettin' the chance 
 Dreamin' of tryin' the, the perfect romance 
 The search of the door to open your mind 
 In search of the cure of mankind 
 Help us we're drownin' 
 So close up inside 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are? 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 How will the lights die down, tellin' us who we are? 
 I'm searchin' for answers not given for free 
 They're hurtin' inside as they lie within me 
 You're holdin' my hand but you don't understand 
 You're takin' the road all alone in the end 
 I'm dreamin' in colours, no boundaries are there 
 I'm dreamin' the dream we all seem to share 
 In search of the door to open your mind 
 In search of the cure of mankind 
 Help us we're drownin' 
 So close up inside 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are? 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 How will the lights die down, tellin' us who we are? 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are? 
 Why does it rain, rain, rain down on Utopia? 
 How will the lights die down, tellin' us who we are? 
 Why does it rain?I've been around these vicious lives too, too long to be neglecting the truth 
 I'm getting closer and I'm fully armed 
 I'm about to hunt you down through the big black hole right behind you 
 And I'm about to cut your wings away 
 'Cause I've been finding out where you've broken in 
 And I will take you out, when I close you in 
 I'm killing them all, I put my soul on the line 
 I purify sins that I committed in life 
 I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down 
 Wherever they go, I'm right behind 
 There's nowhere to go, your head on the line 
 There is no rope, you're running out of time 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soul? 
 I'm about to do it your way, I will make your world unsafe 
 I never thought you'd get this far, it's insane 
 You don't believe what all the signs say, don't believe in judgment day 
 But you won't be leaving here unharmed 
 'Cause I've been finding out where you've broken in 
 And I will take you out, when I close you in 
 I'm killing them all, I put my soul on the line 
 I purify sins that I committed in life 
 I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down 
 Wherever they go, I'm right behind 
 There's nowhere to go, your head on the line 
 There is no rope, you're running out of time 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soul? 
 You can feel the pain and scream in vain 
 You sink away to the bottom 
 You can't break your chains, break away from here 
 I'm killing them all, I put my soul on the line 
 I purify sins that I committed in life 
 I'll follow them all and I'll be bringing them down 
 Wherever they go, I'm right behind 
 There's nowhere to go, your head on the line 
 There is no rope, you're running out of time 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soul?Seven seconds till the rise 
 Can't believe I'm still alive 
 And heaven was waiting for me 
 I thought this would be the end 
 But I know you'll understand 
 All that is keeping me here 
 I dream of a stairway to the skies 
 My angel is coming down from heaven to take me 
 I reach out but then you fade away 
 Whenever you call for me 
 Know that I'm only one step behind 
 My senses tell me I have changed 
 But one thing still remains 
 I'm torn and the hate's still aching 
 I slowly start to realize 
 We won't reunite 
 I still have to march on through 
 I dream of a stairway to the skies 
 My angel is coming down from heaven to take me 
 I reach out but then you fade away 
 Whenever you call for me 
 Know that I'm only one step behind 
 Is it a curse or a virtue? 
 Have I been blinded by regret? 
 Perdition awaits 
 My soul is at stake 
 Will I find a stairway to the skies 
 In the end? 
 I dream of a stairway to the skies 
 My angel is coming down from heaven to take me 
 I reach out but then you fade away 
 Whenever you call for me 
 Know that I'm only one step behind 
 Know that I'm only one step behindWhen leaves have fallen, 
 And skies turned to grey, 
 The night keeps on closing in on the day. 
 A nightingale sings his song of farewell, 
 You better hide for her freezing hell. 
 On cold wings she's coming, 
 You better keep moving. 
 For warmth, you'll be longing. 
 Come on just feel it, 
 Don't you see it? 
 You better believe. 
 When she embraces, 
 Your heart turns to stone. 
 She comes at night when you are all alone. 
 And when she whispers, 
 Your blood shall run cold. 
 You better hide before she finds you. 
 Whenever she is raging, 
 She takes life away. 
 Haven't you seen, 
 Haven't you seen, 
 The ruins of our world? 
 Whenever she is raging, 
 She takes life away. 
 Haven't you seen, 
 Haven't you seen, 
 The ruins of our world? 
 She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak. 
 The sun awakes and melts it away. 
 The world now opens its eyes and it sees, 
 The dawning of the new day. 
 On cold wings she's coming, 
 You better keep moving. 
 For warmth, you'll be longing. 
 Come on just feel it, 
 Don't you see it? 
 You better believe. 
 Whenever she is raging, 
 She takes life away. 
 Haven't you seen, 
 Haven't you seen, 
 The ruins of our world? 
 Whenever she is raging, 
 She takes life away. 
 Haven't you seen, 
 Haven't you seen, 
 The ruins of our world?Birds and butterflies, 
 Rivers and mountains she creates. 
 But you'll never know 
 The next move she'll make. 
 You can try, 
 But it is useless to ask why. 
 Cannot control her; 
 She goes her own way. 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time. 
 She gives and she takes. 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time. 
 She goes her way. 
 With every breath, 
 And all the choices that we make. 
 We are only passing through, 
 On her way. 
 I find my strength, 
 Believing that their soul lives on. 
 Until the end of time, 
 I'll carry it with me. 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time. 
 She gives and she takes. 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time. 
 She goes her way. 
 Once you will know my dear, 
 You don't have to fear. 
 (You don't have to fear) 
 A new beginning, 
 Always starts at the end. 
 Once you will know my dear, 
 You don't have to fear. 
 Until the end of time, 
 (Until the end of time) 
 Until the end of time, 
 (Until the end of time) 
 Until the end of time, 
 She goes her way! 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time. 
 She gives and she takes. 
 She rules, 
 Until the end of time, 
 Until the end of time, 
 Until the end of time, 
 She goes her way.In the shadow awaits a desire that you know that you can't realize 
 And the pressure will just keep on rising, now the heat is on 
 It's too late, there is no way around it 
 You will see it in yourself many times 
 In the end you will give up to fight it, unescapable 
 'Cause you're losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the lies 
 Where is the edge of your darkest emotions? 
 Where does it all survive? 
 Where is the light of your deepest devotions? 
 I pray that it's still alive 
 It's the rule that you live by and die for, it's the one thing you cannot deny 
 Even though you don't know what the price is, it is justified 
 So much more that you've got left to fight for, but it still doesn't change who you are 
 There is no fear you'll ever give in to, you're untouchable 
 'Cause you're losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the night 
 Where is the edge of your darkest emotions? 
 Where does it all survive? 
 Where is the light of your deepest devotions? 
 I pray that it's still alive 
 You can't stop yourself, don't want to feel, don't want to see what you've become 
 You can't walk away from who you are, never give in 
 (Where is the edge?) 
 Where is the edge of your darkest emotions? 
 Where does it all survive? 
 Where is the light of your deepest devotions? 
 I pray that it's still aliveIt waits for the day I will let it out. 
 To give it a reason, to give it its might. 
 I fear who I am becoming, 
 I feel that I'm losing the struggle within. 
 I can no longer restrain it, 
 My strength, it is fading. 
 I have to give in. 
 It's the fear 
 Fear of the dark 
 It's growing inside of me, 
 That one day will come to life. 
 Have to save 
 To save my beloved, 
 There is no escape, 
 Because my fate is horror and doom. 
 Hold down your head now, 
 Just let me pass by. 
 Don't feed my fear, 
 If you don't want it out. 
 I fear who I am becoming, 
 I feel that I'm losing all beauty within. 
 I can no longer restrain it 
 My strength, it is fading. 
 I have to give in. 
 It's the fear 
 Fear of the dark 
 It's growing inside of me, 
 That one day will come to life. 
 Have to save 
 To save my beloved, 
 There is no escape, 
 Because my fate is horror and doom. 
 Long ago it came to me. 
 I'm ever since that day, 
 Infected with its rage, 
 But it ends today. 
 It's the fear 
 Fear of the dark 
 It's growing inside of me, 
 That one day will come to life. 
 Have to save 
 To save my beloved, 
 There is no escape, 
 Because my fate is horror and doom.It doesn't hurt me 
 Do you wanna feel how it feels? 
 Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? 
 Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? 
 You 
 It's you and me 
 And if I only could 
 I'd make a deal with God 
 And I'd get him to swap our places 
 Be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 Be running up that building 
 Say if I only could, oh 
 You don't want to hurt me 
 But see how deep the bullet lies 
 Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder 
 Ooh there is thunder in our hearts 
 Is there so much hate for the ones we love? 
 Tell me we both matter don't we? 
 You 
 It's you and me 
 It's you and me won't be unhappy 
 And if I only could 
 I'd make a deal with God 
 And I'd get him to swap our places 
 Be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 Be running up that building 
 Say if I only could, oh 
 You 
 It's you and me 
 It's you and me won't be unhappy 
 Oh c'mon baby 
 Oh c'mon darling 
 Let me steal this moment from you now 
 Come on angel 
 C'mon c'mon darling 
 Let's exchange the experience oh 
 And if I only could 
 I'd make a deal with God 
 And I'd get him to swap our places 
 I'd be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 With no problems 
 Say if I only could 
 I'd make a deal with God 
 And I'd get him to swap our places 
 I'd be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 With no problems 
 Say if I only could 
 I'd make a deal with God 
 And I'd get him to swap our places 
 I'd be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 With no problems 
 Say if I only could 
 Be running up that hill 
 With no problems 
 If I only could 
 Be running up that hill 
 If I only could 
 Be running up that hillI remember when 
 I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
 There was something so pleasant about that place 
 Even your emotions had an echo 
 In so much space 
 And when you're out there, without care 
 Yeah, I was out of touch 
 But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
 I just knew too much, mmm 
 Does that make me crazy? 
 Does that make me crazy? 
 Does that make me crazy? 
 Possibly 
 And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
 But think twice 
 That's my only advice, mmm 
 Come on now, who do you 
 Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? 
 Ha ha ha, bless your soul 
 You really think you're in control? 
 Well, I think you're crazy 
 I think you're crazy 
 I think you're crazy 
 Just like me 
 My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
 And all I remember 
 Is thinking, I want to be like them 
 Mmm, ever since I was little 
 Ever since I was little, it looked like fun 
 And it's no coincidence I've come 
 And I can die when I'm done 
 But maybe I'm crazy 
 Maybe you're crazy 
 Maybe we're crazy 
 Probably"Welcome to my home." 
 The gates of time have opened, 
 Now, the chains are broken. 
 An ancient force unleashed again. 
 As I enter the portal, 
 I feel the enchantment. 
 It takes me away, away from here. 
 Come near me, 
 Enter my private chambers. 
 I want to feel the warmth on my face. 
 Light-in darkness, 
 Lift me up from here. 
 Give me your wings, 
 To flee from my ivory tower. 
 As I enter the portal, 
 I feel the enchantment. 
 The stars above are lying at my feet. 
 Come near me, 
 Enter my private chambers. 
 I want to feel the warmth on my face. 
 Light-in darkness, 
 Lift me up from here. 
 Give me your wings, 
 To flee from my ivory tower.No one knows what it's like 
 To be the bad man 
 To be the sad man 
 Behind blue eyes 
 No one knows what it's like 
 To be hated 
 To be fated 
 To telling only lies 
 But my dreams, they aren't as empty 
 As my conscience seems to be 
 I have hours, only lonely 
 My love is vengeance 
 That's never free 
 No one knows what it's like 
 To feel these feelings 
 Like I do 
 And I blame you 
 No one bites back as hard 
 On their anger 
 None of my pain and woe 
 Can show through 
 But my dreams, they aren't as empty 
 As my conscience seems to be 
 I have hours, only lonely 
 My love is vengeance 
 That's never free 
 When my fist clenches, crack it open 
 Before I use it and lose my cool 
 When I smile, tell me some bad news 
 Before I laugh and act like a fool 
 And if I swallow anything evil 
 Put your finger down my throat 
 And if I shiver, please give me a blanket 
 Keep me warm, let me wear your coat 
 No one knows what it's like 
 To be the bad man 
 To be the sad man 
 Behind blue eyesThere was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes 
 In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne 
 Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall 
 I hear the songs from the places where I was born 
 Upon the hill across the blue lake 
 That's where I had my first heartbreak 
 I still remember how it all changed 
 My father said 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
 See heaven's got a plan for you 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
 Yeah! 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
 See heaven's got a plan for you 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
 Yeah! 
 There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind 
 We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight 
 We were so young, I think of her now and then 
 I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend 
 Upon the hill across the blue lake 
 That's where I had my first heartbreak 
 I still remember how it all changed 
 My father said 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
 See heaven's got a plan for you 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
 Yeah! 
 Ohh... 
 Ooh... 
 Ohh... 
 See heaven's got a plan for you 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
 See heaven's got a plan for you 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
 Yeah! 
 Ohh... 
 Ooh... 
 Ohh... 
 Yeah!For the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes 
 Won't repent to a mortal whom is all to blame 
 Now I know I won't make it 
 There will be a time we'll get back our freedom 
 They can't break what's inside 
 I'll face it 'cause it's the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes 
 Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go 
 Open up your eyes 
 See what you've become, don't sacrifice 
 It's truly the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes, open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes, it's the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes, open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes, open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes 
 Stay with me now I'm facing my last solemn hour 
 Very soon I'll embrace you on the other side 
 Hear the crowd in the distance, screaming out my faith 
 Now their voices are fading, I can feel no more pain 
 I'll face it 'cause it's the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes 
 Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go 
 Open up your eyes 
 See what you've become, don't sacrifice 
 It's truly the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes 
 Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go 
 Open up your eyes 
 See what you've become, don't sacrifice 
 It's truly the heart of everythingIf I tell you 
 Will you listen? 
 Will you stay? 
 Will you be here forever? 
 Never go away? 
 Never thought things would change 
 Hold me tight 
 Please don't say again 
 That you have to go 
 A bitter thought 
 I had it all 
 But I just let it go 
 Oh, this silence 
 It's so violent 
 Since your're gone 
 All my thoughts are with you forever 
 Until the day we'll be back together 
 I will be waiting for you 
 If I had told you 
 You would have listened 
 You had stayed 
 You would be here forever 
 Never went away 
 It would never have been the same 
 All our time 
 Would have been in vain 
 Cause you had to go 
 The sweetest thought 
 I had it all 
 'Cause I did let you go 
 All our moments 
 Keep me warm 
 When you're gone 
 All my thoughts are with you forever 
 Until the day we'll be back together 
 I will be waiting for youI'm on a road of broken dreams 
 And I need to know why. 
 Seek the truth through lies to be my guide. 
 I'm in a world of doubt and trust, can't deny 
 I lost my way here in this quest, can't lie. 
 I can't believe what's happening, 
 I don't know what to say. 
 I can't believe I'd live to see this day. 
 I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind, 
 And I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time, 
 And I don't wanna live in fear, but I can't change what's wrong, 
 But I know, won't be living in a lie. 
 Oh, I'll be hanging on the cross 
 When I put the nails in. 
 It's time to choose a road that we believe in. 
 You say you understand it all, try and smile; 
 If only I could see it's true somehow. 
 I can't believe what's happening, 
 I don't know what to say. 
 And what I wouldn't give to change our fate... 
 I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind, 
 And I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time, 
 And I don't wanna live in fear, but I can change what's wrong, 
 But I know, won't be living in a lie. 
 And I've tried so hard to hold on, 
 But I keep on falling. 
 And no matter how hard I run, 
 I just keep returning, 
 And I'm back to where I started from. 
 I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind 
 And I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time. 
 I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind, 
 And I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time, 
 And I don't wanna live in fear, but I can change what's wrong, 
 But I know, won't be living in a lie.Your back against the wall 
 Take or leave it all 
 Only this lifetime 
 Is it worth it all? 
 Run or take the fall 
 Only this lifetime with me 
 With arms open wide 
 Just living on fire 
 I leaned out my hand 
 With arms open wide 
 It's all that I can 
 There's nothing I hide 
 Living on fire, fire 
 Feel it all 
 Living on fire, fire 
 With arms wide open 
 Living on fire, fire 
 Feel it all 
 Fire, fire 
 With arms wide open 
 Your back against the wall 
 Take or leave it all 
 Only this lifetime 
 Is it worth it all? 
 Run or take the fall 
 Only this lifetime with me

 With arms wide open 
 Living on fire, fire 
 Feel it all 
 Fire, fire 
 With arms wide openWhere are the heroes in my time of need? 
 Is my cry not loud enough, or have they gone all numb? 
 They just tend to stand out of the rain, 
 Thinking but not acting that they're not to blame. 
 Falling and crawling, 
 A fight to stand up; 
 Memory still haunts me 
 In the dead of night. 
 Over and over 
 I felt so small. 
 But one day I'll be stronger, 
 And you'd better watch out. 
 I will overcome 
 Your violence, their silence 
 Although it can't be undone. 
 I will overcome, 
 Knowing that I'm not the only one. 
 I will overcome; 
 It's the only way to carry on. 
 Where are the saviours, afraid of the toll? 
 Sorry, do my nine inch nails slash your soul? 
 Such heroes, throwing stones 
 Straight at the one who is standing alone. 
 Twisting and turning, 
 It's always the same: 
 Truth is never honest 
 When you're to blame 
 Pushing and pulling, 
 I never give in; 
 But one day I wish you'll see 
 You're not so beautiful within. 
 I will overcome 
 Your violence your silence 
 Although, 
 It can't be undone 
 I will overcome 
 Knowing that I'm not the only one 
 I will overcome 
 It's the only way to carry on 
 Run and run 
 Run and run 
 I will overcome 
 Their violence your silence 
 Although, 
 It can't be undone 
 I will overcome 
 Knowing that I'm not the only one 
 I will overcome 
 It's the only way to carry on 
 I will overcomeDetermined by your faith you attempt to make up. 
 You lay out your case like the enemy. 
 But all that you got through dirty white lies, 
 You'll find the damn correct way of blaming me for your crimes 
 Wont you talk to me? 
 Don't walk or run away. 
 I'm onto you, yesterday 
 With empty eyes. 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 In search for answers. 
 I don't know who I'm fighting, 
 I stand with empty eyes. 
 You're like the ghost within me 
 Who's draining my life 
 It's like my soul is see through 
 Right through my empty eyes, 
 Right through my empty eyes. 
 I'm about to give in, I got nowhere to go. 
 Afraid of the sins, I'm holding on. 
 There's no other way, no doubt in the end, 
 But I ain't got a thing to lose, nothing to defend. 
 Wont you talk to me? 
 Don't walk or run away. 
 I'm onto you, yesterday 
 With empty eyes. 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 In search for answers. 
 I don't know who I'm fighting, 
 I stand with empty eyes. 
 You're like the ghost within me 
 Who's draining my life 
 It's like my soul is see through 
 Right through my empty eyes. 
 Ooh, please, won't you give in to me? 
 Won't you finally speak truthfully? 
 Determined by your faith you attempt to make up. 
 You lay out your case like the enemy, like the enemy. 
 With empty eyes. 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 In search for answers. 
 I don't know who I'm fighting, 
 I stand with empty eyes. 
 You're like the ghost within me 
 Who's draining my life 
 It's like my soul is see through 
 Right through my empty eyes, 
 Right through my empty eyes.There's no sense, the fire burns 
 When wisdom fails it changes all 
 The wheel embodies all that keeps on turnin' 
 Blood red skies, I feel so cold 
 No innocence, we play our role 
 The wheel embodies all, where are we goin'? 
 All in all you'd expect the wise to be wiser 
 Fallen from grace and 
 All and all I guess we should have known better, 'cause 
 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 No, we're not in paradise 
 This is who we are, this is what we've got 
 No, it's not our paradise 
 But it's all we want and it's all that we're fightin' for 
 Though it's not paradise 
 You and us, or I and them 
 There comes a time to take a stand 
 The wheel is watchin' all that keeps on burnin' 
 The venom works, it's like a curse 
 A Trojan horse, when will we learn? 
 The wheel embodies all, that keeps returnin' 
 All in all you'd expect the wise to be wiser 
 Fallen from grace and 
 All and all I guess we should have known better, 'cause 
 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 No, we're not in paradise 
 This is who we are, this is what we've got 
 No, it's not our paradise 
 But it's all we want and it's all that we're fightin' for 
 Though it's not paradise 
 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 No, we're not in paradise 
 This is who we are, this is what we've got 
 No, it's not our paradise

 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 No, we're not in paradise 
 This is who we are, this is what we've got 
 No, it's not our paradise 
 But it's all we want and it's all that we're fightin' for 
 But it's not paradise

 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 What about us? What about us? 
 What about us? Isn't it enough? 
 What about us? What about us? 
 What about us? Isn't it enough?Every word you're saying is a lie 
 Run away my dear 
 But every sign will say your heart is deaf 
 Bury all the memories 
 Cover them with dirt 
 Where's the love we once had 
 Our destiny's unsure 
 Why can't you see what we had 
 Let the fire burn the ice 
 Where's the love we once had 
 Is it all a lie? 
 And I still wonder 
 Why our heaven has died 
 The skies are all falling 
 I'm breathing but why? 
 In silence I hold on 
 To you and I 
 Closer to insanity 
 Buries me alive 
 Where's the life we once had 
 It cannot be denied 
 Why can't you see what we had 
 Let the fire burn the ice 
 Where's the love we once had 
 Is it all a lie? 
 And I still wonder 
 Why our heaven has died 
 The skies are all falling 
 I'm breathing but why? 
 In silence I hold on 
 To you and I 
 You run away 
 You hide away 
 To the other side of the universe 
 Where you're safe from all that hunts you down 
 But the world is gone 
 Where you belong 
 And it feels too late so you're moving on 
 But can you find your way back home? 
 And I still wonder 
 Why our heaven has died 
 The skies are all falling 
 I'm breathing but why? 
 In silence I hold on 
 To you and I 
 Every word you're saying is a lie.We've been seein' what you wanted 
 Got us cornered right now 
 Fallen asleep from our vanity 
 Might cost us our lives 
 I hear they're gettin' closer 
 Their howls are sendin' chills down my spine 
 And time is runnin' out now 
 They're comin' down the hills from behind 
 When we start killin' 
 It's all comin' down right now 
 From the nightmare we've created 
 I want to be awakened somehow 
 (I want to be awakened right now) 
 When we start killin' 
 It all will be fallin' down 
 From the hell that we're in 
 All we are is fadin' away 
 When we start killin' 
 We've been searchin' all night long 
 But there's no trace to be found 
 It's like they all have just vanished 
 But I know they're around 
 I feel they're gettin' closer 
 Their howls are sendin' chills down my spine 
 And time is runnin' out now 
 They're comin' down the hills from behind 
 When we start killin' 
 It's all comin' down right now 
 From the nightmare we've created 
 I want to be awakened somehow 
 (I want to be awakened right now) 
 When we start killin' 
 It all will be fallin' down 
 From the hell that we're in 
 All we are is fadin' away 
 When we start killin' 
 When we start killin' 
 I feel they're gettin' closer 
 Their howls are sendin' chills down my spine 
 And time is runnin' out now 
 They're comin' down the hills from behind 
 The sun is risin', the screams have gone 
 Too many have fallen, few still stand tall 
 Is this the endin' of what we've begun? 
 Will we remember what we've done wrong? 
 When we start killin' 
 It's all comin' down right now 
 From the nightmare we've created 
 I want to be awakened somehow 
 (I want to be awakened right now) 
 When we start killin' 
 It all will be fallin' down 
 From the hell that we're in 
 All we are is fadin' away 
 When we start killin' 
 When we start killin' 
 When we start killin'Cannot swallow the soil, make it all beautiful 
 Cannot carry you, carry you, carry you now 
 The truth can't bear the sunlight, you're afraid for the day it does 
 And when I told you so 
 I got burned, burned, burned again 
 Heaven forbid that my heart is for sale 
 Hope in the end, truth prevails 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try. 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Need to find my way home, home. 
 You're as proud as a god 
 But I believed in your heart 
 And I'll be leaving you, leaving you, leaving you now 
 The truth can't bear the sunlight 
 And don't pretend to be my guide 
 You said you'd change it all but I got burned, burned, burned instead 
 Heaven can wait cause my soul ain't for sale 
 Hope in the end, truth prevails 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try. 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Need to find my way home, home. 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try. 
 I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world. 
 Need to find my way home, home. 
 Justify 
 No more lies 
 Once upon a timeI feel my heart explode to particles 
 Love is always here and I told you so 
 Restless in dreams, love carved in stone 
 This rhapsody of life, in a way 
 I guess we all know it 
 Hand in hand we stand while we watch it flow 
 Heaven can you help us? No we can't go 
 Covered by roses 
 When this dance is over 
 We all know our beauty will die 
 The choirs have awoken 
 Left no words unspoken 
 Remember you as long as I can 
 Hold you in my arms all night 
 And spill the wine until the end 
 We all have our place in time 
 Need to live every moment 
 We built our castles high, turned our dreams to gold 
 We took the blows with pride, went through it all 
 The dawn is closing in, new tales are told 
 This rhapsody of life, in a way 
 I guess we all know 
 Covered by roses 
 When this dance is over 
 We all know our beauty will die 
 The choirs have awoken 
 Left no words unspoken 
 Remember you as long as I can 
 Hold you in my arms all night 
 And spill the wine until the end 
 We all have our place in time 
 Need to live every moment 
 For all we are is falling stars in the night 
 A blinding light raging down from the sky 
 The rise and fall, the rhapsody of our lives 
 So we all let go, we gotta let go 
 She dwells with beauty, beauty that must die 
 And joy, whose hand is ever at his lips 
 His soul shall taste the sadness of her might 
 And be among her butty trophies hung 
 Covered by, covered by 
 Covered by roses 
 When this dance is over 
 We all know our beauty will die 
 The choirs have awoken 
 Left no words unspoken 
 Remember you as long as I can 
 Hold you in my arms all night 
 And spill the wine until the end 
 We all have our place in time 
 Need to live every momentI've been dreaming for so long, 
 To find a meaning to understand. 
 The secret of life, 
 Why am I here to try again? 
 Will I always, will you always 
 See the truth when it stares you in the face? 
 Will I ever, will I never free myself 
 By breaking these chains? 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back, it's my fault. 
 Your destiny is forlorn, 
 Have to live till it's undone. 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way. 
 I've been living for so long, 
 Many seasons passed me by. 
 I've seen kingdoms through ages 
 Rise and fall, I've seen it all. 
 Seen the horror, seen the wonders 
 Happening just in front of my eyes. 
 Will I ever, will I never free myself by making it right? 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back, it's my fault. 
 Your destiny is forlorn, 
 Have to live till it's undone. 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way. 
 Jillian our dream ended long ago. 
 All our stories and all our glory I held so dear. 
 We won't be together 
 For ever and ever, no more tears. 
 I'll always be here 'til the end. 
 Jillian, no more tears... 
 Jillian, no more tears... 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back, it's my fault. 
 Your destiny is forlorn, 
 Have to live till it's undone. 
 I'd give my heart, give my soul 
 I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.Take away, 
 These hands of darkness. 
 Reaching for my soul. 
 Now, the cold wind 
 Blows out my candles. 
 Feeling, 
 Only fear, 
 Without any hope. 
 A thousand dark moons. 
 A thousand winters long. 
 A million fallen stars, 
 The candle burns in the womb 
 We try not to forget, 
 They live through us. 
 Slowly they die away at every candle's end 
 A thousand dark moons, 
 A thousand winters long. 
 A million fallen stars, 
 The candle burns in the womb. 
 We try not to forget, 
 They live through us 
 Slowly they die away at every candle's end.You live your life 
 You go day by day 
 Like nothing can go wrong 
 Then scars are made 
 They're changing the game 
 You learn to play it hard 
 And I know you wish for more, 
 And I know you try, 
 And I hope you realize 
 You know the time is right 
 The whole world is watching when you rise 
 The whole world is beating for you right now 
 Your whole life is flashing for your eyes 
 It's all in this moment that changes all 
 What are you waiting for? 
 What are you fighting for? 
 'Cause time's always slipping away 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise 
 You build your walls 
 And break them away 
 'Cause that is what it takes 
 You've saved yourself 
 You've found who you are 
 That never goes away 
 And I know you wish for more, 
 And I know you try, 
 And I hope you realize 
 You know the time is right 
 The whole world is watching when you rise 
 The whole world is beating for you right now 
 Your whole life is flashing for your eyes 
 It's all in this moment that changes all 
 What are you waiting for? 
 What are you fighting for? 
 Cause time's always slipping away 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise 
 Your sacrifice goes through your mind 
 But nothing is wasted 
 You've made it now 
 You'll rise again 
 Breaking out 
 Each step that you've taken 
 You've paid the price 
 The whole world is watching 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise 
 What are you waiting for? 
 What are you fighting for? 
 'Cause time's always slipping away 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you riseThe child without a name grew up to be the hand 
 To watch you, to shield you or kill on demand 
 The choice he'd made he could not comprehend 
 His blood a grim secret they had to command 
 He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life 
 He prayed for both but was denied 
 So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed 
 Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind? 
 So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise? 
 Will all our sins be justified? 
 The curse of his powers tormented his life 
 Obeying the crown was a sinister price 
 His soul was tortured by love and by pain 
 He surely would flee but the oath made him stay 
 He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life 
 He prayed for both but was denied 
 So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed 
 Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind? 
 So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise? 
 Will all our sins be justified? 
 Please forgive me for the sorrow, for leaving you in fear 
 For the dreams we had to silence, that's all they'll ever be 
 Still I'll be the hand that serves you 
 Though you'll not see that it is me 
 So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed 
 Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind? 
 So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise? 
 Will all our sins be justified?I know I won't change, I have tried 
 Was feelin' so caged, hands tied 
 I can't find anything feelin' so right 
 It's blindin' hope 
 The Reaper is close, seen his smile 
 A matter of time, can't deny 
 I won't turn around, 'round, 'round 
 This destiny's mine 
 The countdown has begun 
 The walls are fallin' down 
 My life is on the line 
 The freedom is mine 
 It's dangerous to sacrifice 
 It makes your blood run to throw the dice 
 It's dangerous, it's what you like 
 It's what you'll die for to live this life 
 We're goin' on and we'll never stop 
 We're goin' on till our worlds collide 
 It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous 
 I know it's not safe, close my eyes 
 I search for the edge of life 
 'Cause that's the only place I'll ever find 
 That makes me whole 
 A thief in the night, out of sight 
 It's out there waiting, to ignite 
 The fever will rise, rise, rise 
 Taking over my mind 
 The countdown has begun 
 (Countdown has begun) 
 The walls are fallin' down 
 (Walls are fallin' down) 
 My life is on the line 
 (Life is on the line) 
 The freedom is mine 
 It's dangerous to sacrifice 
 It makes your blood run to throw the dice 
 It's dangerous, it's what you like 
 It's what you'll die for to live this life 
 We're goin' on and we'll never stop 
 We're goin' on till our worlds collide 
 It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous 
 Nothing matters anyhow, it's like I'm floating off the ground 
 Into the hands of air I dive, rays of light flashing by 
 Like the time is slowin' down, when the world is out of sight 
 All the memories in my mind won't leave me behind 
 It's dangerous 
 (Dangerous) 
 It's dangerous 
 (Dangerous) 
 It's dangerous 
 It's dangerous to sacrifice 
 It makes your blood run to throw the dice 
 It's dangerous, it's what you're like 
 It's what you'll die for to live this life 
 We're goin' on and we'll never stop 
 We're goin' on till our worlds collide 
 It's dangerous 
 (Dangerous) 
 So dangerous 
 (Dangerous) 
 DangerousThe darkness has come to the roses 
 The fire is reaching the air 
 The colours that I have created 
 Are suddenly flying away 
 I'm not fighting myself, will not follow 
 'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate 
 And I'll never bow down from the sorrow 
 I'll face all that is coming my way 
 The lying, the devil, the silence 
 Embracing the world on the edge 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 The night in the skies here tonight 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 In this fire that makes us yearn 
 We're fighting our fear of the silence 
 We're running through walls where they stand 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 I'm searching no more for tomorrow 
 I reach for the skies while I can 
 The unknown will always be waiting 
 My last day I'll jump in its hands 
 I'm not fighting myself, will not follow 
 'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate 
 And I'll never bow down from the sorrow 
 I'll face all that is coming my way 
 The lying, the devil, the silence 
 Embracing the world on the edge 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 The night in the skies here tonight 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 In this fire that makes us yearn 
 We're fighting our fear of the silence 
 We're running through walls where they stand 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 Why, why don't you let me burn? 
 Why don't you come down 
 And break out and let me burn? 
 Oh why, why don't you let me burn? 
 Why don't you let me burn? 
 Why don't you let me burn? 
 Oh why? 
 Chasing the demons in my mind 
 Oh why me? 
 Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground 
 The darkness has come to the roses 
 And the fire is reaching the air 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 The night in the skies here tonight 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 In this fire that makes us yearn 
 We're fighting our fear of the silence 
 We're running through walls where they stand 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burn 
 Let us burnTurn around, open your eyes 
 Can't move on, the fear is tyin' you down 
 Open your eyes 
 It's alright... 
 Oh! 
 I'm hellbound in this life 
 Keep fightin' this endless war 
 It's always been like this 
 I don't know why 
 Enslavement of your mind 
 Your fear, it ties me down 
 Goin' down, I won't bow 
 No! 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 They are closing in on me 
 (Closing in on me) 
 I'm hungry for the burnin' of the silver moonlight 
 It's where I wanna be 
 (Where I wanna be) 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 But I'm still runnin' free 
 (I'm still runnin' free) 
 In the silver moonlight 
 I can't breathe 
 (I can't breathe) 
 These days are lonely now 
 Breathin' in the coldest lies 
 I think that's only what you have in mind 
 Holdin' on to the best of you 
 I hit the pavement 
 Goin' down, I won't bow 
 Down! 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 They are closing in on me 
 (Closing in on me) 
 I'm hungry for the burnin' of the silver moonlight 
 It's where I wanna be 
 (Where I wanna be) 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 But I'm still runnin' free 
 (I'm still runnin' free) 
 In the silver moonlight 
 I can't breathe 
 I've been patient 
 But it's colors that I need 
 Too many shades of gray 
 I cannot breathe 
 (I can't breathe) 
 The dreams I haven't tainted 
 Need you to believe 
 The only way to make them real 
 Oh 
 (I can't breathe) 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 They are closing in on me 
 (Closing in on me) 
 I'm hungry for the burnin' of the silver moonlight 
 It's where I wanna be 
 (Where I wanna be) 
 Screamin' at the walls of fire 
 But I'm still runnin' free 
 (I'm still runnin' free) 
 In the silver moonlight 
 I can't breathe 
 (I can't breath) 
 Turn around, open your eyes 
 Can't move on, the fear is tyin' you down 
 Open your eyes 
 It's alright...Give me strength to face the truth, the doubt within my soul. 
 No longer I can justify the bloodshed in His name. 
 Is it a sin to seek the truth, the truth beneath the rose? 
 Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heaven's door. 
 I believed it would justify the means 
 It had a hold over me. 
 Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast 
 It is the darker side of me. 
 (Forgive me my sins) 
 The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. 
 Forgive me for what I have been 
 Forgive me my sins! 
 Pray for me 'cause I have lost my faith in holy wars. 
 Is paradise denied to me 'cause I can't take no more? 
 Has darkness taken over me, consumed my mortal soul? 
 All my virtues sacrificed, can Heaven be so cruel? 
 I believed it would justify the means 
 It had a hold over me. 
 (Forgive me my sins) 
 Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast 
 It is the darker side of me. 
 (Forgive me my sins) 
 The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. 
 Forgive me for what I have been 
 Forgive me my sins! 
 I'm hoping, I'm praying 
 I won't get lost between two worlds, 
 For all I have seen the truth lies in between. 
 Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done 
 Now that I know the darkest side of me. 
 How can blood be our salvation 
 And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times? 
 Will I learn what's truly sacred? 
 Will I redeem my soul? 
 Will truth set me free? 
 (Forgive me my sins) 
 Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast 
 It is the darker side of me. 
 (Forgive me my sins) 
 The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. 
 Forgive me for what I have been 
 Forgive me my sins! 
 Et est signum dies datus et tenebris 
 Mea culpa acta est fabula pereoThe world seems not the same, 
 Though I know nothing has changed. 
 It's all my state of mind, 
 I can't leave it all behind. 
 I have to stand up to be stronger. 
 I have to try to break free 
 From the thoughts in my mind. 
 Use the time that I have, 
 I can't say goodbye, 
 Have to make it right. 
 Have to fight, 'cause I know 
 In the end it's worthwhile, 
 That the pain that I feel slowly fades away. 
 It will be all right. 
 I know, should realise 
 Time is precious, it is worthwhile. 
 Despite how I feel inside, 
 Have to trust it will be all right. 
 Have to stand up to be stronger. 
 I have to try to break free 
 From the thoughts in my mind. 
 Use the time that I have, 
 I can't say goodbye, 
 Have to make it right. 
 Have to fight, 'cause I know 
 In the end it's worthwhile, 
 That the pain that I feel slowly fades away. 
 It will be all right. 
 Oh, this night is too long. 
 I have no strength to go on. 
 No more pain, I'm floating away. 
 Through the mist I see the face 
 Of an angel, who calls my name. 
 I remember you're the reason I have to stay. 
 I have to try to break free 
 From the thoughts in my mind. 
 Use the time that I have, 
 I can't say goodbye, 
 Have to make it right. 
 Have to fight, 'cause I know 
 In the end it's worthwhile, 
 That the pain that I feel slowly fades away. 
 It will be all right.Couldn't save you from the start 
 Love you so it hurts my soul 
 Can you forgive me for trying again 
 Your silence makes me hold my breath 
 Time has passed you by 
 Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world 
 Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own 
 Here I am left in silence 
 You gave up the fight 
 You left me behind 
 All that's done's forgiven 
 You'll always be mine 
 I know deep inside 
 All that's done's forgiven 
 I watched the clouds drifting away 
 Still the sun can't warm my face 
 I know it was destined to go wrong 
 You were looking for the great escape 
 To chase your demons away 
 Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world 
 Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own 
 And here I am left in silence 
 You gave up the fight 
 You left me behind 
 All that's done's forgiven 
 You'll always be mine 
 I know deep inside 
 All that's done's forgiven 
 I've been so lost since you've gone 
 Why not me before you? 
 Why did fate deceive me? 
 Everything turned out so wrong 
 Why did you leave me in silence? 
 You gave up the fight 
 You left me behind 
 All that's done's forgiven 
 You'll always be mine 
 I know deep inside 
 All that's done's forgivenShe sang for you last night, she heard you were calling, 
 Yearning in tears a thousand times. 
 Your spirit was floating, your spirit was searching 
 On a cloud of dreams. 
 A moon beam shines bright in the city of angels 
 Guiding the dreamers back to life, 
 And they'll do the same every tomorrow 
 Till the pain subsides. 
 Don't be scared now, 
 Close your eyes, 
 She holds guard tonight. 
 Go on forward, 
 No remorse, 
 Life will take its course. 
 She danced with you last night so you will remember 
 All you have shared, the lifetime. 
 The angels were watching and death will be waiting 
 Until the time is right. 
 Don't be scared now, 
 Close your eyes, 
 She holds guard tonight. 
 Go on forward, 
 No remorse, 
 Life will take its course. 
 Hold on to memories, 
 See what lies ahead. 
 Life will go on and we are one 
 With every step you take.Over the hills, lies a new beginning 
 Over the hills 
 Over the hills, there is a way I know it 
 Over the hills 
 You can't bring all the gloom 
 Your heart is frayed and so empty 
 You glorify the future 
 Living in a different world than me 
 The journey ends in death 
 You are giving up so easily 
 You are the other half of me 
 Over the hills 
 We are drifting apart 
 Chilled to the marrow, cause you don't want to go 
 'Cause we've got a different wish at heart 
 The amulet guides us to the other side 
 When I go down it's you who'll bleed 
 I'm not scared to die, as long as I'm with you 
 You are the other half of me 
 Over the hills, lies a new beginning 
 Over the hills 
 Over the hills, there is a way I know it 
 Over the hillsThe turn against 
 The world we know 
 Now our destiny 
 Will be decided 
 We have to send our brothers in arms 
 With pain in our heart 
 We watched them go 
 Will they return? 
 Truth is we had no choice 
 We'll try to shield those we can 
 No better world 
 Let this end 
 Mothers cry 
 Our boys die 
 But we'll stand till the endShe's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer

 In the heart of the forest; 
 Where birds are singing, 
 For the new born sun. 
 In the womb of the leaves, 
 On the branches of the trees; 
 Lies the treasure of the morning, 
 The Pearls of Light. 
 Carried away by the truculence of my world, 
 I got lost in the search for enlightenment; 
 The blue rain covered my roots, 
 And I forgot where I came from. 
 Carried away by the truculence of my world, 
 I got lost in the search for enlightenment; 
 The blue rain covered my roots, 
 And I forgot where I came from.We can be friends, 
 Of course we can. 
 Sorry did my nine-inch nails cut your soul? 
 Such a hero, throwing stones 
 To the one that really stands here all alone. 
 Crawling and crawling, 
 Can't get up. 
 All these years of silence, 
 But I won't give up. 
 See you suffer, 
 Holding me down. 
 One day I will be somebody, 
 You'd better watch out. 
 I will overcome. 
 In violence your silence can never be undone. 
 I will overcome, 
 Knowing that I'm not the only one. 
 I will overcome. 
 Maybe in the second round. 
 We can be friends, 
 Of course we can.

 In silence your violence can never be undone. 
 I will overcome,

 I will overcome. 
 Maybe in the second round. 
 Run.I know you're going away 
 I take my love into another day 
 In my thoughts you're with me 
 I fell in love with your ways 
 I know you're going away 
 Lead my heart into a daze 
 I know you're going away 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soul 
 I know you're going away 
 I take my love into another day 
 In my thoughts you're with me 
 I fell in love with your ways 
 I know you're going away 
 Lead my heart into a daze 
 I know you're going away 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soul 
 Wherever you are 
 Whatever you do 
 I feel the walls surrounding you 
 Wherever you are 
 Whatever you do 
 I know you are independent 
 But I'm trying to get through to you 
 Wherever you are 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't you know, it depends on you 
 I know you're going away 
 Lead my heart into a daze 
 I know you're going away 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soulWe've been dreaming for so long 
 Endless wisdom comes our way 
 And before he his time has 
 Never failing until the end 
 We'll always, we'll always 
 See the truthless skies in your face 
 We'll never, we'll never 
 See the love when having goodbye 
 If you want to belong 
 And never see you're facing 
 To feel the sorrow 
 And never see the truth 
 It's too long to belong 
 And never see your face 
 And never to be strong 
 We've been dreaming for so long 
 Can his words taken you way? 
 And before he his time has 
 Never faling until the end 
 We'll always, we'll always 
 See the truthless skies in your face 
 We'll never, we'll never 
 See the love when having goodbye 
 If you want to belong 
 And never see you're facing 
 To feel the sorrow 
 And never see the truth 
 It's too long to belong 
 And never see your face 
 And never to be strong 
 For how long? 
 The dream has sinned long ago 
 We tell our stories and endless worries found in here 
 We'll be together, for ever and ever 
 Found in here 
 We'll always be 
 If you want to belong 
 And never see you're facing 
 To feel the sorrow 
 And never see the truth 
 It's too long to belong 
 And never see your face 
 And never to be strongIn a world so far away 
 At the end of a closing day 
 A little child was born and raised 
 Deep in the forest on a hidden place 
 Mother never saw his face 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 The woods protected, fulfilled his needs 
 Fruit by birds, honey by bees 
 He found shelter under the trees 
 He grew up in their company 
 They became his family 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 A thousand seasons 
 They passed him by 
 So many times, have said goodbye 
 And when the spirits called out his name 
 To join forever, forever to stay 
 A forest spirit he became 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 In perfect harmonyFor so long I've tried 
 Could not close my eyes 
 When you became an outcast in this life 
 Again and again I try 
 To understand the demons inside your head 
 But the truth is 
 You love them to death 
 Now I know it's the last time I have tried 
 To lift you up, to make you fight 
 Nothing is ever easy in life 
 I can't change it if you don't 
 Have the will deep inside 
 I have been blind to 
 How you justify 
 Everything that you've wasted in this life 
 Got lost in the illusion 
 I'd find a solution for the demons in your head 
 But the truth is 
 You love them to death 
 Now I know it's the last time I have tried 
 To lift you up, to make you fight 
 Nothing is ever easy in life 
 I can't change it if you don't 
 Have the will deep inside 
 You can blame and you can hide 
 Behind what is wrong and what is right 
 Life is the choices we make 
 I hope you'll awake before it's too late 
 Now I know it's the last time I have tried 
 To lift you up, to make you fight 
 Nothing is ever easy in life 
 I can't change it if you don't 
 Have the will deep insideI did my best to please you 
 But my best was never good enough 
 Somehow you're only able to see 
 All I am not 
 Did you ever look behind? 
 Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find? 
 I have failed you, 
 But you have failed me too. 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand; 
 Do you ever wonder if it's justified? 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand. 
 In your life, why didn't you ever try? 
 I close my eyes as I walk 
 The thin line between love and hate 
 For the person with the same blood 
 In his veins. 
 You show no regrets 
 About all the things you did or said. 
 I have failed you, 
 But believe me, you failed me too! 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand; 
 Do you ever wonder if it's justified? 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand. 
 In your life, why didn't you ever try? 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if it's justified 
 It's so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if it's justifiedIn my hands 
 A legacy of memories 
 I can hear you say my name 
 I can almost see your smile 
 Feel the warmth of your embrace 
 But there is nothing but silence now 
 Around the one I loved 
 Is this our farewell? 
 Sweet darling 
 You worry too much, my child 
 See the sadness in your eyes 
 You are not alone in life 
 Although you might think that you are 
 Never thought 
 This day would come so soon 
 We had no time to say goodbye 
 How can the world just carry on? 
 I feel so lost when you are not by my side 
 But there is nothing but silence now 
 Around the one I loved 
 Is this our farewell? 
 Sweet darling 
 You worry too much, my child 
 See the sadness in your eyes 
 You are not alone in life 
 Although you might think that you are 
 So sorry your world is tumbling down 
 I will watch you through these nights 
 Rest your head and go to sleep 
 Because my child, 
 This is not our farewell 
 This is not our farewellHe feeds on fear 
 He feeds on pain 
 He rules again 
 With growing hate 
 He will gain 
 Their faith again 
 No light in the darkness 
 Is too small to see 
 There's always a sparkle of hope 
 If you just believe 
 He told the tale so many times 
 About the dream not meant to be 
 In a world of the free 
 Plays with your mind 
 As faith for the future faded fast 
 He grows strong with their displeasure 
 It sets him free 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules again 
 He feeds on fear 
 Poisons the truth 
 To gain their faith 
 To lead the way 
 To a world of decay 
 Rules your heart 
 He'll sell your soul to the grave 
 Without a hesitation to make 
 He belongs to the dark 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules again 
 Please awake 
 And see the truth 
 He can only be 
 If you believe what he tells you 
 Remember who you are 
 What you stand for 
 And there will always be a way 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules again 
 In my heart there is a place 
 In my heart there is a trace 
 Of a small fire burning 
 A sheltering ray shines through this night 
 Although it's small, it's bright 
 But darkness is lurking 
 He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold 
 Oh fear him 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 Deceiver of fools 
 Shall he rule again?I've been left out alone like a damn criminal 
 I've been praying for help 'cause I can't take it all 
 I'm not done, it's not over 
 Now I'm fighting this war since the day of the fall 
 And I'm desperately holding onto it all 
 But I'm lost, I'm so damn lost 
 Oh, I wish it was over and I wish you were here 
 Still I'm hoping that somehow 
 'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart? 
 I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands 
 But what can I do? Don't let it fall apart 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 In the blink of an eye I can see through your eyes 
 As I'm lying awake I'm still hearing the cries 
 And it hurts, hurts me so bad 
 And I'm wondering why I still fight in this life 
 'Cause I've lost all my faith in this damned bitter strife 
 And it's sad, it's so damn sad 
 Oh, I wish it was over and I wish you were here 
 Still I'm hoping that somehow 
 'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart? 
 I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands 
 But what can I do? Don't let it fall apart 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 I feel you fading away 
 I feel you fading away 
 I feel you fading away 
 I feel you fading away 
 'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart? 
 I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands 
 But what can I do? Don't let it fall apart 
 Oh, your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart? 
 I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands 
 But what can I do? Don't let it fall apart 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the dark 
 A shot in the darkWhy, you just won't leave my mind? 
 Was this the only way? 
 I couldn't let you stay? 
 Run away, hide away 
 The secrets in your mind 
 Sacrificed just her life 
 For a higher love 
 No matter how many stones you put inside 
 She'll always keeps on floating in your mind 
 With every turn of your head you see her face again 
 Until the end, over and over again 
 Why, you just won't leave my mind? 
 Was this the only way? 
 I couldn't let you stay? 
 Told the truth she laughed at you 
 Something snapped inside 
 She had to go or they would know 
 All you tried to hide 
 The sins of your life are now catching up with you 
 You can't stay ahead. There's nothing you can do 
 With every turn of your head you see her face again 
 Until the end, over and over again 
 Why, you just won't leave my mind? 
 Was this the only way? 
 I couldn't let you stay? 
 Why, you just won't leave my mind? 
 Was this the only way? 
 I couldn't let you stay? 
 Why, you just won't leave my mind? 
 Was this the only way? 
 I couldn't let you stay?( 
 Spoken by Mother Maiden 
 ) 
 Some may call it a curse... 
 A life like mine 
 But others, a blessing 
 It's certainly a lonely life 
 But a fulfilling one at best 
 It's my cross to bear 
 And I bear it gladly 
 Someone has to take a stand against evil 
 Why should it not be me?Someone is dancing 
 On my grave 
 Sending shivers 
 Down my spine 
 I hear a laugh, 
 It awoke my soul 
 The wind takes the leaves 
 Where he wants them to go 
 His tunes enchant our world, 
 Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
 In this heart of mine, 
 It's you I find 
 Take my hand, 
 I'll take you to the promised land, 
 You're the one 
 I hear a laugh, 
 It awoke my soul, 
 The wind takes the leaves 
 Where he wants them to go 
 His tunes, enchant our world, 
 Our thoughts, and leave us frozen 
 Take my hand, 
 I'll take you to the promised land 
 Nevil, whatever you have done, 
 These tears will fade. 
 Nevil, wherever you have gone, 
 Please, have faithI'm holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the ground 
 And I'm hearing what you say 
 But I just can't make a sound 
 You tell me that you need me 
 Then you go and cut me down, but wait 
 You tell me that you're sorry 
 Didn't think I'd turn around, and say 
 That it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I'd take another chance 
 Take a fall, take a shot for you 
 And I need you like a heart needs a beat 
 But it's nothing new, yeah 
 I loved you with a fire red 
 Now it's turning blue, and you say 
 Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you 
 But I'm afraid 
 It's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 It's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late 
 I'm holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the groundThese are the darkest clouds, 
 They have surrounded me. 
 Now I find my self alone caught in a cage. 
 There's no flower I can find in here; 
 Not withering, 
 Not pale to me. 
 Everyone with a friendly face, 
 Seems to hide some secret inside. 
 He told me he loved me. 
 While he laughed in my face, 
 He just led me astray. 
 He took my virtue. 
 I feel so cold inside, 
 Sorrow has frozen my mind. 
 My heart is covered, 
 With thoughts entangled. 
 How could it ever have felt so real? 
 Is there a place more lonely than I feel within? 
 Could I have seen? 
 Could I have known? 
 I just took it as the truth. 
 Everyone with a friendly face, 
 Seems to hide some secret inside. 
 He told me he loved me. 
 While he laughed in my face, 
 He just led me astray. 
 He took my virtue. 
 I feel so cold inside, 
 Sorrow has frozen my mind. 
 Always there to remind me, 
 It keeps me from believing. 
 That someone might be there, 
 Who'll free me and never ever leave me.I've been losin' myself in anger 
 So much broken by the rage 
 Nothin' could take my mind off 
 How to make them pay 
 Killin' myself for nothin' 
 And the pain won't go away 
 Losin' myself to madness 
 And the game's been played 
 If I could turn 
 The hands of time I would 
 But here I am 
 Tell me why am I still here when it's all gone? 
 I'm livin' with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still tryin' to hold on? 
 I've got to tear it down to let it go 
 I'm too tired to keep on tryin' 
 But I'm spellbound till the end 
 Knowin' that there's no closure 
 For my wars inside 
 I've buried the good and evil 
 Only memories left behind 
 I am the one still standin' 
 I will live to tell 
 If I could turn 
 The hands of time I would 
 But here I am 
 Here I am! 
 Tell me why am I still here when it's all gone? 
 I'm livin' with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still tryin' to hold on? 
 I've got to tear it down to let it go 
 Tell me why I'm wastin' away 
 (Wastin' away) 
 Tell me how to break my own chains 
 (Break my own chains) 
 'Cause I'm losin' after all 
 How can I escape this grim fate? 
 (Escape this grim fate) 
 Tell me how to face one more day 
 (Face one more day) 
 'Cause I'm wastin' away 
 It's all gone silent 
 I'm searchin' for fire 
 Nothin' to fight for alone 
 Tell me why am I still here when it's all gone? 
 I'm livin' with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still here when it's all gone? 
 I'm livin' with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still tryin' to hold on? 
 I've got to tear it down to let it goWhy was I one of the chosen ones? 
 Until the fight I could not see, 
 The magic and the strength of my power; 
 It was beyond my wildest dreams. 
 Dark wings they are descending, 
 See shadows gathering around. 
 One by one they are falling, 
 Every time they try to strike us down. 
 Don't you die on me, 
 You haven't made your peace. 
 Live a life, breathe, breathe. 
 Don't you die on me, 
 You haven't made your peace. 
 Live a life, breathe, breathe. 
 Dark wings they are descending, 
 See shadows gathering around. 
 One by one they are falling, 
 Every time they try to strike us down. 
 As they took your soul away, 
 The night turned into the day. 
 Blinded by your rays of life, 
 Gave us the strength we needed. 
 Dark wings they are descending, 
 See shadows gathering around. 
 One by one they are falling, 
 Every time they try to strike us. 
 Dark wings they are descending, 
 See shadows gathering around. 
 One by one they are falling, 
 Every time they try to strike us down.She embraced with a smile 
 As she opened the door 
 A cold wind blows 
 It puts a chill 
 Into her heart 
 You have taken away the trust 
 You're the ghost haunting through her heart 
 Past and present are one in her head 
 You're the ghost haunting through her heart 
 Take my hand as I wander through 
 All of my life I gave to you 
 Take my hand as I wander through 
 All of my love I gave to you 
 You have taken away the trust 
 You're the ghost haunting through her heart 
 Past and present are one in her head 
 You're the ghost haunting through her heart

 We are forsaken this time. 
 We lived our lives in our paradise, 
 As gods we shaped the world around. 
 No borderlines we'd stay behind, 
 Though balance is something fragile. 
 While we thought we were gaining, 
 We'd turn back the tide, it still slips away. 
 Our time has run out, our future has died, 
 There's no more escape. 
 Now the day has come, 
 We are forsaken, 
 There's no time anymore. 
 Life will pass us by, 
 We are forsaken, 
 We're the last of our kind. 
 The sacrifice was much too high, 
 Our greed just made us all go blind. 
 We tried to hide what we feared inside. 
 Today is the end of tomorrow. 
 As the sea started rising, 
 The land that we conquered just washed away. 
 Although we all have tried to turn back the tide, 
 It was all in vain. 
 Now the day has come, 
 We are forsaken, 
 There's no time anymore. 
 Life will pass us by, 
 We are forsaken, 
 Only ruins stay behind. 
 Now the day has come. 
 We are forsaken this time. 
 Now the day has come, 
 We are forsaken, 
 There's no time anymore. 
 Now the day has come. 
 The day has come. 
 The day has come.I'm waking up to ash and dust 
 I wipe my brow and sweat my rust 
 I'm breathing in the chemicals 
 I'm breaking in and shaping up 
 Then checking out on the prison bus 
 This is it, the apocalypse, whoa 
 I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
 Enough to make my system blow 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 I raise my flag, dye my clothes 
 It's a revolution, I suppose 
 We're painted red to fit right in, whoa 
 I'm breaking in and shaping up 
 Then checking out on the prison bus 
 This is it, the apocalypse, whoa 
 I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
 Enough to make my system blow 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 All systems go, the sun hasn't died 
 Deep in my bones, straight from inside 
 I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
 Enough to make my system blow 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive 
 Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactiveNothing's ever changed, you still turn away 
 You've washed your hands, you've made that all too clear 
 You just keep on living this lie 
 You refuse to see, you're denying me 
 The cross I bear but you don't seem to care 
 Even Judas knew he had lied 
 I keep wondering why 
 I'm still calling your name through my tears 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear? 
 Cold is your silence, denying what is real 
 I'm still wondering why 
 I'm still calling your name my dear 
 I'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truth 
 All you see is how you want it to be 
 So you keep on living your life 
 Release me from this cross after all these years 
 Oh call my name and help me with this weight 
 Even though it comes far too late 
 I keep wondering why 
 I'm still calling your name through my tears 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear 
 Cold is your silence, denying what is real 
 I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name 
 And I wonder, oh I wonder ... 
 In my heart I still hope you will open the door 
 You can purify it all, answer my call 
 Why? Why? 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear? 
 Cold is your silence, denying what is real 
 I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name 
 And I wonder, oh I wonder ... 
 In my heart I still hope you will open the door 
 You can purify it all, answer my callI escaped my final moment 
 But it's turning back at me 
 On every corner I can feel it waiting 
 Just a moment, no awareness 
 I could easily slip away 
 And then I'll be gone forever 
 I'm searching, 
 I'm fighting for a way to get through 
 To turn it away 
 It's waiting, always trying 
 I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 Is it all inside my head 
 Can't take it no more! 
 All around me I see danger 
 And it's closing in on me 
 Every second I can hear it breathing 
 I can't stand the fear inside me 
 'Cause it's leading me astray 
 And it will be my ending 
 I'm searching 
 I'm fighting for a way to get through 
 To turn it away 
 It's waiting, always trying 
 I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 Is it all inside my head 
 Can't take it no more! 
 But no one faced what's coming my way 
 And I will let my fear fade away 
 Whatever may be, I'll have to find out 
 It's waiting, always trying 
 I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 Is it all inside my head 
 Can't take it no moreCold are the bones of thy soldiers 
 Longing for home, their little paradise 
 I don't feel redemption on their side 
 Fallen from grace, help me rise again 
 Fallen from grace, help me through 
 Fallen from grace, help me through 
 Fallen from grace 
 Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble 
 Do you hear these words? 
 Do you feel the wounds? 
 I'll never help you through 
 Cold are thy souls 
 I feel the resentment, 
 They feel betrayed 
 They hate the cold 
 I don't feel redemption on their side 
 Fallen from grace, help me rise again 
 Fallen from grace, help me throughI can see 
 When you stay low 
 Nothing happens 
 Does it feel right? 
 Late at night 
 Things I thought I'd put behind me 
 Haunt my mind 
 I just know there's no escape now 
 Once it sets its eyes on you 
 But I won't run 
 Have to stare it in the eyes 
 Stand my ground 
 I won't give in 
 No more denying 
 I've gotta face it 
 Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I don't make it, someone else will 
 Stand my ground 
 It's all around 
 Getting stronger, coming closer into my world 
 I can feel that it's time for me to face it 
 Can I take it? 
 Though this might just be the ending 
 Of the life I held so dear 
 But I won't run 
 There's no turning back from here 
 Stand my ground 
 I won't give in 
 No more denying 
 I've gotta face it 
 Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I don't make it, someone else will 
 Stand my ground 
 All I know for sure is that I'm trying 
 I will always stand my ground 
 Stand my ground 
 I won't give in (I won't give in) 
 I won't give up (I won't give up) 
 No more denying (Ah-hhhh) 
 I've gotta face it 
 Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I don't make it, someone else will 
 Stand my ground 
 I won't give in 
 No more denying 
 I've gotta face it 
 Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I don't make it, someone else will 
 Stand my groundKiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby, you the best 
 I got my red dress on tonight 
 Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight 
 Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style 
 High heels off, I'm feelin' alive 
 Oh my God, I feel it in the air 
 Telephone wires above 
 Are sizzlin' like a snare 
 Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere 
 Nothin' scares me anymore 
 (One, two, three, four) 
 Kiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby, you the best 
 I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness 
 Got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 I'm feelin' electric tonight 
 Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99 
 Got my bad baby by my heavenly side 
 I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight 
 Oh my God, I feel it in the air 
 Telephone wires above 
 Are sizzlin' like a snare 
 Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere 
 Nothin' scares me anymore 
 (One, two, three, four) 
 Kiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby, you the best 
 I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness 
 Got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Think I'll miss you forever 
 Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky 
 Later's better than never 
 Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive 
 I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness 
 Got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Kiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby, you the best 
 I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
 Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness 
 Got that summertime, summertime sadnessIt burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear 
 You were never free and you never realized 
 And love is a word you've never heard 
 Your heart ain't cold 'cause it burns, a desire to leave the mire 
 Take your breath till nothing's left 
 Scars of life upon your chest 
 And I know wherever it goes 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin' love 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Yeah, we run, runnin' in the dark 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone, yeah, we outta here 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin' love 
 And we long for a heavenly heart 
 I'mma break these chains, ran through the rain 
 Never looked back, never quit, work through the pain 
 This blood in my veins run cold when I think 
 It'll never be the same but I never lose hope 
 This is my time now, no time for tears, to celebrate 
 Put it in the air right now, never back down 
 You can never wear my crown 'cause it weighs too much 
 And I crush every motherfuckin' thing I touch 
 This is love, I've never loved so much 
 Get involved, make the world stand up 
 Give my life before I ever give up 
 "Name in lights", you lost all my trust 
 Now it's time to face all of us 
 Get in line 'cause they're callin' us 
 And it feels so marvelous 
 Just take my hand and run 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin' love 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Yeah, we run, runnin' in the dark 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone, yeah, we outta here 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin' love 
 And we long for a heavenly heart 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here 
 Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head 
 Too late, we gone, yeah, we outta hereWake up in the dead of night 
 Dogs are turning wild 
 Run into what's wrong each time 
 Fail to get it right 
 Fighting off this heavy heart 
 Keeping your head high 
 Oh won't you please forget? 
 Won't you please forget? 
 These are the dog days 
 These are the dog days 
 Leading our hearts astray 
 These are the dog days

 1, 2, 3, 4 
 What are you waiting for? 
 These are the dog days 
 These are the dog days 
 Awakened by the dreams at night 
 Chills run down your spine 
 The brightest star in summer skies 
 Brings madness to our minds 
 Fighting off the darkest thoughts 
 Fighting to survive 
 Oh won't you please forget? 
 Won't you please forget? 
 These are the dog days

 Leading our hearts astray

 What are you waiting for? 
 These are the dog days 
 These are the dog days 
 (These are the dog days) 
 Embracing the highs to fight the lows 
 Running down the path that I think I need to go 
 When you think you've won, you're still losing after all 
 These are the dog days 
 These are the dog days 
 1, 2, 3, 4

 These are the dog daysLost in the darkness, 
 Hoping for a sign. 
 Instead there is only silence, 
 Can't you hear my screams? 
 Never stop hoping, 
 Need to know where you are. 
 But one thing is for sure, 
 You're always in my heart. 
 I'll find you somewhere, 
 I'll keep on trying until my dying day. 
 I just need to know whatever has happened, 
 The truth will free my soul. 
 Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home. 
 I want to embrace you and never let you go. 
 Almost hope you're in heaven so no one can hurt your soul. 
 Living in agony 'cause I just do not know where you are. 
 I'll find you somewhere, 
 I'll keep on trying until my dying day. 
 I just need to know whatever has happened, 
 The truth will free my soul. 
 Wherever you are, 
 I won't stop searching. 
 Whatever it takes, 
 I need to know. 
 I'll find you somewhere, 
 I'll keep on trying until my dying day. 
 I just need to know whatever has happened, 
 The truth will free my soul.Armies have conquered 
 And fallen in the end 
 Kingdoms have risen 
 Then buried by sand 
 The Earth is our mother 
 She gives and she takes 
 She puts us to sleep 
 In her light we'll awake 
 We'll all be forgotten 
 There's no endless fame 
 But everything we do 
 It's never in vain 
 We're part of a story, part of a tale 
 We're all on this journey 
 No one is to stay 
 Where ever it's going? 
 What is the way? 
 Forests and deserts 
 Rivers, blue seas 
 Mountains and valleys 
 Nothing here stays 
 While we think we witness 
 We are part of the scene 
 This never-ending story 
 Where will it lead to? 
 The earth is our mother 
 She gives and she takes 
 But she's also a part 
 A part of the tale 
 We're part of a story, part of a tale 
 We're all on this journey 
 No one's to stay 
 Oh where is it going? 
 What is the way? 
 We're part of a story, part of a tale 
 Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane 
 No one remembers how it began 
 We're part of a story, part of a tale 
 We're all on this journey 
 No one's to stay 
 Oh where is it going? 
 What is the way? 
 We're part of a story, part of a tale 
 Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane 
 No one remembers how it beganYou shout it out 
 But I can't hear a word you say 
 Talking loud 
 Not saying much 
 Criticize 
 But all your bullets ricochet 
 Shoot me down 
 But I get up 
 I'm bulletproof 
 Nothing to lose 
 Fire away, fire away 
 Ricochet 
 You take your aim 
 Fire away, fire away 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 Cut me down 
 But it's you who'll have further to fall 
 Ghost town 
 Haunted love 
 Raise your voice 
 Sticks and stones may break my bones 
 Talking loud 
 Not saying much 
 I'm bulletproof 
 Nothing to lose 
 Fire away, fire away 
 Ricochet 
 You take your aim 
 Fire away, fire away 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 I am titanium 
 I am titanium 
 Stone heart 
 Machine gun 
 Firing at the ones who run 
 Stone heart 
 Loves bulletproof glass 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 You shoot me down 
 But I won't fall 
 I am titanium 
 I am titaniumI'm dying to catch my breath 
 Oh why don't I ever learn? 
 I've lost all my trust, 
 Though I've surely tried to turn it around 
 Can you still see the heart of me? 
 All my agony fades away 
 When you hold me in your embrace 
 Don't tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Give me something I can believe 
 Don't tear me down 
 You've opened the door now, don't let it close 
 I'm here on the edge again 
 I wish I could let it go 
 I know that I'm only one step away 
 From turning it around 
 Can you still see the heart of me? 
 All my agony fades away 
 When you hold me in your embrace 
 Don't tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Give me something I can believe 
 Don't tear it down, what's left of me 
 Make my heart a better place 
 I tried many times but nothing was real 
 Make it fade away, don't break me down 
 I want to believe that this is for real 
 Save me from my fear 
 Don't tear me down 
 Don't tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Don't tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Give me something I can believe 
 Don't tear it down, what's left of me 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Make my heart a better placeWould you mind if I hurt you? 
 Understand that I need to 
 Wish that I had other choices 
 Than to harm the one I love 
 What have you done now? 
 I know I better stop tryin' 
 You know that there's no denyin' 
 I won't show mercy on you now 
 I know I should stop believin' 
 I know that there's no retrievin' 
 It's over now, what have you done? 
 What have you done now? 
 I have been waitin' for someone like you 
 But now you are slippin' away, oh 
 (What have you done now?) 
 Why, why does fate make us suffer? 
 There's a curse between us, between me and you 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done now? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done? 
 What have you done now? 
 Would you mind if I killed you? 
 Would you mind if I tried to? 
 'Cause you have turned into my worst enemy 
 You carry hate that I don't feel 
 It's over now, what have you done? 
 What have you done now? 
 I have been waitin' for someone like you 
 But now you are slippin' away, oh 
 (What have you done now?) 
 Why, why does fate make us suffer? 
 There's a curse between us, between me and you

 I will not fall, won't let it go 
 We will be free when it ends

 Why, why does fate make us suffer? 
 There's a curse between us, between me and youYour call is coming 
 I'm dreaming away 
 For what lies hidden 
 It needs to be found 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found 
 They will lead us to tomorrow 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 Voices forgotten 
 I hear them close by 
 Ghosts from the past I can see through their eyes 
 Are these the ancestors leaving me signs? 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found 
 They will lead us to tomorrow 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 The sounds, they are all around 
 Forces start moving out 
 Taking sides, though there's so much 
 That I need to know 
 And soon it will be shown 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found 
 They will lead us to tomorrow 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found, they will lead us to tomorrow 
 When the ghosts are found, they will lead us to tomorrow 
 If we could restart how it was before tomorrowLeft in the darkness 
 Here on your own 
 Woke up a memory 
 Feeding the pain 
 You cannot deny it 
 There's nothing to say 
 It's all that you need to fire away 
 Oh damn, the war is coming 
 Oh damn, you feel you want it 
 Oh damn, just bring it on today 
 You can't live without the fire 
 It's the heat that makes you strong 
 'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way 
 You can't hide what lies inside you 
 It's the only thing you know 
 You'll embrace it and never walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Raised in this madness 
 You're on your own 
 It makes you fearless 
 Nothing to lose 
 Dreams are a drug here 
 They get in your way 
 That's what what you need to fight day by day. 
 Oh damn, the war is coming 
 Oh damn, you feel you want it 
 Oh damn, just bring it on today 
 You can't live without the fire 
 It's the heat that makes you strong 
 'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way 
 You can't hide what lies inside you 
 It's the only thing you know 
 You'll embrace it and never walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 ( 
 Spoken by Mother Maiden 
 ) 
 You need not fear us, 
 Unless you are a Darkheart, 
 A vile one who preys on the innocent. 
 I promise: 
 You can't hide forever from the empty darkness, 
 For we will hunt you down like the animals you are, 
 And pull you into the very bowels of Hell! 
 Oh damn, the war is coming 
 Oh damn, you feel you want it 
 Oh damn, just bring it on today 
 You can't live without the fire 
 It's the heat that makes you strong 
 'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way 
 You can't hide what lies inside you 
 It's the only thing you know 
 You'll embrace it and never walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk away 
 Don't walk awayWell you only need the light when it's burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
 Only hate the road when you're missin' home 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 And you let her go 
 Staring at the bottom of your glass 
 Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last 
 But dreams come slow and they go so fast 
 You see her when you close your eyes 
 Maybe one day you'll understand why 
 Everything you touch surely dies 
 But you only need the light when it's burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
 Only hate the road when you're missin' home 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Staring at the ceiling in the dark 
 Same old empty feeling in your heart 
 'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast 
 Well you see her when you fall asleep 
 But never to touch and never to keep 
 'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep 
 Well you only need the light when it's burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
 Only hate the road when you're missin' home 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 And you let her go 
 And you let her go 
 Well you let her go 
 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
 Only hate the road when you're missin' home 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low 
 Only hate the road when you're missin' home 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 And you let her goI've got to try it's not over yet 
 No signals of life have you left 
 My heart is bleeding just for you 
 Bleeds for only 
 And it hurts to know the truth 
 Are you looking for savior 
 Chasing a dream 
 Love turned to hate 
 Now I'm crossing the border 
 Sealing our fate 
 But I'm not afraid 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 I'm telling you, you will like it, I know 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, it's the first time 
 Only you can set it free 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, come break away with me 
 This second chance I know won't last 
 But's OK, got no regrets 
 And I, I feel the end near, I'm no fool 
 Getting closer 
 But I'm doing what I should 
 I've been drowning in sorrow 
 Chasing tomorrow, running away 
 Now you're crossing the borders 
 Sealing tomorrow but you're not afraid 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 I'm telling you, you will like it, I know 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, it's the first time 
 Only you can set it free 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, come break away with me 
 I've been drowning in sorrow 
 Chasing tomorrow, running away 
 Now you're crossing the borders 
 Sealing tomorrow but you're not afraid 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 I'm telling you, you will like it 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 I'm telling you, you will like it, I know. Wohoho! 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, it's the first time 
 Only you can set it free 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad, come break away with me"O deus eicie" 
 Mortatis animus solum est. 
 Letalis animus concidamus unis. 
 Osstendo malum, osstendo lux. 
 Anima mortatis eternum est. 
 Anima irrata belli somnium. 
 Anima quiesa evitae somnium. 
 Anima mortatis eternum sunt. 
 Mortatis animus solum est. 
 Letalis animus concidamus unis. 
 Osstendo malum.In this world you tried 
 Not leaving me alone behind 
 There's no other way 
 I prayed to the gods let him stay 
 The memories ease the pain inside 
 Now I know why 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 In silent moments 
 Imagine you'd be here 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 Your silent whispers, silent tears 
 Made me promise I'd try 
 To find my way back in this life 
 I hope there is a way 
 To give me a sign you're okay 
 Reminds me again it's worth it all 
 So I can go home 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 In silent moments 
 Imagine you'd be here 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 Your silent whispers, silent tears 
 Together in all these memories 
 I see your smile 
 All the memories I hold dear 
 Darling, you know I'll love you 
 'Til the end of time 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 In silent moments 
 Imagine you'd be here 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 Your silent whispers, silent tears 
 All of my memories..."I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country, of our empire, of our allies, and, above all, of the cause of Freedom." 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Redeem us from our solemn hour. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Insanity is all around us. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! 
 In my darkest hours I could not foresee, 
 That the tide could turn so fast to this degree. 
 Can't believe my eyes, how can you be so blind? 
 Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside? 
 Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned. 
 So in the end now what have we gained? 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Redeem us from our solemn hour. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Insanity is all around us. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Is this what we deserve, 
 Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony? 
 Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain? 
 Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow? 
 If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside 
 it will find its way somehow, somewhere in time 
 Will we remember all of the suffering? 'Cause if we fail it will be in vain. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Redeem us from our solemn hour. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Insanity is all around us. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Is this what we deserve, 
 Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony? 
 "A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders. The Germans, by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armoured tanks, have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of their armoured vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the first day or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track." 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Redeem us from our solemn hour. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Insanity is all around us. 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Is this what we deserve, 
 Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony? 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Redeem us from our solemn hour. (Our solemn hour!) 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Insanity is all around us. (All around us!) 
 Sanctus Espiritus! Is this what we deserve, 
 Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?Winter has come for me, can't carry on. 
 The chains to my life are strong, but soon they'll be gone. 
 I'll spread my wings one more time. 
 Is it a dream? 
 All the ones I've loved calling out my name. 
 The sun warms my face. 
 All the days of my life, I see them passing me by. 
 In my heart I know, I can let go. 
 In the end I will find some peace inside. 
 New wings are growing tonight. 
 Is it a dream? 
 All the ones I've loved calling out my name. 
 The sun warms my face. 
 All the days of my life, I see them passing me by. 
 As I am soaring I'm one with the wind. 
 I am longing to see you again, it's been so long. 
 We will be together again. 
 Is it a dream? 
 All the ones I've loved calling out my name. 
 The sun warms my face. 
 All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
