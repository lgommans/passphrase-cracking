I need an easy friend 
 I do with an ear to lend 
 I do think you fit this shoe 
 I do, but you have a clue 
 I'll take advantage while 
 You hang me out to dry 
 But I can't see you every night, free 
 I do 
 I'm standing in your line 
 I do hope you have the time 
 I do pick a number two 
 I do keep a date with you 
 I'll take advantage while 
 You hang me out to dry 
 But I can't see you every night, free 
 I need an easy friend 
 I do with an ear to lend 
 I do think you fit this shoe

 What's the season in a right if you can't have anything? 
 What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means everything? 
 What's the meaning in a crime? It's a fan if anything 
 Where's the leaning in a line? It's a crime, it's a crime 
 How a culture comes again? It was all here yesterday 
 And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyways 
 You're only hear to talk to friend nothing new is every day 
 You could shit upon the stage they'll be fans 
 They'll be fans 
 They'll be fans 
 They'll be fans 
 All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly 
 Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally 
 Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays 
 An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways. 
 All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly 
 Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally 
 Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays 
 An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways.

 Hey ...This song is for lovers out there 
 And the little light in the trees 
 And all the flowers have gingivitis 
 And the birds fly happily 
 We'll be together once again my love 
 I need you back, oh baby baby 
 I can't explain just why we lost it from the start 
 Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart... 
 I can feel it, I can hold it 
 I can bend it I can shape it, I can mold it 
 I can cut it, I can taste it 
 I can spank it, beat it, masturbate it 
 I been looking for day glo 
 Always hearing the same ol' 
 Say you want to be faithful 
 I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever couldHold me, there's too much tension 
 Degrade me, I'm fucking hungry 
 Help me, I'm fucking cornered 
 Grade me, you make it more 
 Lightning fucking around in my head 
 Fierce, dangerous, pathetic, fucked up 
 People freaking every day 
 White lights inside 
 What do you want 
 Cold naked man, picked off his scabs and 
 Fed them to the pigeons 
 Help him, he's fucking cornered 
 Grade him it might be fun 
 Lightning fucking around in my head 
 Fierce, dangerous, pathetic, fucked up 
 People freaking every day

 People freaking every day 
 White lights inside

 Help me, I'm fucking hungry 
 Help me, I'm fucking up 
 Hold me, some fucking helpRunny nose and runny yolk 
 Even if you have a cold still 
 You can cough on me again 
 I still haven't had my fulfill 
 In the someday what's that sound? 
 Broken heart and broken bones 
 Think of how a castrated horse feels 
 One more quirky cliche'd phrase 
 You're the one I wanna refill 
 In the someday what's that sound?

 Those years in his bonet 
 A phrase from his pocket 
 And chains of a knowing 
 Life long dream

 If I may 
 And if I might 
 Wake me up 
 And see me 
 And if I do 
 And if I lie 
 Find me out 
 At sea 
 And if I may 
 Cold as ice 
 I might have to 
 See me 
 Dream 
 The rays in his socket 
 A phrase from this moment 
 The chase on his socket I will need 
 Dream 
 Do re mi 
 Wish me good 
 Wish made light 
 Find me out 
 At sea 
 He's under a wave 
 Just be quiet 
 Follow pain 
 And grieving 
 Yell 'oh well' 
 And if I sigh 
 Seek me out 
 Teeming 
 If I may 
 If I might 
 Golden gun

 And praise in his pocket 
 Rays from his women 
 Chains from his knowing

 Gone!Goodbye my friend it's hard to die 
 When all the birds are singing in the sky 
 And all the birds are everywhere 
 Pretty girls are everywhere 
 Think of me and I'll be there 
 Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me. 
 I was the black sheep of the family. 
 And I don't know how this works 
 I had bought thee turds, 
 With my B-B gun I would kill birds 
 We had joy. We had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the hills that we climb 
 Were just seasons out of time. 
 All our lives, we had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the stars that we reached 
 Were just starfish on the beach 
 Goodbye Michelle my little one 
 (The following two lines were murmured during the box-set video, and were visibly forgotten, as evidenced by Kurt's chuckle.) 
 You gave me love and helped me find the sun 
 And every time that I was down 
 All my tears are salty 
 I think now I was start to weep 
 We had joy. We had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the hills that we climb 
 Were just seasons out of time. 
 We had joy. We had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the stars that we reached 
 Were just starfish on the beach 
 We had joy. We had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the hills that we climb 
 Were just seasons out of time. 
 We had joy. We had fun. 
 We had seasons in the sun, 
 But the stars that we reached 
 Were just starfish on the beachWe passed upon the stair 
 We spoke of was and when 
 Although I wasn't there 
 He said I was his friend 
 Which came as a surprise 
 I spoke into his eyes 
 I thought you died alone 
 A long long time ago 
 Oh no, not me 
 We never lost control 
 You're face, to face 
 With the man who sold the world 
 I laughed and shook his hand 
 And made my way back home 
 I searched for form and land 
 For years and years I roamed 
 I gazed a gazely stare 
 We walked a million hills 
 I must have died alone 
 A long long time ago 
 Who knows, not me 
 I never lost control 
 You're face, to face 
 With the man who sold the world 
 Who knows, not me 
 We never lost control 
 You're face, to face 
 With the man who sold the worldTo hope is admittance 
 Feed before beginning 
 Double-sided cynics 
 Reflected images 
 Don't be so selfish 
 Leaving the image 
 Follow it far 
 To find where you are 
 You haven't grown 
 Go on alone 
 Never finished his sentence 
 Remained in seclusion 
 For the next few days 
 Family is circuling 
 He having moved up 
 All the styles of heresy 
 Finally he appeared unexpectedly 
 Looking for companyI could, I can shit anywhere 
 And I promised a girl I would shit on the stage 
 Oh that sound and falling no 
 I chose to shit anywhere 
 And I promise to shit on your head 
 (Cannot make out next 3 lines) 
 God I shit I'll shit anywhere 
 And I go when I chose to 
 Trained on your face 
 Right and god oh god I'll wipe my helmet 
 Want my safe 
 I'm new wave 
 I'm new wave 
 I'm new wave 
 Ah I'm new wave 
 I'm new wave

 I'm old school 
 I'm old school 
 I'm new wave and not straight

 Use just once and destroy 
 Invasion of our piracy 
 Afterbirth of a nation 
 Starve without your skeleton key 
 I love you for what I am not 
 I do not want what I have got 
 A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns 
 Speak at once while taking turns 
 What is what I need 
 What is wrong with me 
 What is what I need 
 This had nothing to do with what you think 
 If you ever think at all 
 Bi-polar opposites attract 
 All of a sudden my water broke 
 I love you for what I am not 
 I do not want what I have got 
 A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns 
 Second-rate third degree burns

 Pee pee pressed against my lips

 Tell me where did you sleep, last night 
 In the pines, in the pines 
 Where the sun don't ever shine 
 I would shiver the whole, night through 
 My girl, my girl, where will you go 
 I'm goin' where the cold, wind blows 
 In the pines, in the pines 
 Where the sun don't ever shine 
 I would shiver the whole, night through 
 Her husband, was a hard working man 
 Just about a mile, from here 
 His head, was found, in a drivin' wheel 
 But his body never was found 
 My girl, my girl, don't lie to me 
 Tell me where did you sleep last night 
 In the pines, in the pines 
 Where the sun don't ever shine 
 I would shiver the whole, night through 
 My girl, my girl, where will you go 
 I'm going where the cold, wind blows 
 In the pines, in the pines

 Portray sincerity, act out of loyalty 
 Defend every country, wish away pain 
 Hand out lobotomies to save little families 
 Surrealistic fantasy bland, boring, plain. 
 Hold me down in restitution 
 Living out your date with fusion. 
 Is the whole thing shun in bastard? 
 Don't feel guilty masturbating. 
 Somebody said that they're not much like I am 
 I know I can 
 Make enough of the words as you go along 
 I sink then some. 
 Slippery pessimist, hypocrite master 
 Conservative Communist, apocalyptic bastard 
 Thank you, dear God, for putting me on this Earth 
 I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst. 
 Hold me down in restitution 
 Living out your date with fusion. 
 Is the whole fleece shun in bastard? 
 Don't feel guilty masturbating. 
 Somebody said that they're not much like I am 
 I know I can 
 Make enough of the words as you go along 
 I sing then some.She should have stayed away from friends

 My momma used to dance for the money they'd throw 
 Poppa would do whatever he could 
 Preach a little gospel 
 Sell a couple bottles of doctor good 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 We'd hear it from the people of the town 
 They'd call us 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 But every night all the men would come around 
 And lay their money down 
 Picked up a boy just south of Mobile 
 Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal 
 I was sixteen he was twenty one 
 Rode with us to Memphis 
 And poppa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 We'd hear it from the people of the town 
 They'd call us 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 But every night all the men would come around 
 And lay their money down

 Preach a little gospel 
 Sell a couple bottles of doctor good 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 We'd hear it from the people of the town 
 They'd call us 
 Gypsies tramps and thieves 
 But every night all the men would come around 
 And lay their money down 
 Blahblahblahblah... 
 Fuck it 
 Fuck it allOne more day to complete my service 
 One more high to decay my nervous 
 Wondering how I'm gonna find a way 
 It's over 
 One more day to complete my service 
 One more time here to fade my servant 
 One more day if I find a way 
 Over 
 She seemed to read minds 
 And I know a later time 
 We could make it with you 
 Leave the soul 
 Old age 
 One more day to complain my servant 
 One more doubt here to find a servant 
 One more time here if I find a way 
 It's over 
 Wondering how I'm here date my cover 
 One more doubt here to save my never 
 Wondering how I'm gonna find a way 
 It's over 
 She seemed to read minds 
 And I know a later time 
 We could make it with you 
 Leave the soul 
 Old age 
 Just you need 
 And read 
 You're freak 
 Hmmmmm 
 And knew 
 You read 
 You flew 
 Hmmmmm 
 One more day to concrete my circuit 
 One more high here to find my nervous 
 Someday I'm gonna find a way 
 It's over 
 One more doubt here to claim my supper 
 I can have anything you want to 
 One more day if I find a way 
 It's over 
 She seemed to read minds 
 And I know we were out of time 
 Breathe the way here with you 
 Dream the same on the dew 
 Breathe the same on her 
 Take a moan on a man 
 Breathe the shame on you 
 Breathe the lie 
 Old ageFill me in on your new vision 
 Wake me up with indecision 
 Help me trust your might and wisdom 
 Yes I eat cow, I am not proud 
 Show me how you question, question 
 Lead the way to my temptations 
 Take my hand and keep it clean 
 Yes I eat cow, I am not proud 
 Easy in an easychair? 
 Poop as hard as rock 
 I don't like you anyway 
 Seal it in a box 
 I'm new 
 Now you 
 Fill me in on your new vision 
 Wake me up with indecision 
 Help me trust your might and wisdom

 AhHey fellas, have you heard the news? 
 You know that Annie's back in town? 
 It won't take long, just watch and see 
 All the fellas lay their money down 
 Her style is new, but the face the same 
 As it was so long ago 
 But from her eyes, a different smile 
 Like that of one who knows 
 Well, it's been ten years and maybe more 
 Since I first set eyes on you 
 The best years of my life gone by 
 Here I am alone and blue 
 Some people cry and some people die 
 By the wicked ways of love 
 But I'll just keep on rollin' along 
 With the grace of the Lord above 
 People talkin' all around 
 'Bout the way you left me flat 
 I don't care what the people say 
 I know where their jive is at 
 One thing I do have on my mind 
 If you can clarify, please do 
 It's the way you call me another guy's name 
 When I try to make love to you 
 I try to make love, but it ain't no use 
 Give it to me, give it 
 Work so hard, I can't unwind 
 Get some money saved 
 Abuse my love a thousand times 
 However hard I tried 
 Heartbreaker, your time has come 
 Can't take your evil ways 
 Go away, heartbreaker 
 Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heart!My baby taught me how to be 
 My baby taught me how to fight 
 My baby taught me how to die 
 Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol! 
 My baby taught me how to smoke 
 My baby taught me how to breathe 
 My baby taught me how to hide 
 My baby taught me how to leave 
 Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol! 
 My baby taught me how to choke 
 My baby taught me how to eat

 She is moving through 
 Can we show our faces now? 
 I'm not interesting 
 She's not turning green 
 Shameful as it seems 
 Can we show our faces now? 
 Endless climb

 Why am I sure?Oh, itchy flakes, it isn't through me 
 Till the jaw's in flames, it's entertaining 
 True, the fungus mold is my attraction 
 Oh, it's only a disinfection 
 Only hurts when I, it hurts when I pee 
 Only hurts when I, it hurts when I sleep 
 I vomit cum and diarrhea on the tiled floor like oatmeal pizza 
 Fill my toilet bowl of a cloudy puss 
 I feel my blood becoming chowder rust 
 Only hurts a night, it hurts when I pee 
 Only hurts a night, until I sleep 
 Roll into my bed which does consist of lice bugs and fleas and 
 And yellow mucus 
 Stained dirt, Vaseline, toe jam and boogers 
 Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared slusdgeWe come from the land of the ice and snow 
 From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow 
 Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands 
 To fight the horde and sing and cry 
 Valhalla, I am coming 
 On we sweep with the threshing oar 
 Our only goal will be the western shore 
 We come from the land of the ice and snow 
 From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow 
 How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore 
 Of how we calmed the tides of war 
 We are your overlords 
 On we sweep with the threshing oar 
 Our only goal will be the western shore 
 So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins 
 For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing"Fight tuberculosis, folks" 
 Christmas Eve, an old junkie selling Christmas seals 
 On North Park Street 
 The "Priest" they called him 
 "Fight tuberculosis, folks" 
 People hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall 
 It was getting late and no money to score 
 He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife 
 Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight 
 Boy got out with a suitcase 
 Thin kid in prep school clothes 
 Familiar face, the Priest told himself 
 Watching from the doorway. 
 "Reminds me of something a long time ago" 
 The boy, there, with his overcoat 
 Unbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare 
 The cab drove away and turned the corner 
 The boy went inside a building 
 "Hmm, yes, maybe," the suitcase was there in the doorway 
 The boy nowhere in sight 
 Gone to get the keys, most likely, have to move fast 
 He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner 
 Made it, glanced down at the case 
 It didn't look like the case the boy had or any boy would have 
 The Priest couldn't put his finger on what was so old about the case 
 Old and dirty, poor quality leather and heavy 
 Better see what's inside 
 He turned into Lincoln Park 
 Found an empty place and opened the case 
 Two severed human legs that belonged to a young man 
 With dark skin, shiny black leg hairs 
 Glittered in the dim streetlight 
 The legs had been forced into the case 
 And he had to use his knee on the back of the case to shove them out 
 "Legs, yet," he said and walked quickly away with the case. 
 Might bring a few dollars to score 
 The buyer sniffed suspiciously 
 "Kind of a funny smell about it" 
 "It's just Mexican leather" 
 "Well, some joker didn't cure it" 
 The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor 
 "Not even right sure he killed it, whatever it is 
 Three is the best I can do and it hurts 
 But since this is Christmas and you're the Priest" 
 He slipped three bills under the table into the Priest's dirty hand 
 The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedy and furtive 
 Three cents didn't buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel 
 Say, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back 
 Unless I paid him the three cents I owe him 
 Yeah, isn't that a fruit for ya, blow your stack about three lousy cents 
 The doctor was not pleased to see him 
 "Now, what do you want? I told you!" 
 The Priest laid three bills on the table 
 The doctor put the money in his pocket and started to scream 
 "I've had trouble! People have been around! 
 I may lose my license!" 
 The Priest just sat there 
 Eyes, old and heavy with years of junk, on the doctor's face 
 "I can't write you a prescription" 
 The doctor jerked open a drawer 
 And slid an ampule across the table 
 "That's all I have in the office!" The doctor stood up 
 "Take it and get out!" he screamed, hysterical 
 The Priest's expression did not change 
 The doctor added in quieter tones 
 "After all, I'm a professional man 
 And I shouldn't be bothered by people like you" 
 "Is that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? 
 Couldn't you lend me a nickel?" 
 "Get out, get out, I'll call the police I tell you" 
 "All right, doctor, I'm going" 
 Of course it was cold and far walk to rooming house 
 A shabby street, room on the top floor 
 "These stairs," coughed the Priest 
 There pulling himself up along the bannister 
 He went into the bathroom 
 Yellow wall panels, toilet dripping 
 And got his works from under the washbasin 
 Wrapped in brown paper, back to his room 
 Get every drop in the dropper 
 He rolled up his sleeve 
 Then he heard a groan from next door 
 Room 18, the Mexican kid lived there 
 The Priest had passed him on the stairs 
 And saw the kid was hooked 
 But he never spoke because he didn't want any juvenile connections 
 Bad news in any language 
 The Priest had had enough bad news in his life 
 He heard the groan again, a groan he could feel 
 No mistaking that groan and what it meant 
 "Maybe he had an accident or something. 
 In any case, I can't enjoy my priestly medications 
 With that sound coming through the wall" 
 Thin walls you understand 
 The Priest put down his dropper 
 Cold hall and knocked on the door of Room 18 
 "Quien es?" 
 "It's the Priest, kid, I live next door" 
 He could hear someone hobbling across the floor 
 A bolt slid, the boy stood there in his underwear shorts 
 Eyes black with pain, he started to fall 
 The Priest helped him over to the bed 
 "What's wrong, son?" 
 "It's my legs, señor, cramps 
 And now I am without medicine" 
 The Priest could see the cramps 
 Like knots of wood there in the young legs 
 Dark shiny black leg hairs 
 "A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race 
 It was then that the cramps started" 
 And now he has the leg cramps back 
 With compound junk interest 
 The old Priest stood there, feeling the boy groan 
 He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper 
 "It's just a quarter G, kid" 
 "I do not require much, señor" 
 The boy was sleeping when the Priest left Room 18 
 He went back to his room and sat down on the bed 
 Then it hit him like heavy silent snow 
 All the gray junk yesterdays 
 He sat there, received the immaculate fix 
 And since he was himself a priest 
 There was no need to call one(Music and Lyrics: Kurt Cobain) 
 I wasn't seeking him for a father 
 Not only magnets but I could pry bar his shaft 
 Gluing my manhood to ze manhole (*said in a smarmy French accent) 
 Like Peppy Lepew would say 
 Hey-hey-hey, then we clash! 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily 
 Shouldn't've asked buddy 
 Shrinking in flesh if the wind blows just right 
 Jacking themselves off polyester 
 Highwater jumpsuits and uh, right, 
 Hey, when am I getting it back? 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed

 Don't touch the balls 
 I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking, hey! 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily 
 If you're worried, it's gaining monthly 
 Fiberglass insulation disguised as cotton candy 
 Smiling down Steve "El Rancho" Ovule (sp?) 
 Feeding a cow hamburger raw 
 Bill has brought me a Tiki idol 
 Philly Slim reminds me of someone 
 I'm sick of playing Father Love Bone 
 Tony and Tennille, Sonny Bono, Charo 
 Had a nice set of lungs! 
 I got my philly spayed 
 I got a little tail 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 I got my diddily spayed 
 Hard 
 I gotta be around pussy 
 Don't let me fall 
 I got a, hey-hey 
 Well you can't live

 A desire, is what's for you 
 Is it real? a lulliby? 
 Face to face, with an unamed mouth 
 Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! 
 Feel the spirit form, in his eyes was loving for 
 And his lion's were raging high, hunts himself and fears his ripe 
 Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! 
 Hey!I'll start this off, without any words 
 I got so high, I scratched 'till I bled 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 The finest day, that I've ever had 
 Was when I learned, to cry on command 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plain 
 My mother died, every night 
 It's safe to say, don't quote me on that 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 The black sheep got, blackmailed again 
 Forgot to put, on the zip code 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plain 
 Somewhere I have heard this before 
 In a dream my memory has stored 
 As a defense I'm neutered and spayed 
 What the hell am I trying to say 
 It is now time, to make it unclear 
 To write off lines, that don't make sense 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 And one more special, message to go 
 And then I'm done, then I can go home 
 Love myself, better than you 
 I know it's wrong, so what should I do 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plain, I can't complain 
 I'm on a plainJesus, don't want me for a sunbeam

 You're really nowhere 
 So wasteful 
 So foolish 
 Poppycock! 
 Who said don't look back? 
 Don't believe 'em 
 Go for that crazy sounding restaurant 
 'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you 
 Don't you let 'em do it 
 You know what I'm talking about? 
 You hear me talking? 
 You hear me talking?

 Nah! 
 Take a step out of the country 
 And you turn around 
 Take a look at where you are 
 It is amazing 
 Take a good look 
 You're no big deal 
 You're so petty 
 It's a laugh 
 Oh 
 Take a step outside the planet 
 Turn around and around 
 Take a look at where you are

 That legendary divorce is such a bore 
 As my bones grew they did hurt 
 They hurt really bad 
 I tried hard to have a father 
 But instead I had a Dad

 Don't hate you anymore 
 There is nothing I could say 
 That I haven't thought before

 If I had to touch feelings 
 I would lose my soul

 Sprinkled with emotion 
 Vented at your birth 
 I can't see, the end of me 
 My whole expanse, I cannot see 
 I formulate infinity 
 Stored deep inside me

 I wanna be aloneMany a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau 
 Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know 
 Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand 
 To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands 
 There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop 
 And an illustrated book about birds 
 You see a lot up there but don't be scared 
 Who needs action when you got words? 
 When you've finished with the mop then you can stop 
 And look at what you've done 
 The plateau's clean no dirt to be seen 
 And the work, it was fun 
 There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop 
 And an illustrated book about birds 
 You see a lot up there but don't be scared 
 Who needs action when you got words? 
 Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau 
 Some say it was in Greenland, and some say Mexico 
 Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood 
 But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they couldShe says she's changed

 ==Some versions of this song might be different, because it's not an official album track.==If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew 
 If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose 
 If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave 
 If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe 
 Is there another reason for your stain? 
 Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain? 
 Here is another word that rhymes with shame

 Feeling so sedated, think I'll just give in 
 Taking medication till my stomach's full 
 Either side is sacred, growing in my home (Alt: Crawling in my hole) 
 Grass is greener, over here 
 You're the fog that keeps me clear 
 Reinventing, what would you do? 
 Take your time and I'll be true 
 You're the reason I feel pain 
 Feels so good to feel again 
 Neither side is sacred, no one wants to win 
 Feeling so sedated, but I can't give in 
 Even medication, till my stomach's full 
 Feeling so sedated, when I'm in my home 
 Grass is greener, over here 
 You're the fog that keeps me clear 
 Reinventing, what would you do? 
 Take your time and I'll be true

 Oh ...Like most babies smell like butter 
 His smell smelled like no other 
 He was born scentless and senseless 
 He was born a scentless apprentice 
 Away 
 Go away, go away 
 Every wet nurse refused to feed him 
 Electrolytes smell like semen 
 I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets 
 There are countless formulas for pressing flowers 
 Away 
 Go away, go away 
 I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms 
 Leaking the gas we'll make into perfume 
 You can't fire me because I quit! 
 Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit 
 Hey, go away 
 Go away, go away 
 Go away, go away 
 Go away, go awayYou're my favorite 
 Of my saviours 
 You're my favorite 
 Oh no 
 Yes you're my favorite 
 Of my favors 
 You're my razor 
 Oh no

 As intense as I thought 
 I need you around 
 To remind me when not to be calm (to remind me what not to become)

 Calm, calm, calmTruth covered in security 
 I can't let you smother me

 Trading off and taking turns 
 I don't regret a thing 
 I've got this friend, you see 
 Who makes me feel and I 
 Wanted more than I could steal 
 I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield 
 I'll go out of my way to prove I still 
 Smell her on you

 Afraid of never knowing fear 
 Experience anything you need

 Until it's fucking gone

 Wanted more than I could steal 
 I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield 
 I'll go out of my way to make you a deal 
 We'll make a pact to learn from who 
 Ever we want without any rules 
 And we'll share what's left of what we grew 
 They'll go out of their way

 Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend

 More chances to remember some things 
 So I couldn't have so much pressure on my

 The entire strip to be washed away 
 Cleansed as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol 
 Flowed through the strip and were set on fire.

 They don't go to heaven where the angels fly 
 They go to a lake of fire and fry 
 See 'em again till the fourth of July 
 I knew a lady who came from Duluth 
 Bit by a dog with a rabid tooth 
 She went to her grave just a little too soon 
 And flew away howlin' on the yellow moon 
 Where do bad folks go when they die? 
 They don't go to heaven where the angels fly 
 They go to a lake of fire and fry 
 See 'em again 'till the fourth of July 
 People cry and people moan 
 They look for a dry place to call their home 
 Try to find some place to rest their bones 
 While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own 
 Where do bad folks go when they die? 
 They don't go to heaven where the angels fly 
 They go to a lake of fire and fry 
 See 'em again 'till the fourth of JulyNow I found, 
 I'm alone 
 Now I found him here, 
 Screaming, 
 Hole in his head, 
 Death now comes with that... Nevermind 
 Now opponents said Nirvana, 
 Where there's nothing left to shoot. 
 People on MTV, 
 Wear flowers in their hair, 
 But for the sake of life and libery and, 
 Put off alone. 
 So don't follow him 
 You only felt the buckets of the raqueteer. 
 Hey Hey, 
 My mind, 
 Like a drug that finds you dreaming, 
 It takes it just because it can, 
 Like a gun that finds you sleeping, 
 Guilty just because it's said. 
 --Solo-- 
 That's a lot of plants, 
 That's a lot of trees, 
 Another promises, 
 Then will hurt you 
 And it's gone Kurt, 
 Long live the Queen, 
 Make shifts over, the buckets of the raqueteer. 
 Like the drug that finds you dreaming, 
 Like a gun that finds you sleeping, 
 Now the opponents said Nirvana. 
 Like the drug that finds you dreaming, 
 Like a killer, like a man, 
 Like a blow.When I looked you in the eye 
 I knew it was time for good-bye 
 You were the only one I had around 
 But you couldn't keep your feet on the ground 
 Run rabbit run 
 But what's that you're runnin' for 
 Run rabbit run 
 You ain't gonna run no more 
 Bye bye baby, bye bye bird! 
 Thought the cold sidewalk stones 
 Broke your little brittle bones 
 I know you were already dead 
 When the truck rolled over your head 
 Bye bye baby, bye bye bird!(Music and Lyrics: Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic)

 She pushed food through the door 
 And I crawl towards the crack of light 
 Sometimes I can't find my way 
 Newspapers spread around soaking all that they can 
 A cleaning is due again, a good hosing down 
 The lady whom I feel maternal love for 
 Can not look me in the eyes 
 But I see hers and they are blue 
 And they cock and twitch and masturbate 
 Ah

 Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails 
 I see others just like me, why do they not try to escape? 
 They bring out the older ones, they point in my way 
 They come with a flash of light and take my family away 
 And very later I have learned to 
 Accept some friends or ridicule 
 My whole existence is for your amusement 
 And that is why I'm here with you

 You haven't grown 
 Go on alone 
 Never finished his sentence 
 Remained in seclusion 
 For the next few days 
 The family circle noose 
 He had removed us 
 All the styles of heresy 
 Finally he appeared unexpectedly 
 Looking for companyI'm not like them, I can pretend 
 The sun is gone, I have a light 
 The day is done, I'm having fun 
 I think I'm dumb, maybe just happy 
 Think I'm just happy 
 Think I'm just happy 
 Think I'm just happy 
 My heart is broke, I have some glue 
 Help me inhale, mend it with you 
 We float around, hang out on clouds 
 Then we'll come down, have a hangover 
 Have a hangover 
 Have a hangover 
 Have a hangover 
 Skin the sun, fall asleep 
 Wish away, soul is cheap 
 Lesson learned, wish me luck 
 Soothe the burn, wake me up 
 I'm not like them, I can pretend 
 The sun is gone, but I have a light 
 The day is done, but I'm having fun 
 I think I'm dumb, maybe just happy 
 Think I'm just happy 
 Think I'm just happy 
 Think I'm just happy

 I think I'm dumb

 "I'm gonna open up myself a flea market 
 I'm gonna open up myself a flea market 
 And you're gonna wish that you did 
 And retire on the profits 
 First off, 
 I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars 
 And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21 
 Shop 
 And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf 
 Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated 
 Over the past 62 years 
 Then I'm going to get some plywood 
 I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two feet squares 
 Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into 
 Two by two feet squares, and then I'm going to put them onto the 
 Pieces of plywood 
 And then I'm going to go to the beach 
 I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some 
 Shells and driftwood 
 And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them 
 Onto the plywood and burlap 
 And sell 'em for lots of money 
 People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new 
 Toys and clothing 
 Then maybe someday I can get rid of that 
 Pissed-stained matress I've been sleeping on"
