I stay true to myself and my style, and I am always pushing myself to be aware of that and be original.
Keep working hard and you can get anything that you want.
I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and appealing.
I want people to remember me as a full on entertainer and a good person.
You have to love what you do to want to do it everyday.
I think it's important to take a break, you know, from the public eye for a while, and give people a chance to miss you. I want longevity. I don't want to get out there and run myself ragged and spread myself thin.
I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that. It is cool with me. It's wonderful to have sexy appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing.
If I don't think about it, it won't drive me crazy.
