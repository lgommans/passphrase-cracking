Irish,Activist
The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show. It is then we'll see the rising of the moon.
I was only a working-class boy from a Nationalist ghetto. But it is repression that creates the revolutionary spirit of freedom.
They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken.
They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show. It is then that we will see the rising of the moon.
Everyone, Republican or otherwise has their own particular part to play. No part is too great or too small, no one is too old or too young to do something.
We must see our present fight right through to the very end.
Our revenge will be the laughter of our children.
