I've realised that at the top of the mountain, there's another mountain.
I hope that I'm always struggling, really. You develop when you're struggling. When you're struggling, you get stronger.
Spider-Man has always been a symbol of goodness and doing the right thing and looking after your fellow man.
I don't believe anyone is ugly.
That's all I want, to keep losing myself.
My parents signed me up for classical guitar lessons, which made for two years of the most depressing Wednesday evenings.
I think too much. Being in my body is much more satisfying than being in my head.
I've gone through my whole life caring deeply what people think of me.

As an adolescent, Spider-Man was what got me through tough times in terms of being a skinny kid.
I feel incredibly awkward as a human being and incredibly teenaged still.
In secondary school I was floating - I wasn't passionate about anything. I did a little sport, but it was pretty joyless because the competitiveness was too much to bear.
I just think I've always been sensitive and had difficulty containing my feelings, and I've always searched for outlets for that, because otherwise those feelings come out in chaotic ways that aren't always great.
