English,Actor
I am quite happy that I can still walk down the street every day in a pair of jogging bottoms and my woolly hat, and no one knows who I am. That's nice.
When you are playing somebody who did exist, and there is good source material on them, whether it is a biography or archives or experts, you would be stupid not to delve into them. But there is a point in the process where you leave the books alone, and instead, you focus on the script and creating your version.
My first professional job was a Pete Bowker series for ITV called 'Monroe.' I played a Junior Cardiac Surgeon called Mullery.
I have absolutely no preference on TV or stage. Every job I take or that I audition for all comes down to the quality of the script.
Yes, both 'Being Human' and 'Outlander' are known for their loyal fanbases. The beauty of both of those jobs was that the characters were very removed from me. So I've been lucky to get off scot-free, without any strange encounters. The wigs, blood, and strange onscreen faces/voices - they haven't found their way into my day-to-day life. Yet.
My tips for any budding actors would be to go out and see as much as you possibly can. Find the people you want to work with and be ready to hopefully make them want to work with you.
