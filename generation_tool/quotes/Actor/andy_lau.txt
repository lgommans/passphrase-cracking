Chinese,Actor
Unfortunately, I don't have much free time.
Don't wait. If it's not right, move on.
You know, if I tell the press that I like long blonde hair, the next day there will be girls with long hair wigs outside waiting for me.
I start by using Chinese and many of the sounds of other languages are similar.
For example, in Malay, there are pronunciations that are similar to Chinese.
I am classified as an idol in Hong Kong and in Asia.
Actually, I look the same in real life as I do in the movies.
When you feel like this isn't your business, get out of the business.
If I was born again, I would be able to do any sport because I would have time to learn.
Now I do bowling, golf, and tennis. I want to be a good bowler.
Before you do anything, you need to know if it's right or wrong.
The more you do, the more experience you have and the next time it will be easier to choose the right thing.
I would like to do some musicals.
There are many kinds of movies in Hong Kong. Some are commercial and others are more artistic.
I became producer so that I could work with persons like him and to rock the world of Hong Kong Cinema a bit.
Wong Kar Wai is a very intense character, very personable, and I believe in general he does not like and he would not want his actors to show their true looks and their true personality on screen.
