American,Actor
My grandfather was in World War II and fought in Europe in Army Infantry, so I have such a huge respect for him, and he's shared some personal experiences with me.
In my grandfather's day, there was a different perspective on war and men that went into war; it was such a patriotic act to fight for your country in the Forties.
I don't think anybody, actor or marine, is ever going to enjoy boot camp. It certainly wasn't at all enjoyable. Informative and educational, yes, but it was pretty tortuous.
I try to leave my work at work, and check my work-baggage at the door before I go outside of here. I'm not a super method actor, and I think that all the answers are inside the script.
