I think it's important to have a dream and to follow your heart.
How someone treats a waiter or doorman can tell you so much about a person.
Depression and anxiety can't fit in your head if you're cultivating feelings of joy and inspiration.
I've always been really into action movies. Since I was little, that was my favorite type of film.
Film and television are just different. Film is cool because it's a complete package. You know the beginning, middle, and end. You can plan it out more, which I like. But with television you get a new script every week, so it's constantly a mystery as to what you're going to be doing.
I was scouted at the age of 10 by a Hollywood agent. I was a really shy, geeky-looking thing, and started in the industry by doing 'extra' work on films.
I love English girls! I adore all their different accents. Who knows, I could find a British girlfriend on my travels!
You can go the route of not living your life at all - and a lot of actors do that, where they just won't even go out of the house at all - but it makes life so unenjoyable. You can't go out, you can't hold hands with your girlfriend, you can't do any of these things.
I've never actually been to prom.
I was home schooled starting in seventh grade.
As soon as you start feeling like you can't trust the person and you need to check his phone or have his Facebook password or look through his messages - as soon as that trust barrier is broken - it's hard to keep a relationship going after that.
I went through a period when I was rebellious and a mess of a person.
Humans make mistakes.
I don't have many walls that I put up.
I'd always loved movies. I watch them all the time; my dad is a huge movie buff.
I've played guitar and piano for a while, so it's really fun to play music on film.
I am such a music fiend. I go after so many different types of music. I'm on iTunes constantly just buying new music!
