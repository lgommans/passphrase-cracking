You know when you bring your voice to different voiceover things like video games and cartoons, and I do tons of stuff like that in voiceovers and whatnot, it's very fun and freeing.
Every time I talk about 'The Shield' I kind of talk about it from three perspectives, as if I'm three people, because I'm a fan of the show. I'm in love with all the other characters and their journeys and their work. But then, as an actor, I love getting this kind of rich material and having to do it. As my character, did my journey finish?
The fun part about doing voiceovers and all that stuff is that you're not yourself; you're some other looking thing and sounding thing and whatever else.
Great film roles, they always take you to another place. I'd love to do more of that, but I keep doing lots of voiceovers, some TV spots, and some film roles have come along, so I'm okay.
