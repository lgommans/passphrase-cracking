Bradford Dillman sounded like a distinguished, phony theatrical name, so I kept it.
My feeling is that you should try to do the things you enjoy most in life. I chose acting as a career because I enjoyed it then as I do now. The only question for me then was, 'Can I make a living at it?'
I prefer to have longevity. I like as great a variety as possible, hopefully to avoid getting stuck in one kind of character, having to do it over and over again. I seek to challenge myself as an actor - and at the same time support my family.
It's essential for an actor to have a hobby for the time when the telephone doesn't ring.
