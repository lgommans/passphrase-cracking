I'm very excited to work with everybody on 'The Bridge' - the cast, the writing staff, the executive producers - the show is really good. I'm very lucky to be a part of it.
I'm a big fan of George Carlin's.
Meryl Streep's got talent, she's got skills. I'm sure she wants to be on 'Cougar Town,' right?
