American,Actor
I write box notes for Kino International, which specializes in distributing foreign films.
All clients' needs and expectations are vastly different.
I am not 100% English, I am actually part Italian and even part Hungarian. Therefore I feel very much part of Europe both in my upbringing and outlook.
As a head-hunter I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing my candidates do well and therefore my clients happy. I want to work with clients more as a partner than simply a head-hunter.
