American,Actor
My advice for upcoming actors is to never give up. If it's in you, keep following your dream no matter what. Perseverence is the key.
I actually wanted to be a police officer like my dad for the longest time, up until my sophomore year in high school when I started doing plays. I did plays when I was little, but in high school, I started getting into acting.
I'm a fan of James Frain's work, especially in 'True Blood.' He was so awesome in that show.
I sometimes like to watch a good, dark, disturbing movie.
I'd like to play an alien, like from 'Starman' or 'K-PAX,' where it's human. I think I'm destined to play an alien.
I've never really been a genre fan. I never grew up reading comic books or was a horror buff.
Filming movies and TV are vastly different. Film is more of slower pace. You usually have more time to develop characters, and it sometimes takes up to 3 months to film one movie. Sometimes you'll spend half the day filming one scene. TV moves much faster. It takes about 10 days to film an episode.
I love Jeff Bridges. You can never go wrong with that guy. I hope to work with him one day.
