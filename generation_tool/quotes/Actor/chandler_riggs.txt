I've never had a haircut where I've gone to a hair cutting place and they gave me an incorrect haircut. So I've been pretty lucky.
I'm a teen boy, so I like seeing blood and guts. I know it's fake, but I'm having fun.
I love video games.
I do a lot of video games - I have a YouTube channel where I record me playing video games with my friends and post it. That's a hobby I have and a lot of what I do in my off time.
I don't really read any comics, but when I got casted on the show, I starting reading 'The Walking Dead' comics. I felt like I needed a better idea of the character.
I'm really into, like, electric pop music and dubstep, things like that.
I really like Deadmau5 and Coyote Kisses. And Foo Fighters too, I like rock.
At home, I have lot of pictures from 'The Walking Dead' and some stuff from comic books. At comic conventions, people will give me a lot of autographed stuff, so a lot of those are on my wall.
My dad was on 'Zombieland,' and I love that movie. So yeah, I think I like the horror genre!
I really liked 'Super 8'. If Steven Spielberg is an executive producer of anything, you know that it's going to be amazing!
We're not much of a camping family. When I was in Cub Scouts, we went camping once, and my dad snored the whole time and kept me up. It wasn't that fun.
In a zombie apocalypse, I expect insane things to happen.
