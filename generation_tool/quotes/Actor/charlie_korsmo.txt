American,Actor
I don't love acting enough to give up my life.
I'm happy with the movies I did, and the movies I didn't do.
Making movies was a real weird kind of adult experience. In a way it was like MIT, in that it was a great education. The big lesson is, people are people. They're smart, funny, creative people, but they're people.
Acting was never something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so it was easy to walk away.
