Irish,Actor
I was always kind of serious. It's nice to be able to play a complete bad boy who's the polar opposite to who I am.
When I was younger, I was hopefully going to do animation and special effects.
Not to belittle what we do as actors, but my wife Helen is a teacher, and she makes a real difference to kids. So it's unusual to see people thinking of us as something special.
How do you try to play 'Captain Hook' better than, or as well as, Dustin Hoffman? You can't. It's perfection.
Part of what I like about the best villains in TV and film is when you feel sorry for them, and that makes you feel even worse for feeling guilty about wanting them to succeed, in some way.
I grew up watching movies and being amazed at the animatronics you'd see in stuff like 'The Dark Crystal,' and all those kinds of movies. So, I'm always enthralled with how they can make it all work, behind the scenes, with the visual effects.
