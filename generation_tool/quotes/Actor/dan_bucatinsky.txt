I'm a writer; I'm a producer. I've certainly spread myself over a lot of different careers.
I would love to be a singer if I had the talent for it. I'd love to be a graphic designer if I had the talent for it. Those are things I've always just admired - the work of other artists.
I was a total theater geek in high school, no question. I was cast in 'Godspell' freshman year - with Vanessa Williams, by the way. She and I are still friends. We went to high school together.
A job is just a job at the end of the day, and work sometimes comes from the most unlikely places.
Being multi-disciplined is always a good thing.
Sometimes we have to take on jobs that we don't love, and I always encourage any creative person to use those as the fuel to do the things that you do love to do, even if they don't pay.
