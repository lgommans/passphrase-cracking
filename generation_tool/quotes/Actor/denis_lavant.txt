French,Actor
Physical expression was my first language: Before I was an actor, I was a dancer, an acrobat, a mime and a street performer.
For a long time, I debated about whether I would make movies or join the circus and work as a clown.
There's no doubt that I owe a lot to my training of stage acting.
It's something that I learned even before I started acting: the movement, the dance of the body, is very important, and it comes before words.
I have 30 years of experience working with Leos Carax, so all the films of Leos Carax are unusual or unique. I look at them as a journey: a journey which is very personal to Leos.
