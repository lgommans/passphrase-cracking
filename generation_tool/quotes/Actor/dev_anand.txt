Indian,Actor
Life is too short. I don't have time to speak slowly.
I keep drawing inspiration from people every day. All of a sudden, something strikes me so hard and dramatically, and then a dream comes - I sit down, cut it off and make a script out of it.
You create a work of art. You do not know whether it will get public sanction. Sometimes outstanding films do no business, and sometimes films which are not so good work.
I was the leading star in 1945. I slowed down my pace of acting assignments after I came into direction.
Motion picture making is a very, very involved affair. It is completely my baby. I'm a thorough professional. I plan films right from the conception of an idea to its final execution.
If I wanted, I could have ruled half of Bombay.
