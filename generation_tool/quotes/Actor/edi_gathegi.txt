Kenyan,Actor
I am sort of an adventurer. I like to explore new places. I don't get to travel as often as I would like but I love it.
I have died in enough TV and films.
I think that different actors go about their preparation differently, but when it comes to acting, I use my imagination.
Villains are fun to play.
New York is the only city that I have ever lived in that I have felt at home.
