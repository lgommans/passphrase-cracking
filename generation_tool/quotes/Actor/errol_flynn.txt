Australian,Actor
The public has always expected me to be a playboy, and a decent chap never lets his public down.
It isn't what they say about you, it's what they whisper.
Any man who has $10,000 left when he dies is a failure.
My father was never anti-anything in our house.
My problem lies in reconciling my gross habits with my net income.
I like my whisky old and my women young.
Women won't let me stay single and I won't let me stay married.
