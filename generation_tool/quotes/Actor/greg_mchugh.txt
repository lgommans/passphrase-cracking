Scottish,Actor
I do have very high customer service standards - I'd send back sushi because it's too fishy.
Any opportunity I can get to showcase different characters, I absolutely love.
Most of the meetings I get are in London, and in terms of travelling, I was getting so used to the Virgin train, I knew most of the staff by name.
It's not like there's no work in Scotland, but speak to any actor, and they'll tell you it's limited. So you have to go to London or Manchester to broaden your horizons.
I live in east London, but I'm not cool.
To combine telling an interesting story with brilliantly written characters is the most difficult thing to do.
I went to uni and then drama school afterwards and lived in quite a few student houses.
Socially, I think I'm quite comfortable; I enjoy chatting to people... but I do have my quirks.
