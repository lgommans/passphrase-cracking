American,Actor
You can always tell a novice rider; they aren't comfortable in the saddle and have to hang on.
My journey has been that of a character actor.
I've worked with the great and the not-so-great. But mostly I've worked with men and women who loved their profession, and who like me, had kids to raise and houses to pay for.
I was an expert horseman.
I loved Allan Dwan. He was a tough old guy.
