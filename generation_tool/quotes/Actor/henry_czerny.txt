Canadian,Actor
I wasn't one of those people who went to see a play and said, 'I want to be an actor.' I fell into it.
My dad thought I'd end up in the poorhouse or in doughnut shops with a bag full of reviews.
The bad guys I play don't want to be bad. It's the struggle between the part of them that's an animal and the part that's the intellect that's interesting.
I've refused roles because they're too simplistic.
