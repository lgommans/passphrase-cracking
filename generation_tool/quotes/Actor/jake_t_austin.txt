Having constant supporters and people who are always there and always giving back and knowing that they're loving what you're doing is always awesome to see.
I was born and raised in New York, so I was blessed - or some say cursed - with a strong New York accent.
I'm pretty versatile. I'm able to adapt to an environment and the way I view things based on who I'm with.
With voice over work, you need to convey as much emotion as you can without making any physical movements, so it's hard. You've got to visualize everything.
My best feature would have to be my hair. That sounds so cliche - but my hair is like a separate entity.
I've never been innocent, but I don't think I'm a bad kid! I didn't get voted prom king. I was kind of the dancer, the performer, but I was always very athletic, too.
'The Glass Menagerie' by Tennessee Williams is a great play. I had to read it for school when I was younger, but I started writing scripts after that. That's what got me into writing.
I think everyone sings in the shower.
I have to at least get a couple weekends in where I can just be on Santa Monica beach or Malibu and just ride the waves.
It's important to have a fallback and other activities that keep you interested. I started acting when I was about nine or 10 years old. My father was a midtown firefighter so I always wanted to be a firefighter, but then acting came along. I have to have a plan B.
