Australian,Actor
I was Santa Claus in first year of primary school, our elementary's school play, because I had most panache, that was probably why. I was 5.
I wear a lot of things for fun. Sometimes I'll wear one item that is deliberately stupid because that will make the outfit cool.
Luckily, I haven't been offered any $300 million movies that I hate. So I'm not in that predicament just yet.
With Outlook bikers in Australia, if you've got a little emblazoned thing that's got 'one percent' on it, that means you're one percent of the population and a dangerous criminal. If it's '99,' it means you're kind of a nice recreational biker. If it's 'zero percenter,' it just shows you're a total deadbeat.
I was either told or I realised on my own terms that if you're going to be star-struck with the people you're working with, you're not going to work very well.
