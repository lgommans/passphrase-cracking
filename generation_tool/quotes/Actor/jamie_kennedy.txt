American,Actor
I'm really kind of a vampire at heart.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath, would you be standing the the horror section?
All I can do is put on my armor and brace for the arrows.
It's the millenium, motives are incidental.
There are certain rules one must abide by in order to succesfully survive a horror movie.
Being in all of my relationships, I'm even more confused than I've ever been, I don't know if you ever really understand relationships.
I like doing interviews. I really do.
I have to have some of my voice because I have my own experiences that I lived through.
People want to hear the gossip. They don't want to hear about the shots.
I think anybody can be a good actor.
I'd like to be a wounded leading man. Instead of a pillar of strength, I'd be the scared one.
I like to be creative and I'm lucky that I have a couple of different outlets, and I'm lucky that I get to use them.
There are so many people in the world and not everybody knows who I am, some people do, but I just don't think a lot of people know who I am.
I've probably wanted to be a rapper since I was a teenager. I was an actor and comedian and stuff, but I always wanted to rap, it was another outlet.
I wasn't planning on being a comedian; I just liked to laugh. Somebody said I should do it and that's how I started.
