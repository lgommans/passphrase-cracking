American,Actor
I don't understand leggings. They were the worst trend of the '80s.
I actually cried during 'Titanic'. It was one of the few movies I've seen in the theater multiple times.
Math and science were my favorite subjects besides theater.
I talk to my parents more than anybody in my family.
Morning breath is the worst.
There is a little chubby kid in me just waiting to bust out. I usually go running but am looking for a good gym.
