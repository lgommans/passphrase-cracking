Most of all, I really wanted to become a filmmaker, and I've used every acting experience to just turn it into film school.
A misfit like me getting anywhere in Hollywood as I somehow have, seemed, certainly at the time of 'Spanking The Monkey,' kind of out of reach, or not a very realistic take.
Self-promotion has never been a point, and I'm incredibly inept at self-promotion.
All the filmmakers I've worked with have taken my desire to educate myself very seriously.
What I've been doing with my misfit, so-called acting career in film from day one on my first film, 'Spanking The Monkey', is, I've kind of made a concerted effort to hijack my acting career to turn it into film school, because I've always had the blasphemous idea of becoming a reasonably competent filmmaker in my own right some day.
I've always been pathologically skinny.
