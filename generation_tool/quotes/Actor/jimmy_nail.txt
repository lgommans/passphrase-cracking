English,Actor
I find it very hard to play a part, then take it off like a cheap suit and become Mr Normal - Mr. Nice Guy.
If you think before you speak the other guy gets his joke in first.
Even now I can't stand being recognized in the street. I just hate it when strangers come up and try to talk to me. I'm pathologically shy.
I couldn't make sense of things. But then I began the process of civilising myself and trying to become a decent human being. I'm still working on it.
I haven't got the kind of discipline where I can turn my emotion inside out and then just switch off. It affects me fairly profoundly and I don't like putting myself through that kind of mincer every day.
I was racing through life, utterly confused and angry. I don't know if I was out of control; it was more like I felt frustrated with myself and everything I saw happening around me.
I went from being totally unknown to getting stopped every time I went out. I always wanted to be successful, but I have never wanted to become a celebrity. I never, ever, craved that.
I've gradually grown more comfortable with who I am and what I am.
I've had a blessed career, and that has been acknowledged in many ways over the years.
The older I've got, the easier I've found it to accept myself. I think I've finally learnt not to beat myself up so much.
The whole fame and fortune thing is addictive.
