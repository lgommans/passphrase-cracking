New Zealander,Actor
As actors, we have a philosophy, which is this: great fun. That has transmitted itself into the dwarf philosophy of life. We're up for a brawl, we're up for a bloody good feed, and if you've got food, well, we share what we've got, and so should you.
I'm in love with the entire industry and every aspect of performing and directing, even writing, and I love working with acting students.
