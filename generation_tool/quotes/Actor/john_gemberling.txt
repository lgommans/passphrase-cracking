I don't generally exercise that much. I exercised a great deal in my life - at times. In periods.
It's funny, I used to do a character that was just a baby - just an adult baby. I would get up onstage and complain about adult stuff, but as a baby. I was in a diaper, and I would require hugs from the audience and reassurance and stuff.
I did spend much of my 20s sitting on a couch playing video games and ordering disgusting food.
I've had one or two personal trainers at different times - and it's expensive, first of all - but they always make me feel uncomfortable because they're jocks who just yell at you.
