I'm sort of known in the comedy community as 'Smooth Sailing,' just 'cause everything always goes great. I've always had success at every turn.
I didn't necessarily set out to think of a show to make fun of reality shows.
There's nothing wrong with fame, but to seek out the spotlight just to be on TV for the sake of being on TV, and to put your children on there, I think, is especially disgusting.
What one person might see as violent, someone else may see as beautiful. Maybe even art.
For the most part, people don't know who I am.
If you want to be a crazy person, go for it. But don't impose it on your kids.
There's a big difference to me between the people who are famous and just accept the fact that it comes with the territory of what they do, and the people who actively seek it out, who intentionally put themselves in the position of being on camera and being famous.
