The thing about the Air Force or any branch of the military is that all of us were plucked away from our homes and our comfort zones and our families. So there was a solidarity in the military, a brotherhood.
If you want something, you can't wait for someone to make it happen for you.
I'll always be an actor first. I grew up doing musical theater, so music and acting, to me, have always gone hand in hand. I'm going to be an actor first because it's my career, but music will always be a part of me.
One of my favorite things about 'Castle' is the fact our writers and producers are so collaborative. They allow us to bring in ideas, and they try to make them happen for us.
I'm a simple kind of guy, so I just envision myself being happy.
It's awesome when people even notice that I'm an actor.
I hope to be making television shows and films, and creating content that captivates Latinos. I try not to think about it too much, though. I'm more focused in the present.
I don't come from a lot of money and wasn't going to get an academic scholarship, so the only way to afford an education was to allow the military to supplement it.
It ended up taking eight years to finish college because I got deployed and went overseas.
I don't really like roller coasters!
I always want to portray veterans in a positive light, and since I got into acting full time, I've made that part of my goal.
