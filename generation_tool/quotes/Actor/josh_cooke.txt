When you're running around and playing, it's amazing ground for imagination, and that's really the biggest muscle you need for anything in the arts. I think it's probably the biggest training I've had.
I love to teach, especially high school-aged students, because I like introducing them to the absolute basics of everything they're ever going to learn, the things I wish I had learned at that age. It's the stuff you can always go back to in terms of absolute fundamentals.
My wife, aside from being amazing in general, was really the catalyst in this, and I really owe a lot of the move to New York to her. She reminded me I've always wanted to do move to New York for theater and said, 'Let's stop talking about it and do it.'
