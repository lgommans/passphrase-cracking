I don't think anyone can really make up their mind and say, Now I'm going to be a director.
If I'm not moved by what happens at the end of this play, then I've completely failed, and so has the play, and so has our production. And if that's the case then there really isn't any reason to want to do it.
If you're playing the character, you could say to yourself in 16 different ways, What if that didn't bother me? What if I knew exactly what he was talking about? What if I didn't get excited?
People come along and impose their own stuff on plays, and it shows.
Some stage directions you just simply have to throw away.
