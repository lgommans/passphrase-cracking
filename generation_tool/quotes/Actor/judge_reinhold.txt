American,Actor
I think I started out because I was desperate for approval and acceptance and praise. Some actors never break away from that. They're after that validation their whole life.
My first sex scene - and it was with myself.
I was a lousy waiter, dealing with people and having people in your face like that.
I was spoiled and I was arrogant. I was very demanding, had an overblown image of who I was and got a reputation for being difficult. And rightfully so.
I don't know one actor that became an actor for healthy reasons.
