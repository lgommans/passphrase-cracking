American,Actor
If you have a lot of sweetness and quirkiness, someone's got to have a little bit of bite against that.
I love being in public places, but I can't stand long, drawn-out music festivals.
I've known I wanted to do this ever since I was a little kid and I used to get in trouble at church for goofing off all the time: mocking the preacher, imitating people and the things they did. I later learned my mother used to be just as goofy as I was when she was younger. I mean, Eddie Murphy in 'Coming to America?' My hero.
In TV, you're always confused because you legitimately don't know what you're doing the next week.
I think it's hilarious that you would give an endorsement deal to someone who you've heard their lyrics a million times and you thought it was cool. And then they said something a little messed up and you take the endorsement deal away.
I had this job at Hollywood Video, and during my worst audition ever, I forgot all of my lines in front of Chuck Lorre at the callback for the 'Mike and Molly' pilot.
I grew up in Chicago, IL. I've got three siblings.
I'm a big sports fan - mainly basketball.
If I wasn't acting, I'd be teaching acting. That would be my easiest thing to fall back on is teaching it.
