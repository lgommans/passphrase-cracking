American,Actor
As soon as people see my face on a movie screen, they knew two things: first, I'm not going to get the girl, and second, I'll get a cheap funeral before the picture is over.
I love Marlon Brando. Never seem him bad, just less good.
Tequila. Straight. There's a real polite drink. You keep drinking until you finally take one more and it just won't go down. Then you know you've reached your limit.
I only make movies to finance my fishing.
If I have any appeal at all, it's to the fellow who takes out the garbage.
Newman has it all worked out. I get a million. He gets a million two, but that includes $200,000 expenses.
