I picked up reading late because I grew up dyslexic. When I went to college, a friend who was a big reader got me started on a number of writers, including Hemingway.
I'd forgotten it's an important thing to give thought to your morality and how you intend to live your life.
With TV, you have so much to get done during the day that you don't really have a lot of time to feel your way through it. I know before I walk on the set exactly what I'm going to do. With film you can kind of find your way in it a little more, play with it some.
I tried surfing once in Brazil, but I'm kind of clumsy.
A month before graduation I got an off-Broadway job. Then I did some commercials, including one for MCI. You can only see half of me, but it paid well. Thank God for commercials.
Not even my excellent training at Juilliard prepared me for my first movie role, where I played a transsexual who falls in love with a military guy in 'Soldier's Girl.'
I don't really get recognized.
I love that you work out relationships with people as you're filming just to get something real to play on screen.
I grew up in a house with dogs. We always had dogs. We always had a bunch of dogs, actually.
It's the writers' job to make it positive. It's my job to make it real.
