Australian,Actor
I never thought I'd be an expert at sword fighting, I never thought I'd be an expert in protein powders - I'm close to being an expert in both. It's great!
As a younger actor, my motivation may have been 'Do you want that job or don't you?' Now it's 'Do you want to look like crap on film?'
I've always been stubborn.
I don't like losing.
I don't like failing at anything.
Every actor dreams of getting a big break, a big opportunity.
As an actor, you never try to be someone else. You can't.
