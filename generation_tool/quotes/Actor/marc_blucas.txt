American,Actor
I'm a workaholic, so I read everything that's out there.
Most of the time, actors respond to the thing that's so far from who they are. We all want to play the serial killer and the ex-con.
If a filmmaker and I don't get along, it's four weeks of your life, so, whatever. With TV, it's six years.
Every kid in America dreams of playing in the big leagues and they don't, just because. It's not because they blew out their knee. It's just because they didn't make it.
You see so many different personalities and mind-sets in the world of sports, just like you do with actors.
Team sports, there's always some kind of sacrifice happening... A team, if we lose, if Michael Jordan has a bad night, you hang it on him a little bit... but if you lose as a tennis player, you have no one to blame but yourself, and that's a different beast.
