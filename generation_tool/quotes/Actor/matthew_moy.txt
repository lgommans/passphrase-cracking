There's nothing wrong with being proud of who you are. It's a wonderful thing.
The comedy on '2 Broke Girls' always comes from a place of love - it's never mean. We're a comedy, and we often go right to the edge. It doesn't bother me. I've encountered this all my life. I've been made fun of all my life.
I took Japanese in high school. I'm Chinese, though, and I just fell in love with the language and the culture.
I was going to be the next big voice-over thing, of course, in my mind. I didn't.
On-camera stuff just hit. I decided to do it to supplement my voice-over career, but I ended up falling in love with it, and it actually hit a lot harder than my voice-over career.
'iCarly' was one of my first major jobs, actually. I went into that audition and completely failed at it. I completely bombed... I forgot my lines. When I forget my lines, I kind of get angry. They had me do it again; I remembered them, and I booked it.
I'm here to make people laugh and help them forget their troubles, too! So I just try to bring heart and bring jokes!
Every now and then, people will recognize me at restaurants or Universal Studios or something. I'll always take a picture with them if they want. I mean, that's what telling stories and acting for a living are for - for the people.
When I yell at my TV, it's usually watching... usually it happens during the election. There's when I'm watching CNN and MSNBC.
I watch the weirdest things. I watch old episodes of 'Golden Girls' because my mom watches it, so I grew up watching that. Sometimes I watch reruns of 'Futurama,' which is a cartoon and not based in the real world at all.
In my living room - it's probably going to be moved to my office soon because it freaks too many people out - I have a huge seven foot statue of 'Seven of Nine' of 'Star Trek Voyager.'
I cannot tell you how many times I have seen the original 'Steel Magnolias' with Dolly Parton and Sally Field and Julia Roberts.
