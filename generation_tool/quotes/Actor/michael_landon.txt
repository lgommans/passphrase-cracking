The one thing I need to leave behind is good memories.
I love my work. I've had three successful series, and I want to find out if I can make a fourth.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think viewers are hungry for shows in which people say something meaningful.
Every script I've written and every series I've produced have expressed the things I most deeply believe.
I want people to laugh and cry, not just sit and stare at the TV.
Less than 1 percent of the patients treated are alive at the end of five years.
Dreaming is one thing, and working towards the dream is one thing, but working with expectations in mind is very self-defeating.
I felt my father's presence with me, helping me to commit to paper the feelings I had. I really heard my father speaking to me from the other dimension.
I don't have expectations. Expectations in your life just lead to giant disappointments.
I believe that there is God in all of us.
Boy, you gotta be real sick to get this much attention.
I believe in God, family, truth between people, the power of love.
I don't mind dying if I have to, but I'm damned if I want to pay for the guarantee. I'm sorry.
I think all of us create our own miracles.
I'm going to beat this cancer or die trying.
I'm not the kind of person who gives up without a fight.
I've fought hard and now I'm weary to the bone.
I've got nine kids, nine dogs, three grandkids - and one in the oven. And three parrots!
I've had a good life. Enough happiness, enough success.
Life has been good to me. It's not like I missed an awful lot. I had a pretty good lick here. Every moment gets a little more important.
Now I won't have to worry about the new series making it or not.
With a houseful of kids you give each other strength.
You can die of the cure before you die of the illness.
