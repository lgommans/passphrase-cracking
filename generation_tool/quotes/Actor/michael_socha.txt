English,Actor
Sometimes I like to go out; sometimes I like to chill and do nothing.
An accent like mine and a face like mine, I think a lot of the time it's easy for casting directors to just stick me in as a bad boy, but 'Being Human' took a risk on me - bless 'em - and I'm not that bad boy no more.
I love watching people, guessing what they are going to do next. I'm no Derren Brown, but I love that people stuff. Maybe that's why I'm an actor.
I always get nervous when I watch what I'm in. Very self-critical.
I was never on the side of the teachers at school. Even though I put all the work into getting the main role in the end-of-year musical when I was 11, they didn't give it me, even though they knew I should have had it. That sort of drove me into am dram and getting the main part in another production. And I did.
I should have lived through the '80s, not been born in it. My style is a mix of hip-hop and '80s casual.
I love my Nike Air Max trainers. They're big and bulky and spanking - I can't be doing with grubby trainers.
The only things I could do were English, drama and history. I loved them subjects, but I hated everything else.
To act for a living is a gift, and understanding you're a lucky bloke keeps your feet on the ground.
