American,Actor
A perfect day would be to get into the car, drive out to Yosemite and go camping.
I was a bio major, and I was going to take over my aunt's dental practice and be a dentist.
Filming in India was one big adventure. For 'The Cheetah Girls', we were in Mumbai for two weeks, then Rajasthan for six weeks. Every day after shooting, I would hop into a rickshaw and start exploring the city. I even learned a bit of Hindi. It's such an amazing place to visit.
The CW likes to hold on to its shows.
Even when I was doing well in acting, my dad would say, 'You can still go back to dental school.' But since I've been on '90210,' I haven't heard that.
My first car was a 1986 Toyota pickup.
You never play age, you play character.
Childhood bullying was a big part of my life.
I moved in fourth grade in the middle of the school year, and I was the new kid in school.
I think when your imagination goes to work, and when you're first bullied, you feel like you're going to die. School becomes a war zone, and you can't function.
My mom pushed me to take drama class.
I've always been huge into martial arts.
I love traveling; it's, like, my perfect escape.
Anybody who's been to Ecuador wants to go back because it's beautiful out there.
I've always been more in touch with my Ecuadorian side. I speak Spanish.
I broke into acting doing Latino roles. I played a Latino casanova in 'The Winner' and a Latino character on 'Hannah Montana.'
I love Shah Rukh Khan! I have seen many of his movies.
I'm a first-generation American, so I had friends from several cultures while growing up, including Indian and Iranian friends.
I discovered that I wanted to be an actor back when I did my first play in junior high. I've been doing theater in junior high and high school, and I just kept feeding the fire, kept wanting to pursue acting full-on.
