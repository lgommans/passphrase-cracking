American,Actor
Dr. Larry and Viki are the only original characters left on the show.
The show was number one in the ratings, Gordon Russell was our head writer, the story lines were magnificent and the acting most exciting. I loved working with Judith Light and all the other actors on the show at that time.
Also, if I did join another show, I'd end up burning my bridges to the show I love most.
When we moved back to the US, folk music was all the rage. So I traded in my banjo for a guitar.
This was great fun and a nice paycheck and then, as these things happen, the show was canceled.
I still play the guitar and piano, but hardly ever in public.
