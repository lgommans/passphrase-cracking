The good thing about being on a show like 'Justified' is that you stick to the premise, but not necessarily every single word that's on the page.
Tim Olyphant is a machine. He never stops thinking and being creative.
The beauty of the characters on 'Justified' is that all the human beings that are written are all flawed. Even with the good guys, you see darkness surface.
