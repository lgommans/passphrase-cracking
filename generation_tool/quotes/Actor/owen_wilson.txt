American,Actor
You can think of Hollywood as high school. TV actors are freshmen, comedy actors are maybe juniors, and dramatic actors - they're the cool seniors.
I have never taken myself that seriously as an actor.
It's funny how it usually works out that I end up dying. It sort of works out, because by the time I die, I'm usually tired of working on that particular movie, so I look forward to it.
I definitely would like to do some more dramatic roles.
I think the way it works is that when you're casting a movie, you usually want to work with people that you believe in.
Movies I liked growing up were like Francis Ford Coppolla movies and Scorsese movies.
