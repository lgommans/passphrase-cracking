A cigar is as good as memories that you have when you smoked it.
Why pay $100 on a therapy session when you can spend $25 on a cigar? Whatever it is will come back; so what, smoke another one.
Maybe it's like becoming one with the cigar. You lose yourself in it; everything fades away: your worries, your problems, your thoughts. They fade into the smoke, and the cigar and you are at peace.
I even smoke in bed. Imagine smoking a cigar in bed, reading a book. Next to your bed, there's a cigar table with a special cigar ashtray, and your wife is reading a book on how to save the environment.
It was a very profound experience, getting in touch with that part of us, in all of us human beings, that is committed beyond yourself to the point of giving everything you have, including your life, for other people, for your fellow man.
Just the fact that I've lived more, and I'm not concerned about when I am going to get my next job anymore. This business is free-lance and it's not a steady job. Younger, I would have been more preoccupied with myself.
Sometimes we used to eat once a day... chicken backs. You could buy four chicken backs for a quarter.
You have to have the right atmosphere, really be in the right mood to really fully enjoy a Cohiba.
We tend to think of meditation in only one way. But life itself is a meditation.
I knew there was something special about the theater for me something beyond the regular reality, something that I could get into and transcend and become something other than myself.
There are 38,000 people dying of hunger each day and most are children. And, being a celebrity, I communicate about it as much as I can.
I have a very deep care for Latin America, and, of course, for what was going on in El Salvador.
I remember I was like five or six years old; I played the devil. That was my first role.
Instead of acting in court, I decided to act onstage.
Thank God for the theater.
