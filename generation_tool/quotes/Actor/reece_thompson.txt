Canadian,Actor
I'd love to create my own stuff. I've always written stuff, but it would be nice to have my hand a little deeper in the clay, so to speak.
A couple of friends and I started a sketch comedy group when we were teenagers, just for fun and to start creating stuff. It was a blast.
Regardless of what level the actor's at, you always learn something. And you can learn something from bad actors as well, who I've also worked with in the past.
It's always a learning experience every time I'm on set.
You learn from everything.
My ex-girlfriend said to me, 'I'm surprised at how normal you are since you were homeschooled.' But I was only homeschooled because I wanted to be an actor. My parents are both teachers.
When I was 10 or 11, I was on this TV series called 'Dead Man's Gun' and Henry Winkler was a guest star. He hung out with me and my brother the whole time. We had no idea who he was. Our parents were star struck.
A friend and I started a band together. I am kind of learning how to play instruments. We write stuff over Skype or e-mail. I send one part and he writes another.
I love 'Skins'. I was a huge fan of the British series. I love how everyone is freaking out about it.
I'm not a big sweet guy, I have more of a savory palate.
