For me, comedy and drama are all the same thing.
I've lived in Paris. I've lived in the Slovak Republic. I've spent extensive time in England, and I've traveled all over Europe.
I learned early in life that laughter is a great way to diffuse and uncomfortable situation, so I began to use that as a tool, throughout my life.
I'm not really volunteering for no family films. I really like the sweet spot of being able to be edgy and controversial.
I worked for this company that repossessed cars. Sure enough, the day after I quit, they repossessed my car, but that would probably be my strangest job to date. You have to work your way up to become a hardcore repo man.
I had a grandmother who would always encourage me to learn about theater and film.
My experience in the music industry made me very thick-skinned. Your art is something very personal and there's never a shortage of critics when it comes to art.
