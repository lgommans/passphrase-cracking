I loved 'The West Wing'; it's my favourite-ever television show.
I was watching a Storyville documentary called 'Blackfish' about killer whales in captivity. I was emotionally drained by the end. It revealed a real behind-the-scenes truth on what we do with animals.
I've always loved the writing of Aaron Sorkin. He cleverly intersperses big issues alongside personal relationships.
I always had a soft spot for Sandra Bullock.
I've just finished a book called 'The Time Traveler's Wife', which I really enjoyed, but that's quite old, but I have read it. I've read it, and I enjoyed that.
When I was 15, I went on a cricket tour of Zimbabwe with my school. My defining memory of it was stroking a semi-tame lioness at a game reserve. I grew up on a farm, so I felt I had an affinity with animals, and when it put a paw out, I thought I'd connected with it. But its claws came out and nicked my leg. Then I did the most stupid thing: I ran.
The most adventurous I've been was doing Raleigh International when I was 20.
I've done a lot of period dramas, but I love modern productions, too.
Essentially, I never know what I'm going to do until I read the script, but a good story is a good story. I would like to do more modern stuff, but ultimately, it doesn't matter to me - good stories are timeless.
There are many actors I admire, but I always look at people who have done a variety of roles - people such as Simon Russell Beale or Ralph Fiennes.
I always think people who stretch themselves are interesting. That's something to admire, isn't it?
