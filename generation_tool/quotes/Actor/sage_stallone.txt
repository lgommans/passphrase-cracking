To tell you the truth, I was turning into a little spoiled brat after 'Rocky V.'
People call me a hermit. But I'm happy.
In 'Rocky' and 'Paradise Alley,' my dad played very expressive characters, and he was out there.
I would love to go to film school.
Next to filmmaking and stuff like that, skiing is my favorite thing. I go skiing in Aspen - everywhere. I have been skiing since I was 4. I just love it. I feel so free.
I was an easygoing guy, and school was pretty much people trying to challenge me to a fight, y'know, saying, 'Rambo! Rocky!'
My father realizes that he did okay with me. He did the best he could.
