When you turn up in Leicester Square and there are 5,000 people screaming your name and holding placards, that's just weird. It's hard to find a place for it in your brain that makes any sense. I'm not really comfortable in that sort of situation.
I've always been fussier than I can afford to be. I don't just want to do whatever it takes to be successful, I want to do what I consider to be good stuff. If I'm not engaged in something, it doesn't matter what it is and who's doing it.
It's good to have a foothold in reality, a base somewhere that's always been a base. Sharman Macdonald once said she needs life to write; she can't write if she's just in theatre all the time. I'm the same way, I think. I've always felt that if my life was all about the job, I wouldn't be so good at the job.
Being a Scotsman, I wear a skirt quite a lot, but we're allowed. I have an incredibly loud Hawaiian shirt that's pink and a particularly disgusting turquoise, but I just wear it on days when I'm in a strange mood.
I've read the 'Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy' at least once a year since I was twelve years old.
