I am running for governor of Kentucky as the people's advocate.
We need to stop the erosion of parental authority.
It's time for these people to have accountability for what is being done.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky has a judicial system, and this system needs a lot of repair. Therefore, there is no need for Kentucky to start building another judicial system within the system, that we already have.
I will cut all state taxes by at least one third.
