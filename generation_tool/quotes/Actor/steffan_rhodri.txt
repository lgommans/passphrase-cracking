Welsh,Actor
I love the instant gratification of theatre - it reminds me of why I enjoy filming in the first place.
I'm a Jack of all trades character actor, really.
My ego thinks I would like to be considered for more heavyweight roles, but the price you pay for that is they are always the same kind of roles.
I never imagined myself doing a one-man show. If I'm going to do one, I'd rather do one that breaks all the rules.
I've been a huge cricket fan since my teens, and I often used to go down to St. Helen's in Swansea in the summer. To me, it was like a 'rites of passage' experience to have the freedom of St. Helen's cricket ground.
I used to spend countless days in my teenage years keeping scorecards, playing cricket and just enjoying myself with friends and having the occasional shandy in the bar.
I played quite a bit for my home team, Morriston, in my teens. I batted and bowled, but I suffered the utter humiliation once when one of the Pontarddulais batsmen hit 32 runs in one over against me.
