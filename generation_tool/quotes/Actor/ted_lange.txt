Stax was rejoicing in the difference in who we are, and that's what you see in the film.
Artists should always think of themselves as cosmic instruments for storytelling.
I've always tried to explore the humorous aspects of life.
I suddenly discovered that acting made girls notice me.

I've played almost every lead character from Henry VI to Othello. I'm dying to tackle Richard III sometime.
I believe in Christianity, Judaism and Islamism, but I stay away from churches, synagogues and mosques.
I seek a deeper truth, but I don't think I have to go to a building designated for worship to find it.
I talk to the universe all the time.
One of the things we're taught as actors is restraint - don't jump off the cliff.
To me, the job of a playwright is to explore and bring to light our lives. You can't hold back; you have to give in to this. Sometimes, you say things people don't want to hear.
