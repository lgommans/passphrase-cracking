American,Actor
For if you do, then shouldn't we blame the whole fraternity system? And if the whole fraternity system is guilty, then isn't this an indictment of our educational institutions in general? I put it to you, Greg - isn't this an indictment of our entire American society?
I like real stories.
With comedy, you really want to work things out beforehand.
I was born and raised in L.A. My father was born and raised in L.A. So we're old hands here.
I always wanted to be an actor. I was one of those lucky kids - or cursed kids - who always knew what he wanted to do.
I love J. F. K. My mother had been a worker on his campaign and adored him.
You know, I'm a big comic book fan. As a kid I used to collect them until there was a horrible mudslide in Hollywood and I lost my collection, but I was also at an early age the voice of 'Jonny Quest;' it was a cartoon; so I am kind of a latent fan boy.
