I grew up in a household that was very close, very open, and always talking about what was going on with each other.
I grew up - for a while, the only show I could watch if I hadn't finished my homework was 'The Simpsons,' because I think my parents saw that there was some real-life lessons to take from that.
We would finish dinner, and then we'd all sit around as a family and watch 'Roseanne.' That was a big one.
I really got to see my dad enjoy every day that he was working. Everybody should be able to have this much fun when they go to work.
