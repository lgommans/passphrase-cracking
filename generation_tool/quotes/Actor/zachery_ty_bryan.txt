American,Actor
I'm just a person who forgives and forgets. I have a hard time holding grudges.
Well, when you get into the business, what you have to realize is that signing autographs and getting 'bothered' is just part of the deal. It's not a bother to me at all. That's part of being an actor and that's something you have to realize before you ever get into this business.
I don't miss acting at all.
A lot of people try to paint this child actor stigma, but I always looked at it as a great opportunity.
I had phenomenal parents. They kept me very grounded, and I lived a normal life.
