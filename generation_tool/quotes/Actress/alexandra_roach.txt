Welsh,Actress
Be positive and laugh at everything.
That's where my passion was ignited, on the set of 'Pobol Y Cwm.' I loved it and I've had such a passion for TV and films. I can't do anything else.
I had to live and breathe Margaret Thatcher for a few months. I totally engulfed myself in her life. I read her autobiography and a biography, 'The Grocer's Daughter.'
My ambition is to become one of those actresses that is like a chameleon that you don't recognize.
Transformations don't scare me: it thrills me to become the polar opposite.
I went to stage school with a neighbor to build confidence because I was quite shy.
Actresses are mental on the whole. But I think I'm pretty normal.
I can't wait until I'm able to afford really posh bags.
Nobody puts Roach in the corner.
I think you should just wear something you feel comfortable in. It's important to make a statement, but don't kill yourself over it.
I love leaving the house in a new outfit; I don't feel the pressure at all.
I think the most important thing is to have fun, and not to take things too seriously. Once you start doing that, then you'll start to crumble.
It's important to make a statement, but don't kill yourself over it. You have to make an effort, but not go overboard.
I love vintage, but it's so expensive now.
Hairpieces are brilliant for adding volume.
I love all reality TV - Strictly, 'The X Factor.' I really don't see why people are so snobby about it.
