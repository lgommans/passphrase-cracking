I think every role you get is going to be a powerful one. As long as you go in with the mindset of, 'Yeah, I'm going to make the most of this.' So that's the kind of attitude I take into each role that I play.
In real life I am a bit of a tomboy. I like the footy and sports. I am more comfortable in running gear than I am in heels, because I usually trip up in them.
