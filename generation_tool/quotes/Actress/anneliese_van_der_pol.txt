Dutch,Actress
I am pretty sarcastic and pretty dry.
I love to entertain. I love being able to make people laugh.
I wouldn't say that I was a born performer, because I work very hard at it.
The Internet, and Google, and everything that goes along with that is awesome for some things, but not so awesome for other things. Because everything gets leaked nowadays.
It's important on a comedy to have a fun loving set.
If anybody is a master at improvisation, it would be Ken Jeong. He is hilarious.
