Swedish,Actress
Ever since I was four years old, I loved making people smile, making them think, making them feel good, feel some kind of emotion.
The critics had an image of me, and they wouldn't accept any other... I was a cartoon character. A joke.
I just love my privacy.
I always tried to be the perfect little girl. Always tried to have the perfect little manners. Never wanted to displease my parents.
I mostly wear hats or put scarves over my head because I like to have a low profile when I go out.
When I came to America from Sweden, Mother and I, we went to Chicago where our relatives lived.
I've always tried to do my very best, and I want to be the very best age, whatever age I am.
