American,Actress
I've done a lot of television, and there's no rehearsal process - you have to come to the set with your guns blazing and with a point of view.
I have an incredibly supportive husband and family and an incredibly well-adjusted daughter.
I'm most excited to meet Jon Hamm at the Emmys.
You have a lot more freedom when you're the sidekick - you can bring a lot more of your own flavor to the role, and you can get away with a lot more.
I think what really clicked for me was when I started booking commercials as a dancer... just being on set and seeing every element of production, it was magic to me.
It just clicked that it was the next step for me; choreographing didn't interest me, and opening a studio wasn't a passion for me. I didn't know if I'd be very good at acting, but then my first scene in acting class... I just loved it.
I love movies. I'm a nut. There's nothing I would rather do than see three movies a day.
