I really love 'America's Next Top Model.' I'm always tweeting about it, and people are like, 'You need to get a life!' Any time I do a photo shoot, I always think, 'What would Tyra say?'
I have Bob Dylan lyrics on my ribs. I'm a diehard Dylan fan, and my dad and I joke that if I ever met him, I'd have him sign his name right under my tattoo and then I'd run to the parlor to get his signature tattooed.
I couldn't be luckier to wake up every morning and be so excited to get to work, even if it's five in the morning.

I never have had blonde hair. I have never had straight hair. I never wear pink clothes or spray tan and I never wore heels to school.
'Mean Girls' is literally one of my favorite movies. It's just such a classic. Everybody has seen it, and me and my friends quote it all the time.
