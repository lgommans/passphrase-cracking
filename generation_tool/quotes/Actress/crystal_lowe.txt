Canadian,Actress
When I was younger, it was really difficult for me to get acting jobs, because you're a kid and you don't fit in the typical family.
There is so much about modeling that I don't like! What I hate? It makes you so image conscious all the time. I like to be healthy and stay fit. I am constantly thinking that I have to weigh this much, which is always on my mind, regarding working out and watching what I eat.
What I do love is the traveling... and getting paid for it! I like being in front of a camera... It's an outlet. It's fun! If you look through my photo album, they are all modeling poses. My mom was a young mom, so she took tons of pictures of me.
Acting, producing, writing, directing - it's all part of something that I believe I was born to be part of.
