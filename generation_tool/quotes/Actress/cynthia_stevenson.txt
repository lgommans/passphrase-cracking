'The Player,' I loved so much because it was such a labor of love on all levels, and it was such an enormous honor to be in a Robert Altman movie.
I'm all about the story. If I like the character and I think the story's entertaining, I'll do it.
I loved doing 'Dead Like Me.' That role was phenomenal to me.
I think in the world we need more comedy. I wish so much that we could embrace that side of us more. I love to escape through watching comedy, and I wish for more of that in the future.
