American,Actress
A zombie apocalypse isn't the most jovial situation.
Zimbabweans are so smart and witty and able to weave together tons of situations and experiences into terminologies that are just utterly original.
I hate horror movies! I avoid them like the plague. I don't like getting scared.
You Americans, you have no idea how much your stuff infiltrates the rest of the world!
I've always been attracted to action stuff.
My artistic spirit is not nurtured by blogospheres.
Back in the day, I used to read 'Archie,' but I haven't been a comic book aficionado.
I got an M.F.A. in acting from NYU, and part of our training is to learn how to use swords in combat situations in a performance and Shakespeare plays where you have to fight.
I've always been extremely physically active.
I don't care about the quality of the film as a whole, but I loved 'Salt.' I loved it!
I always used to say hybrids would rule the world - people who have an understanding of many cultures and can relate to them with ease. And then along came Obama.
I create fictional narratives, but it's based on literal people.
I love writing for other actors, women of African descent and people who are generally underrepresented.
You look at women like Lena Dunham, you look at how women are kind of crafting their own space on the screen. I want to add to that.
