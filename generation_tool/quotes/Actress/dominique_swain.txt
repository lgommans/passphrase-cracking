Boys always like to see girls kiss. I don't get it; girls don't want to see boys kiss.
I'm open to anything. I think everyone should enjoy every moment that they experience.
Sometimes I think I might insult people by being openly flirtatious, then snatching it back.
Everybody thinks people who promote PETA don't eat meat, but I think animals were made to be eaten.
I eat meat, the rarer the better.
I just don't think animals should be slaughtered for their fur.
Things that bring out your emotions are what should be in theaters and in books. That's what art is. It makes you feel things.
I take my part in the food chain very seriously.
