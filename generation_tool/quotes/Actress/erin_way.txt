American,Actress
Being a woman, an actor in Hollywood, I know that there are certain parts I won't often get a chance to do.
I'm interested in making films that make people think.
Maybe 'Doonby' will haunt people for awhile and make them wonder, 'What was that really about?' And that excites me as an artist.
You name the sci-fi shows, and I'm a huge sucker for them.
