American,Actress
I get paid to go work with people I've admired since forever, and I get to learn from them? What? I would pay to go sit and be a fly on the wall!
I personally don't think you should ever date someone you work with, will work with, etc. I won't ever date an actor.
I'm a total loner. I can't even answer texts or take my phone with me when I'm working!
