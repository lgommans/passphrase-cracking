American,Actress
I spent my summers in Connecticut scooping ice cream and babysitting.
I played lacrosse for a hot second, but I was mainly a swimmer - captain of my swim team.
My dad's great. He's an amazing artist. A sculptor. He's wonderful and supportive. I love going to museums with him - we talk about... everything.
I'm just lucky to have great parents. My sister's an actress. My brother's a musician. I found it hard growing up in such a... creatively driven family. I wanted to have this thing to create, myself.
I wanted to be an Olympic swimmer when I was growing up.
The arts have always been in and around my life.
I'm 23, so I'm not done with my life. But acting, definitely, out of what I've done so far, makes me feel the most alive and is very invigorating and thrilling. So I figured I might as well try it for a while.
There's something magical about theater. You can live the character every single day to the point where you become that person.
I love shawls!
I'm never not nervous before going onstage. Like... what if I fall on my face?
I've been told that I'm good at impersonating people.
