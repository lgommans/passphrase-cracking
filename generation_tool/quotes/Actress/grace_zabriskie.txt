American,Actress
I do less waiting by the phone than anyone I know in the business. I don't wait for a job. I just go on to my own work.
Some people are suspicious of others who have more than one talent. I've had poets tell me to my face that an actress can't be a poet.
The fact is, as actors, everything we do, bad or good, is a contribution. To me, it is a positive thing to give people as wide a range of human behavior with some sense of understanding of that behavior or some clue to it.
