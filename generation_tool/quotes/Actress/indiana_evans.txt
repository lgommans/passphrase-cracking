I have always been ambitious about getting a U.S. role, and if ever there is some frustration, it is still encouraging to get close to big roles because it implies there is somewhere to go.
I admire Cate Blanchett as an actor: that's my ultimate goal. To be as good as she is!
I had been watching 'Home and Away' for quite a while, so joining the cast was quite weird. The show is so fast-paced, and at first it was overwhelming, but at the same time was quite laid back.
When you do a remake, there's a lot of pressure because people always love the original.
I've always thought Juliette Lewis was great.
You have to remember I've been working with adults since I was 12 - they were my peers, and it has an effect, for sure.
