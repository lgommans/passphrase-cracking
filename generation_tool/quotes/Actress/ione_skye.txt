I fell in love with doing yoga.
Chanting was very deep for me. It was as if I remembered it. It was like a real surrender.
I like doing a challenging class because it makes me more brave in life. My perception of hardships is now completely different. I'm not whining and moaning inside as much.
Yoga is a life-saver.
My mom has always been very open, very liberal. So I grew up with that, and I can appreciate everything that she did and went through and was exposed to.
There was a time when I was in this private school and the kids were so conservative and close-minded that it was just appalling.
Young people have so many letdowns that people don't realize.
It's just amazing that there are so many prejudices even now.
