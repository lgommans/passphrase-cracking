American,Actress
I felt like the dark hair added like a toughness to my face also, which was really important.
I've always been really athletic, which really helped, because when I first started doing the training for Bulletproof Monk, it required so much strength that if I didn't have a base I don't really know what I would have done.
We got to jump on, like, trampolines, learn flips, learn karate, kung fu, Hong Kong street fighting.
But the funny thing is, I broke my finger not on set doing kung fu. I broke my finger when I fell down the stairs prior to going on set.
I like doing accents and I like learning as much as I can learn.
I think that's what's great about being an actress is you get to learn so many different things like that, like learning a little bit of Tibetan here, learning a Southern accent there.
