I'm not the kind of person who sits off by myself and ignores everyone. I like to be happy!
I like to just hang out. My friends don't like to do that, but I do. Because, a lot of times I'm busy, and I just kind of like to get a chance to just hang out.
I am a competitive figure skater. I've been doing that for the same amount of time I've been doing acting. Ever since I was two.
Girls need to be strong and know how to stand up for themselves. Definitely having friends is a big part of it, so that they can help you through that, and a strong family.
I really want to be like my mom in some ways, because I already take a lot after her already. I really like the way she treats us and disciplines us, and I think that she's just great because of how she's balanced us and all of that.
