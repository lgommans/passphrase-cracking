American,Actress
I'm very, very private; I don't enjoy talking about myself to strangers. Particularly strangers with tapes going.
I sound New York. I sound East Coast much more than a blonde person from L.A.
I have had friends for years who have never seen my house.
I was brought up not to be selfish or self-centered. So if you play somebody who isn't so lovable, you can play that person and no one will turn on you. I don't want to play that person in real life. Because then people won't like me so much.
Don't ask me about Beverly Hills High School. Everybody hated it. I hated it. Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.
That's the joy of acting - you get to play people who are not you; you get to explore the dark, hidden sides of yourself.
