It would be great to do another television show that was a multi-camera because the hours are so wonderful and you can be a good mom at the same time. The problem is, there aren't a lot of multi-camera shows that I personally like. My aesthetic is more geared toward single-camera shows.
I'm not really the sex symbol type.
I love football.
I trained at The Groundlings and was surrounded by some very funny women and also some very unfunny men. I didn't feel a sense of things being different because I was a girl.
I'd just like to be good at sports. I'm extremely competitive with absolutely nothing to back it up.
Sometimes, I find that just the simplest, cleanest things that are intelligently performed are funniest to me.
