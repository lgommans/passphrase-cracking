American,Actress
I just love to watch people get scared. It's like, 'Yes, I accomplished my goal!'
I was on a sitcom called 'Gary Unmarried' for 37 episodes, and then I was in 'Bad Teacher' with Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.
I loved 'Paranormal Activity.' It was one of my favorites before. It was a tradition; my friends and I went every year.
