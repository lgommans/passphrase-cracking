American,Actress
I want a guy who can clean my gutters and kill my spiders - who's simple yet layered.
In fact, I'm a geek.
I seem to be attracted to the quiet, brooding type. But not too brooding. Too brooding can be narcissistic. Or psychotic.
I like men who are more in their heads.
Hollywood can be an ugly place and it can do ugly things to you.
