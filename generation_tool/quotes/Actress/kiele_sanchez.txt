There is something to be said about a guy who is attractive and doesn't know it. I hate men who are overconfident.
I know with me, you really have to, like, pound me over the head to say, 'I like you. I really like you' to get me to see it. I think if you're too passive, you just fall into that friend role. And that's hard to break out of.
