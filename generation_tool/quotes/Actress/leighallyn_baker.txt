American,Actress
I know a lot of actors picture themselves winning Academy Awards. I really just wanted to do a Christmas movie because it's the kind of movie that I really love to watch. I'm a sucker for the holidays.
Our traditions have been waking up on Christmas morning and feasting on a southern breakfast. I'm from the South. We eat grits and biscuits and gravy and eggs with Ritz crackers and country ham, bacon, you name it.
I was named after my two uncles. Roger Lee and Richard Allen. They simply changed the spelling to Leigh-Allyn to make it more feminine.
Even though I would love a little girl for me, personally, I love being a mom to boys.
I certainly know what it is like to go to work and leave your baby at home. It is an ache that only other mothers can understand. I always say that it feels like you've left a limb at home. And I really struggled for the first few months of work. There were times when I shut myself in my room and cried.
'Having it all' is such an intimidating concept. Just when you think you have all those plates spinning perfectly... something changes. It is a constant balancing act.
I've learned that the perfect picture that I hold in my mind of what my life looks like is constantly changing, growing, evolving. I remind myself that I am exactly where I need to be in my life; otherwise, I would surely be somewhere else.
I have a quick shout out to all the moms... I know it's hard, but try to love your body after baby.
If you're an actress, you're always on one diet or another - it's a way of life.
