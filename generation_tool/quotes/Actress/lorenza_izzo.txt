Boom, I move to L.A. after doing 'Aftershock,' and I've been actually working here. So it's all been 'boom'; it's all been 'boom' everything. It's so exciting. It's been amazing. I'm a very lucky girl.
Whenever I'm terrified of anything, I jump to it.
I go to shady places all the time.
I love kids. I always have. I was an only child until I was 12, and then my sister arrived.
