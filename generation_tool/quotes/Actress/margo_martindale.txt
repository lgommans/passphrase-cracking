American,Actress
I played Big Mama in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' when I was 20 years old at the University of Michigan.
I'm from East Texas, yes.
Texas people are very open, because it's open.
I love Kentucky people, but you have to get on the inside before they accept you.
And I love having the job to go to every week. With movies, there's a lot of downtime. I like working, and television really does that.
In order for me to have fun, I have to be able to not be buttoned down.
