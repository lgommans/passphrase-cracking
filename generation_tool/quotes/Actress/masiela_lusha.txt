Albanian,Actress
Many countries had a hand in raising me. I am the product of many contradicting philosophies and cultures... My entire universe is comprised of these foreign traditions. If any one of these experiences are to be ignored, I wouldn't be the same.
I find time to write the way kids find time to ride their bikes.
I often feel like a pretender when wearing makeup. The most beautiful features in a woman are her character and her experiences. Why hide that?
As an actress, if you find inspiration through my work, then my job is complete.
