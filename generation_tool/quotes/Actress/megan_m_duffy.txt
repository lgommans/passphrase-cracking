I'm a fan of some horror. Some of the really corny b-horror movies I don't love so much, but 'Rosemary's Baby' is one of my favorite movies.
With things like Facebook, it's really easy to think that you know someone that you really don't.
I thought 'Cabin in the Woods' was really incredible.
I normally stay away from horror films; I tend to do light and happy roles.
