Conflict is easy because we've all had conflict, but to really bond with someone and to have a genuine connection, it needs to come from a place by knowing them.
What's odd is that nobody in my family is an artist. My cousins are, like, secretaries at law firms or nurses or just more blue collar. And I was in a baseball team. I used to be, like, a really big tomboy.
I loved high school. I had the best high school experience of all time. I know that's not a common feeling, but it's the best. You're like, you know, 14 and expressing yourself on a daily basis creatively? That's pretty incredible.
I kind of want to learn how to direct TV. It's interesting.
I'm not this big Hollywood mainstream actress, but who cares? I think I just have a certain sensibility for smaller projects. I like intimate things. I think I do well in that kind of environment. That doesn't mean that I wouldn't love to do bigger projects. I feel everyone has their own journey.
I wrote a pilot for myself. It's about a Latina actress trying to make it in Hollywood. It's pretty funny.
I'm tired of playing freaking cha-chas, the sassy CIA agent, the best friend homegirl. I'm tired of that!
I grew up in a family of predominantly female bread winners who are strong and are fierce and opinionated. There's not enough women like that on the screen.
When I have kids, when I have a family and nieces and nephews, I'm gonna teach them to love more and be kinder and to not judge someone by the colour of their skin or any other thing.
