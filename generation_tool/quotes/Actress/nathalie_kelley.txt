Australian,Actress
I'm such a girl because all the guys go for cars because of their engines or something like that. I like the colour and the design.
When you play a character, there's always a part of you. Like, you always bring out a side of you when you do another character.
II grew up in Australia, but I'm not from there originally. Like, my dad's South American, so I know what that's like to grow up in a culture that's not your own.
I feel that 'Tokoyo Drift' blew people away because not many people had high expectations for it.
