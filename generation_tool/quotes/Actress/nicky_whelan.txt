Australian,Actress
I am a very deep person. I run very deep in real life.
I think the Australian men and American men are quite different. I feel like Australian men might be a little bit more laid back and a little bit cool whereas American guys are sort of 'boom, boom, boom.'
It's such a process to get a show off the ground initially. And then, to already have a second season announced is a dream come true for any actor.
I've predominantly done comedy over the years.
A lot of the time, in the past, I have played the pretty blonde in a lot of roles.
Growing up and going out to bars in Australia - people do random things; cheesy pick-up lines... you got to laugh. It's sweet. Some people come up with cracker lines, and you really can't be mean to them.
I'd never heard of a hall pass until I came to America. It sounds like something at school.
I did take a huge leap moving countries. People have no idea how huge it is to relocate overseas. Finding your new life alone is enormous, and then starting a new career in Hollywood is so big.
I'm going to go traveling through Europe and see parts of the world I haven't seen. I've spent so much time in America that I want to check out the rest of the world.
