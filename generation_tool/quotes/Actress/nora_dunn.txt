American,Actress
I never thought I was funny, but I enjoy being funny.
When I'm with my friends I'm funny, but I don't feel like I'm a funny clown.
As an actor, you have to have your history.
I love improvisation.
I prepared for the part by drinking, but I was sober when I was performing.
Milk Duds kept me going.
The gun issue is a big, unresolved issue in this country right now. I think it's out of control.
Years ago I was a runway model, and I used to get laughs. I thought it was a joke anyway.
I think at the end of a show, you have to walk out with a message. That's my hardest struggle right now; that's what I'm working towards.
