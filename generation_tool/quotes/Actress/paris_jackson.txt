I love my dad, and I'm proud to be his daughter.
Some people try to cyber bully me; they try to get to me with words, but that doesn't really work.
I have lots of memories of my father. He was an incredible father. We all loved him to death.
I know my dad always wanted to heal the world, and so I think it would be great to follow in his footsteps.
I want to help people. That's it.
My dad was in the movie 'Moonwalker,' and I knew he could sing really well, but I didn't know he could act. I saw that, and I said, 'Wow, I want to be just like him.'
I just don't think the title 'MJ's daughter' fits me.
I listen to older music like AC/DC.
Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine. And I just want to say that I love him so much.
I didn't get why I was wearing a mask. But I understand it now - why my dad would want our face to be covered.
A lot of people don't like me.
You can be, like, a totally different person on camera, and it's fun. You can take on another character, and it's awesome.
I want to be my own person.
A ton of kids at school have made fun of me; if I had to give advice to other girls, I would say, 'Hang loose and ignore them. They shouldn't faze you no matter how popular they think they are.'
I do have a regular childhood.
I want to have a normal high-school experience.
Now I see other kids and their parents, and I compare them to my dad. Our dad was a really normal father when he was with us. We would get grounded if we did something bad. He would ground us. He wouldn't call it grounding; he'd just say, 'You're on punishment.' Sometimes we'd be on punishment a lot.
There are a lot of bad people out there.
