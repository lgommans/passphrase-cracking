I never wear matching socks. It's kind of a thing that I have!
Fun opens the doors to creativity, which then leads to inspiration, which then births passion, which all together equals both happiness and success!
You can bend, but never break. Stay Unbreakable!
We all have so much more power to make our dreams a reality - and love life along the way - than we think we do!
I really do believe that inner beauty is so much more than any kind of outer beauty.
I believe that we live in a 'return to sender universe' - what you send out is exactly what you will get back.
I'm definitely somewhat of a tomboy. I grew up a pretty big tomboy, actually, and was really obsessed with basketball.
Dancing has always been a passion of mine.
I once said some mean things about someone, and they were standing right behind me. That experience taught me to never talk bad about anyone.
My mom's whole life had been my gymnastics. We struggled to connect when I stopped.
I do interval training, high intensity dance, and yoga. I do run a lot, but more for speed.
