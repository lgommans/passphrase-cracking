Australian,Actress
My mom was an environmental activist in Australia in the late '60s and '70s, and I guess I've inherited that awareness from her.
With today's mass media obsession, it's good to be able to raise awareness about our environment.
It's always exciting to play characters who are obsessive because all their energy is so focused on that one thing and they're eccentric because of it.
When you take a character seriously, there's more room for comedy because you're not aware of how absurd you are.
I can't do victim roles - it makes me sick.
I didn't actually have a prom. In Australia, we call them 'socials,' which is hilarious. I did always find them pretty awkward, because I went to an all-girls school.
What appealed to me about 'The Loved Ones' script was that it had this really theatrical element to it. I thought that the scope of this character is so broad, and there is so much fun to be had playing a crazy teenage loner. It was a great way to explore the delusions a mind can create.
I love period dramas and language, but I love comedy as well.
I have a background in theater. At the time I read 'The Loved Ones' script, I was playing Catherine the Great of Russia onstage. Straight after that, I played Stella in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and Isabella in 'Measure for Measure.'
