American,Actress
The minute I forget to balance reality with the fantasy, I'm going back to Virginia.
'm not saying I would never do acting again, because I love it, but there really is nothing compared to getting up in front of people and singing your music.
I love going into a dive where they have no idea who I am or haven't heard my music and try to win them over.
My parents wanted me to grow up around horses and open spaces.
Part of the reason that I moved to Los Angeles is that even though my mom introduced me to all kinds of music, I really wanted to work on having my own identify, on being who I am and doing what I do, and seeing how people responded.
