Teach your children how to behave with animals. Adopt a pet. Don't go buy one. Please. That's a sin. Let's get these puppy mills out of business.
If we sit by and become complacent and put our heads in the sand, we're complicit.
I love to work.
I'm a character actress.
We have to bring the humanity and compassion back.
