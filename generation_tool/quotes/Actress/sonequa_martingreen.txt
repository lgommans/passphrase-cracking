American,Actress
I do have siblings, but I don't have any brothers.
I have stage combat training from college, which is drastically different than fighting for the screen, but I do enjoy that kind of stuff.
I do tend to be a leader in situations in my own life.
Not being secure affects us as humans. It throws us off our balance. It puts us in disarray.
