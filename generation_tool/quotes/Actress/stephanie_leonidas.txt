The stunt team were great on 'Defiance.' They were there, every day.
I loved 'Roger Rabbit' growing up.
I never really thought about what characters I play. I always just wanted different characters.
The sets on 'Defiance' are incredible. I've never really seen a set like this, where the world is so built around us. There's not too much left for us to have to imagine.

We do a lot of stuff on the green screen as well, but when we're outside in the streets, it's all there. It's amazing! The creators have just been incredible.
If you're working on 'Doctor Who,' you've got to be the Doctor. So yeah, I think they need a woman Doctor, and that's who I'd like to be.
