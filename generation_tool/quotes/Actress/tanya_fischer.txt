I love dive bars, old movie theaters, live music and good food. The simplest things in life for me are the most important.
I love being from Wisconsin.
I'm no producer's kid.
I just want to keep at it. I can't wait to see, after years of being around, the roles I can play when I'm a crazy old lady.
You get callbacks, and they either give it to what they call a 'name' performer, or they decide to go in an entirely different direction.
It's valuable to me as an artist and actor to explore all kinds of outlets. So if a local filmmaker in Milwaukee had a good story, I'd be part of it in a second.
You just have to go to bat and take a swing. And if you're not right for a part, or it goes to a British man, they may remember that you showed up, knew your lines and were good. And maybe they'll call you in for something else.
