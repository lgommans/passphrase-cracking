Actress
When I'm out with my girlfriends at the bar, and I see some young 18-year old boy, just for fun I say, 'Hi honey. Do you like girls? Do you like girls exclusively? Oh, good.'
Whenever women catfight, men think it's going to turn to sex.
They told me I gave the best milk mustache of anybody.
No one's ever happy with their position in Hollywood. You hear that from people you'd never dream would complain.
Does being a feminist mean that I believe that I'm as good as any man? Yes.
I love a man who can wear my underwear.
Guys usually know immediately that I'm high-maintenance.
This is my ultimate fantasy: watching QVC with a credit card while making love and eating at the same time.
I don't think men like a bad girl. Well, I haven't had a date in a year so I'm obviously doing something wrong. It's not that my standards are too high, I haven't even been asked out in a year. I have no standards, anyone, please!
As an actor you're used to being the focus of attention.
