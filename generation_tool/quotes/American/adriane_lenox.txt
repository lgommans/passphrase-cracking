American,Actress
I'd like to one day be able to say, 'I was in more than one play on Broadway.'
I'm a working actress.
Trust me: not everyone is on the Adriane Lenox bandwagon. I'm not stupid enough to think that.
Of course, De Niro has had a long history of memorable performances. Everyone knows 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull,' but 'Awakenings' really did something for me.
I have been a performer for as long as I can remember. I performed in Sunday school and church plays.
My advice to young actors is to push yourself and to aspire to be great.
