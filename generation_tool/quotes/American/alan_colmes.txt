People say to me, 'Why don't you fight fire with fire?' You fight fire with water, not fire.
Genius, scholar, and war hero though he is, you have to admit - or maybe you should think about admitting - that George Bush might have rushed things a little in invading Iraq.
I don't judge my effectiveness by how many words I say. I think liberals often see nuances in things... Conservatives tend to see things in black and white. It gives them an air of certainty and conviction that might make them more comfortable to watch.
Little did I know that the last words I would say on WNBC would be the last ones anyone would say.
Some liberals have a problem with me simply because I work at Fox, and nothing I do short of storming off the set in a rage will get them to respect that I work there.
I don't delude myself into thinking I'll bring anyone around to my way of thinking, especially Sean Hannity.
On my radio show at night, people will sometimes - conservatives will call and say, 'You know what, I'm really sorry I cast my vote for President Bush.' And we play Brenda Lee and 'I'm Sorry' and ask them to sing along.
