American,Model
We are what we see. We are products of our surroundings.
I don't really want to control anyone, to be honest.
Sometimes it feels like it hurts when you make a big purchase, so I really believe that the more expensive things should be gems that you keep in your closet, not trends.
Modeling isn't boring.
I am a kid. I'll always be a girl at heart.
It is in the mind and the heart where we meet. It's not the body-the body will change.
If you can be funny, it means you're intelligent. Your brain is working fast.
I've gotten out of bed a lot of days for a lot less than $10,000.
Art is for entertainment purposes, but it's also to reflect our dreams, our hopes, the present, the future the past - whether it's good or bad.
I do say no to things that I think are completely gratuitous.
I know that some of the spiritual beliefs that I have are that if I come from a place of love, and I try to get out of my ego and my desire to want more and be selfish in any shape or form, then whatever I'm doing is not good.
I'm not interested in making clothes that are not accessible.
