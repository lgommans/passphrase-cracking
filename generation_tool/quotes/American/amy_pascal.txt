Work will take everything you give it. It's up to you to work out what you want to give it.
It has been said that I make chick flicks. This is not a compliment.
You can't run a company simply by the numbers. So if you're going to bet on someone, you bet on someone you want to be in business with for a long time.
I love women. I've always cared about making movies about women my entire career.
I would have worked no matter what. I was born and raised that way. It occurred to me to be married second.
I didn't make 'The Sixth Sense' because I thought the ending wouldn't work!
I love to read things that I'm sure won't make a movie.
