American,Actress
I dress like a boy most of the time because I like what's comfortable, so sometimes when I have to wear dresses and makeup, it's kind of comedic. I take lots of pictures on my cell phone: 'Look, I'm dressed like a girl! Surprise!'
I'm a big music person. I compare a lot of my emotions to how something sounds.
My favorite band is probably The Cure. We can throw Talking Heads in there too, I listen to them a lot. But The Cure.
I'm not a fighter. If there's something going on that I really feel strongly about, I'll certainly stand up but I pick my battles.
I am not graceful.

I kind of do this awkward body language because, growing up, I had a really hard time expressing myself vocally.
The life of a working model in L.A. kind of sucks.
I went to USC for writing. I was judgmental of actors and their Starbucks and fancy cars.
To me, it's a little odd to ever think 'model into actor.' I modeled once. I was about as far from a decent model as you can possibly be. I did not enjoy the world at all. I fell in my stilettos quite a bit.
There's a lot of things I nerd out over. Quantum Mechanics. I also love Dungeons and Dragons. I want to be an astronaut.
I don't really believe in regret or mistakes. I try to take everything as it is, be comfortable with myself.
I moved to L.A. to write and direct. I had no intentions of being in front of the camera.
When you're acting, you're a person. When you're modeling, you're a hanger.
