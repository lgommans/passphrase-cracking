American,Public Servant
You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.
There is no world of absolute, complete privacy or a world of complete national security.
I have taken an oath already to the United States of America to protect and defend the Constitution. That is the only oath I will take.
