I was a solipsist and a narcissist and much too arrogant. I have a lot more compassion now, but it took a long time.
There's a part of me that looks beyond everything now.
I've always said to people that auteurism is nice, but it's hypothetical, and gradually you learn how much or how little influence different directors had.
I never argue with people about movies.
Movies are as old as psychoanalysis. So if I were to put you or anyone else on a couch and say, 'Tell me your favorite movies,' it would be a way of psychoanalyzing you.
