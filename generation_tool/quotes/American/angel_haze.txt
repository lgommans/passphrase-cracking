I can choose to be happy, or choose to be miserable every day - waiting until I die.
I have this desire to have this immaculate form of love that really doesn't exist, so my obsession goes on through life and I never find it and I end up miserable. But it makes me a better writer.
True artistic expression lies in conveying emotion.
Being honest with the public is how they respect you.
I put everyone in my school on to Nicki Minaj before she blew up. I was obsessed with her and I was like, 'If she's the best female rapper then I've got to be better than her.'
Living in New York, you get a lot of confidence; when I go back to Michigan, I realise how obnoxious and demanding and straightforward I am.
Guys pit female rappers against each other because female rappers - if you haven't noticed of late - are a lot more interesting than guys.
Love is boundary-less.
I can't really even name a person I like in hip-hop music.
I don't know, I feel like as time has gone on, hip-hop has become really redundant and repetitive.
I was going to go to school to become a neurological surgeon.
I want to be an artist you cannot categorize at all. You can't put a box around me. You can't put anything around me.
I think of religion as something that stains the person. It's a mindset you can never get free from, it's always in the back of your head.
I don't even really like rap music.
I love rock women.
There's a huge difference between who I am when I make music and who I am the rest of the time.
I love to listen to books on tape.
I like The Smiths - I would love to do a song with The Smiths, because they are so sonically different.
