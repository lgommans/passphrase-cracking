American,Actress
I've always been round, strong, and muscular.
Boy, if you dont have the network and the producers that believe in you, it's too, too much.
Down South, I never had to audition. They would call me up and give me a role.
I am not bold, lewd, or crude.
I am not sultry. I don't know what I am.
I just couldn't handle people coming on to me with motives other than music.
