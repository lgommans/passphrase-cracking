American,Poet
It doesn't matter who my father was; it matters who I remember he was.
Put your ear down close to your soul and listen hard.
Live or die, but don't poison everything.
Even without wars, life is dangerous.
The joy that isn't shared dies young.
In a dream you are never eighty.
I am not immortal. Faustus and I are the also-ran.
Saints have no moderation, nor do poets, just exuberance.
God owns heaven but He craves the earth.
God has a brown voice, as soft and full as beer.
Death's in the good-bye.
Need is not quite belief.
The beautiful feeling after writing a poem is on the whole better even than after sex, and that's saying a lot.
