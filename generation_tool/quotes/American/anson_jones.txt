American,Public Servant
It is only requisite, for me to say to you, that the President places great reliance upon your skill, judgment and intimate knowledge.
Unavoidable circumstances prevent me from giving you ample written instructions. Such however as may be deemed necessary will be prepared and sent to you at the City of Washington in a very few days.
The Republic of Texas is no more.
