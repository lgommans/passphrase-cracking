I think one year I was responsible for 163 screen deaths. That was a pretty good year for me, although it seems better than it actually was at a glance; 72 of those deaths were accounted for in one show.
I've never really been serious about my villainy. I don't have a master plan. I suppose my philosophy is: Every villain has a mother. For every cold-blooded killer on your screen, there's a little old lady somewhere who calls him 'sonny.'
Everybody wants to identify things about a poet or about a playwright. They want to codify something or put it in terms that can be understood. We want to understand something, because that's how our minds work. We like to understand things, and it's discomfiting if we don't understand things.
I really love being onstage - that's kind of home base - but I love the camera, too. I love it all.
I give talks to theater arts departments, and I don't know what I'll say. I don't plan a thing. It's just the energy of these young people. They're the next generation, and what they have is very representative of how I felt when I was 19 or 20 or so. I'm really happy to be with them.
