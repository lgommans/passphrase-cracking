American,Author
I am a gym rat who loves to work out, particularly running, Zumba, yoga, cycling, and kickboxing.
I love music, singing, and playing piano (though I'm not very good). And I adore musical theater.
Like most authors, I also love to read.
Before 'Wings' came out, I told a few people that at the end of book one, readers should think Laurel made the right choice. Then, at the end of 'Spells,' they should understand why Laurel made the choice she did.
At the end of 'Illusions,' readers should see the inevitable coming.
