Every great discovery I ever made, I gambled that the truth was there, and then I acted in faith until I could prove its existence.
It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is incontrovertible that where there is a plan there is intelligence - an orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered - 'In the beginning, God.'
