American,Musician
I love to have confidence, but that confidence doesn't come from myself. It comes from God, and that's what I wanted America to see.
I want to continue to do music and stay on the stage because I love the stage. And I want to continue to write songs.
I love inspirational R&B, like Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson. I want to do that. That kind of music stays with you.
Steven Tyler is awesome. He is so humble. He's really sweet and coming from him and his career, it's amazing.
I want to buy my mom a house; I want my family to never have to worry about anything. And I just want to have an amazing career in music, because I love to do it.
But I'm a big, firm believer in speaking everything into existence.
I believe that I'm going to have a Grammy.
I see myself continuing to be a songwriter and a motivator and someone that has grown in her faith.
I like to dress, I love to have make-up on, I like to do my hair.
