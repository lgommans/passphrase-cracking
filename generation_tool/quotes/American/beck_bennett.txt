Kids have a weird honesty, especially in their reaction to things where a lot of older people who have matured have lost that.
Working with children has done well for me. I don't find them intolerable or frustrating. They're just fun, full of energy, and happy to be there.
I would definitely like to start working with more people over age 7.
I redefined how I ate and exercised and have continued to keep that up because it feels great.
As an actor, a lot of things you do, people don't see it.
