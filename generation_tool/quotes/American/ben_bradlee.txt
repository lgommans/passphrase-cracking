You never monkey with the truth.
The champagne was flowing like the Potomac in flood.
Maybe some of today's papers have too many 'feel-good' features, but there is a lot of good news out there.
I give Cronkite a whole lot of credit.
I must be out of it, but I don't know any good journalists who have excused Clinton's problems.

I think he had a strange, passionate devotion to the truth and a horror at what he saw going on.
If an investigative reporter finds out that someone has been robbing the store, that may be 'gotcha' journalism, but it's also good journalism.
It took us about a day and a half to find out what had gone wrong.

We made only one real mistake. And even then we were right.
We were right about the slush fund. But Sloan did not testify about it to the Grand Jury.
