We came in today with a chip on our shoulder to prove who we are.
They scored 26 points in three quarters. That's solid defense.
The players have to come and play. Today we did.
The Finals are about a test of wills.
It's not tough at all as long as the fans are yelling, screaming and hollering.
I thought we were aggressive across the board defensively, and you could just see it grow. As the game went along, you could see the confidence grow. It showed in the fourth quarter.
I played in Joe Louis in a playoff game. I played there when the roof caved in for half a season. The facility is great for basketball because it goes straight up, so you feel like the fans are on top of you.
