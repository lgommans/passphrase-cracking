Baseball must be a great game to survive the fools who run it.
I had great control, I never missed hitting the other's fellow bat.
I played baseball because I could make more money doing that than I could doing anything else.
No business in the world has ever made more money with poorer management.
Hitting is business. With two strikes you really protect that plate.
