I've never heard of anybody smoking a joint and going on a rampage. It makes you lie around on the floor and look at the ceiling. What's wrong with that?
If you love somebody let them know every day.
Man, I was drowning in sadness. And Angelina, she lifted me right up out of there.
Getting the nomination is like gravy. Winning would be like whatever is better than gravy.
When people wear shoes that don't fit them, it says something about their soul. Generally, I think it means they are good people.
Tower Records is like a temple to me. I'll stay there for hours. Nobody can shop for records with me. It drives them out of their minds.
Movies these days have made killers into funny people. What's that all about? I've got kids and family and friends, and I don't like bad things. I don't think they're funny, and it's irresponsible to make movies that don't show you how that's not good.
Marketing is the devil.
Just the other day, my assistant was on the line with Calvin Klein. Golly, I usually shop at Sears.
I've danced one time in my life. It was the most mortifying experience I ever had.
I was the fattest baby in Clark County, Arkansas. They put me in the newspaper. It was like a prize turnip.
I quit flying years ago. I don't want to die with tourists.
I don't have a fear of flying; I have a fear of crashing.
I believe in running through the rain and crashing into the person you love and having your lips bleed on each other.
Every couple I know has side-by-side grave plots, but when we do it we're the biggest weirdos on the block.
Acting is playing - it's actually going out on a playground with the other kids and being in the game, and I need that. Writing satisfies that part of myself that longs to sit in my room and dream.
