You never get fans hanging out on movie sets. It just never happens.
I am not a big reader to begin with.
Actually shooting a 3-D movie is not different at all than making a 2-D one. You never really notice that you're making a 3-D movie. The terminology used around the set is a little bit different, but other than that, you'd never know.
I'm not an extremely prolific writer. I don't write songs all the time.
The end of times has always been a fascination. But post 9/11, pretty much everybody will admit to having it on their minds more frequently than when they were a kid.
You can't stop technology or science, and it is snowballing quicker than ever. Something's got to come to a head. How? Who knows? But it will.
I've never had a series that's gone past 12 episodes.
I'm not a guy who has ever seen the inside of a gym.
I watch movies, and if I get the chance to watch television, I'm usually prone to watching something completely mindless and mundane that I don't have to follow so closely.
I had known that I'd wanted to be an actor from a very early age, but I had always known that I wanted to have a dual career. I wanted to be an actor, and I also at that time wanted to be a rock star.
I've gotten an opportunity to work with a lot of the people I've looked up to over the years, and I feel pretty grateful for it.
We are so reliant on power and technology for everything.
I can do without a television or a telephone, I think.
