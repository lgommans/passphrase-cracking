I really love the togetherness in baseball. That's a real true love.
Everything looks nicer when you win. The girls are prettier. The cigars taste better. The trees are greener.
What I miss when I'm away is the pride in baseball. Especially the pride of being on a team that wins.
I may not have been the best Yankee to put on the pinstripes, but I am the proudest.
There's nothing greater in the world than when somebody on the team does something good, and everybody gathers around to pat him on the back.
Most people miss the great part mental outlook plays in this game.
