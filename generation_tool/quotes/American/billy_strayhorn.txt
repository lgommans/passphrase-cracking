I'll live a lush life in some small dive.
You're in a mess, and in excess.
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive.
My grandmother played the piano, and I used to toddle over there and pick out little things that sounded good to me.

In order to play and write, it's unique - you either do one or the other.

I'm not fit company for man or beast.
I think everything should happen at halfway to dawn. That's when all the heads of government should meet. I think everybody would fall in love.
Ever up and onward.
All music is beautiful.
