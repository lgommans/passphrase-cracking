American,Politician
The federal government has a responsibility to protect all Americans from potential terrorist attack.
Public office is supposed to be a public trust. This is a clear sign of the rampant corruption at the highest levels of the Republican leadership.
Throughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina, I have always tried to treat people from all viewpoints with respect.
I have and I will always work to promote a civil public discourse.
