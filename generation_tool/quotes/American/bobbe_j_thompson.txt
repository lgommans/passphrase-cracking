American,Actor
I'm in the eighth grade and am not the height of the rest of my class. But I don't worry about that. I'm just me!
I'm just a sweet little kid.
I'm blessed, and I say it all the time that I don't take anything for granted. I studied my craft and just stick with it.
I'm looking to do an action film where I can run with my shirt off and a gun in my hand; and do like a 'Taken' role and get up on one knee and kill the bad guy.
I was the class clown type of guy.
