One moment I can be happy and laughing, but then it comes over me. It's my mom.
No one knows what an amazing spirit she was. She wasn't only a mother; she was a best friend.
Of course we had our arguments; we had everything, but at the end of the day, that was still my mother, my confidante - my everything.
Everything people are saying about her - all that negativity - it's garbage. That's not my mother.
