The sun shines everywhere, not just at the beach.
I always wear SPF 30 sunscreen under my make-up, and I also wear a hat because taking care of my skin is important to me.
I'll take being on Baywatch over being Prom Queen any day.
I mean if someone you know pushes a button you're gonna strike back out.
You know I'm proud of all of them but I think that I am most proud of all my businesses and just being a business woman and being able to do that as well as you know hold my career as an actress.
There's a reason why Hasselhoff was in a suit for twelve years, and there's a reason why Donald still has his hair that way. I'm tellin' ya. They're both sexy.
You still should enjoy the beach and going outside. Having a good time at the beach can still include being smart about protecting your skin because getting burned is no fun at all.
The challenges surrounding HIV and AIDS are getting more complex and mature, and we just can't stick our heads in the sand and say 'it can't happen to me.'
That's why I wanted to be part of this AIDS Project Los Angeles party. We help raise funds for those who are having a tough time with some very basic necessities, like shelter, food, and medical care.
It's important not to lose sight of the fact people of all sorts are still putting themselves at risk. It happens to straight and gay, single and married. I have never been comfortable thinking of AIDS as something that 'other people' get.
Because we are all human beings, we are all HIV-eligible.
