I can take more pain than anyone.
I can look up in the air and see where the wind is gonna change direction.
When you put a camera in front of me, I'm home.
I always had two or three jobs at the same time. I started doing yard work when I was 7 or 8. When I was 13, I got my first state job doing road construction. Between working, sports and school, I hardly ever had free time.
Even Spartacus needs a coach.
I was not put here to be a background character in someone else's movie!
Dude, I throw a stick. Come on. I get paid a pretty good salary to throw a stick.
Hey, man, I toss a stick for a living. Gotta spice up that deal, y'know. Gotta stand out.
I could always throw stuff, starting with tantrums.
Don't get me wrong. I want people to know who I am.
