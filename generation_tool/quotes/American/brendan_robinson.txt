There's a behind-the-scenes show that Oprah is doing that follows the final season of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.' I find behind-the-scenes stuff fascinating. Like, whenever I watch a DVD, I always watch the special features and listen to the commentary first, before I even watch the movie.
I get a lot of comments from people that I remind them of a young Tom Hanks.
I love sweets. I have a tendency to go out at, like, 11 P.M. and get a giant piece of cake because I'm craving it. The problem is if you eat a big piece of cake that late, you wake up in the morning feeling really sick.
I don't carry cash often. I'm all about the plastic.
I'm not a huge scary movie kind of guy; like, I don't do slasher movies, because I'm really squeamish. But if I had to pick a favorite, it would definitely be 'The Shining' with Jack Nicholson. Not only is that a scary movie, it's just a flat out classic.
