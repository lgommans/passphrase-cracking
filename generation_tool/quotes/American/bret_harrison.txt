American,Actor
My relationship with Christian Slater is like him and Marisa Tomei in 'Untamed Heart.' 'True Romance' was right when I was beginning to become a fan boy of movies. People forget that he's worked with some of the biggest directors in Hollywood. He's worked with Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino, John Woo.
I'm very open to constructive criticism.
If you're an actor, if you're not writing as well, or you're not going to improv classes, there are long spurts where you're not physically in production - unless you're Channing Tatum at this moment right now - where you need to be doing something.
I feel like I have the best job in the world.
