American,Actor
I don't think I could compare myself to Macaulay Culkin, because we're pretty much two different kinds of actors. He's done a lot of comedy. He does mostly just comedy like 'Uncle Buck' and 'Home Alone' and 'Home Alone 2.' And I've done a lot of different stuff, like sad movies, like the movie about the kid with AIDS.
Music is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
It's not annoying if only a couple of people come up. If a bunch of them crowd around me, it's annoying.
