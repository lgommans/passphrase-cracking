I think competition is very important; it breeds many good things in a person.
I enjoyed being involved in team sports and making close friendships.
I've been playing since I was eight years old.
It really came down to deciding between baseball and soccer. Soccer won out because I enjoyed it more.
Competition helps people figure it out.
Basically I say a few prayers before a game and let that direct me, not superstitions.
You prepare yourself by concentrating on what you have to do out on the field.
My goals are for the U.S. team to get to the second round of the World Cup and to win a championship here in the U.S. with my club team the Columbus Crew.
Keep enjoying it, and if you do that, then you are going to get better.
Put your head down and work as hard as you can because there is always someone better out there.
I grew up in a great family.
It's not any one person. It's not any one coach. It's the team.
I want to be involved in soccer some way.
