We love our business. We have never been more enthusiastic about cable and its future.
We did some soul-searching. Was the cable industry obsolete? Was it an opportune time to get out? Our conclusion was that if you rebuilt your system with this new fiber-optic coaxial hybrid - which we now call broadband - the glass was half full, not half empty. We could compete.
The day is coming when, in 45 seconds, you can download a movie.
I think cable has been under-appreciated for its contribution to society.
NBC News will help define Comcast.
Today NBC makes certain content available online and I can't imagine we will change that process.
