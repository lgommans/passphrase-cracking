I love creating characters and becoming someone else entirely.
I had a very close relationship with my grandmother. She actually helped raise me.
I am so lucky to have the job that I have. I can never lose sight of the fact that people are counting on me to do my best.
The most emotionally connected I've ever been to a character is Natsuki in 'Summer Wars.'
