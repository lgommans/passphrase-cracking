I'm anxious about losing anonymity.
They got rid of bottled water. We got thermoses that say 'Grey's Anatomy Season 4' with our names on it. Cool.
You know, I don't watch television! Sorry! I actually don't even have a television. I don't, I really don't. It's nuts, but it's true.
I remember seeing 'A Moon for the Misbegotten' with Colleen Dewhurst, and that made a really big impression on me, and I remember wanting to be like her and I still want to be like Colleen Dewhurst! My mom took me to a lot of theatre growing up, and I also remember seeing Pippin and being like, 'Wow!
My child has changed things for me. Lately, I really wish there were greater roles for women. I think I see it in a different way now. I look at my little girl and I don't want her to think that all she has to be is pretty and quiet.
I feel like I am always battling to keep my weight down.
