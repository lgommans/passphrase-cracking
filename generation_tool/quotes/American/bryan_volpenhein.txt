I think I have experience in rowing, and that has given me some ability to go about racing. I'm lucky genetically. I have a good VO2 max - I can hold a lot of air in my lungs - and that definitely helps.
There's way more pressure cooking for cooks than rowing at the Olympics.
In rowing, you're always striving for that perfect stroke, that repetition, each one being as good as the last. Same thing with cooking. You can't say, 'Oh, I don't feel well, so I'm going to put out a crappy plate.'
I'm not disappointed with bronze. It's always good to come away with a medal.
Right now my favorite book is 'Omnivores Dilemma.'
I'm very competitive, but I know when not to be competitive. I know how to have fun, but I know when it's time to get serious. That makes things a lot easier.
Without something I'm really excited about... I'd be really lost.
Surfing - I have to go surfing.
I borrowed a lot of money from my parents in the years leading up to the 2000 Olympics, and I worked odd jobs.
