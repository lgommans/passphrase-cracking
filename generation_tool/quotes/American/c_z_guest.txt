I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend.
I like the classic look. Keep it simple. There's only so much you can wear.
What I don't understand is these people who go on the street wearing riding clothes, and they have never been on a horse. They ought to have their heads examined, really. It's a joke. But, let's face it, we live in a fantasy world.
All the girls today want to be famous, but they haven't earned their spurs.
The most important thing is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.
I call myself, 'The Estee Lauder of the garden world.' I'm my own little conglomerate.
