American,Soldier
When I joined Custer I donned the uniform of a soldier. It was a bit awkward at first but I soon got to be perfectly at home in men's clothes.
It was considered the most dangerous route in the Hills, but as my reputation as a rider and quick shot was well known, I was molested very little, for the toll gatherers looked on me as being a good fellow, and they knew that I never missed my mark.
While in El Paso, I met Mr. Clinton Burk, a native of Texas, who I married in August 1885.
On October 28th, 1887, I became the mother of a girl baby, the very image of its father, at least that is what he said, but who has the temper of its mother.
By the time we reached Virginia City I was considered a remarkable good shot and a fearless rider for a girl of my age.
I left Montana in Spring of 1866, for Utah, arriving at Salt Lake city during the summer.
We were ordered out to quell an uprising of the Indians, and were out for several days, had numerous skirmishes during which six of the soldiers were killed and several severely wounded.
As many of the riders before me had been held up and robbed of their packages, mail and money that they carried, for that was the only means of getting mail and money between these points.
I was in Deadwood at the time and on hearing of the killing made my way at once to the scene of the shooting and found that my friend had been killed by McCall.
During the fall and winter we built Fort Meade and the town of Sturgis.
Left the ranch in 1883, went to California, going through the States and territories, reached Ogden the latter part of 1883, and San Francisco in 1884.
We remained in Texas leading a quiet home life until 1889.
