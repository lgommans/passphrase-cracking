American,Actor
I came to the industry with wide eyes and an open heart thinking I was going to make a few films that really meant something that I could pour myself into.
I'm ready to be an action figure. I'd love that very much. And all the redheaded kids will get to go out and feel loved and be able to buy a redheaded action figure.
Well, I'm a Texas boy, and we have denim in our blood.
I usually listen to classic rock and roll.
I have been acting since I was thirteen.
I began with small roles in successful movies like 'No Country For Old Men' by the Coen brothers; but it was 'The Last Exorcism' that changed my life: with what I earned, I left Texas and moved to Los Angeles.
Actors are always the last to see what they have created.
Writing songs is an essential part of my life: my mother teaches piano, and I have inherited my grandparents' passion for music, especially from my grandfather Tommy, who was a great drummer. It's no coincidence that I play the drums best, but I am also good with the guitar and the piano.
You don't want to meet anybody in Cannes. It's the worst place, I think, to meet somebody - one of the worst places.
As an actor, you pay attention very closely to everything that happens to you, and you're constantly watching others as well, trying to just find out where everything comes from.
I don't know if I'm a method actor.
