American,Writer
I'm one of the lucky writers: plots come easily to me.
I wrote eight full-length adult novels in my twenties. None of them were published.
I approach serious subjects, and I like to have the good guys win and have the parents among the good guys.
I love all of it, thinking up the plots, getting to know the kids in the story, their parents, backyards, pizza toppings.
I believe my readers are crazy about their parents and want to be just like them when they grow up.
I believe my voice is pretty much the same. I've written 75 books, so I'm better at it now than I was earlier in my career.
I love writing and do not know why it is considered such a difficult, agonizing profession.
Actually my first eight books were historical novels, but they were never published.
I decided to write short stories because they got rejected quicker.
My favorite book is always the one I'm working on at the moment.
I get letters from readers who say that they have always hated reading, but somebody suggested one of my books, they actually finished the book and enjoyed it, and they're going on to read another book. I'm thrilled that they have figured out that reading is fun.
People nearly always believe, and are willing to back it up with weapons and cruelty, that their religion and way of life is better than the other person's.
If you write a story based on a real person, you're trapped by the details of the real person and his life. It gets in the way of writing your own story.
