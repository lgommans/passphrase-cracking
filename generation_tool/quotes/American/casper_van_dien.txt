American,Actor
I do most of my own stunts because the stunt guys show me how.
I eat really healthy, and if I'm tired, I take a nap.
Green is my favorite. And it's my favorite because it's the color of my wife's eyes, grass, trees, life, and money, and mother earth!
And I ride horses, swim, do a lot of reading, writing.
I, more or less, love camping out, so I dug it, but I didn't enjoy other people's pain.
In Tarzan I only had to worry about the bees.
Tim Burton... as an actor you wait and wish and hope and pray you'll work with him.
I get beat up on every project.
I like the way that different people recognise me for the roles I done.
It would be Spiderman. I'd love to be Peter Parker.
I play a huge variety of roles.
I've always loved writing.
We make a lot of mistakes for women, and we'll always do it again.
I sail, scuba dive, play football, basketball.
As for action movies, I did Tarzan, and I'm also about to shoot Meltdown, which John Carpenter wrote.
The one in the movie is not real, but my Casper tattoo is real, and it is my only one.
I already played James Dean in a film called Race with Destiny, but it hasn't come out yet.
I bounce off four walls, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because I only sleep those four hours a day.
I don't drink. I don't do drugs.
I'd like to continue to act and also produce.
I do really crazy things all the time, but I can't think of anything offhand.
Being a working actor, you're going to do a Spelling show. It's hard not to.
Oh, I wouldn't want to go on a date with a female celebrity. I'd rather go on a date with a real woman.
I like movies that challenge people to recognize different things.
Growing up, my favorite TV show was Star Trek.
I also watched a lot of football and sports. I haven't had much time to watch too much TV lately.
