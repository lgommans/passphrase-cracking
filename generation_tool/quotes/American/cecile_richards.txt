Nearly 100 years ago, when Planned Parenthood was founded, birth control was illegal.
And because of President Obama, more women than ever are serving in the Cabinet and on the Supreme Court.
Thanks to President Obama, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition!
So why are we having to fight in 2012 against politicians who want to end access to birth control? It's like we woke up in a bad episode of 'Mad Men.'
President Obama understands women. He trusts women. And on every issue that matters to us, he stands with women.
