I believe in work, hard work, and long hours of work. Men do not breakdown from overwork, but from worry and dissipation.
Men do not die from overwork. They die from dissipation and worry.
The United States is the greatest law factory the world has ever known.
Publicity is a great purifier because it sets in action the forces of public opinion, and in this country public opinion controls the courses of the nation.
The power to wage war is the power to wage war successfully.
War should be made a crime, and those who instigate it should be punished as criminals.
In a number of cases dissenting opinions have in time become the law.
The first lesson in civics is that efficient government begins at home.
Dissents are appeals to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of another day.
While democracy must have its organization and controls, its vital breath is individual liberty.
When we deal with questions relating to principles of law and their applications, we do not suddenly rise into a stratosphere of icy certainty.
