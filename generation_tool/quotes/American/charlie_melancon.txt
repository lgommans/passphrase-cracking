American,Politician
When you are pulling people out of the water and off of rooftops, there are no Republicans and no Democrats.
I'm a pro-life, pro-gun Louisiana Democrat.
I think too many of the politicians in Washington have forgotten simple ideals like solving problems and helping neighbors. The Washington game is more about scoring points or sticking it to the other guy.
I'm a proud fighter for the little guy and the people of my state who are struggling to make ends meet. That's what Louisiana values are about.
I don't represent corporations.
