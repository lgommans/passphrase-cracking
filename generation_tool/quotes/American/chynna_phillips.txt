American,Musician
I always tell my kids make your vocation your vacation.
A psychic once read my palm and told me I was my mother's mother in a past life. Isn't that weird?
I've always been down-to-earth about money.
I've got the Lord on board.
Nothing is more gratifying as a Christian believer than being able to thread my faith and love for Jesus into my music.
I've got so many blessings in my life.
