American,Actor
I would walk into an audition, and they'd say, 'Here comes Clinton Derricks-Carroll's brother.' They could never remember my name.
When I do comedy, it's not like I'm trying to be funny for folks; I look for the honesty in it. With James Early in 'Dreamgirls,' it was the honesty of it: it was the reality of the moment. You know, I don't know what makes me play sometimes. I really don't. I just do what I do. And that's what I did for 'Sliders,' and that's how I got the job.
When you have an opportunity to do a series, you want to stick it out. You don't know when you're going to get another one like that again.
