You don't burn out from going too fast. You burn out from going too slow and getting bored.
Just keep going like crazy and look back when it's over. Otherwise you just get confused.
Control your life through insanity.
Why should we change onstage? We're not trying to be something big and fancy, it's just us, doing what we do, we'd like to keep it that way.
Every once in awhile we may fall on our face, but we insist on doing what we wanna do.
Personally, I would say the 'master' of this whole thing is fate... Whoever is on the playing field is fair game, and it's up to them to avoid being used.
As a kid, I said, 'I want to write for movies.' When I finally had that opportunity it was like I was able to exhale. 'Wow, I'm finally doing this for real.'
To live is to die.
We do what we want. We don't care what anyone else thinks.
