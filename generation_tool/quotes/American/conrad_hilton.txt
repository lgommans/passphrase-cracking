The practice of charity will bind us - will bind all men in one great brotherhood.
Be ever watchful for the opportunity to shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity; be generous to their schools, their hospitals, and their places of worship. For, as they must bear the burdens of our mistakes, so are they in their innocence the repositories of our hopes for the upward progress of humanity.
Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed onto mankind.
Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit.
The buyer is entitled to a bargain. The seller is entitled to a profit. So there is a fine margin in between where the price is right. I have found this to be true to this day whether dealing in paper hats, winter underwear or hotels.
My new hotels will play a leading role in promoting world peace.
I think intuition can be a form of answered prayer. You do the best you can - thinking, figuring, planning - and then you pray.
