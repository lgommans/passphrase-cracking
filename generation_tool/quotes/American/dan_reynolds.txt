American,Musician
There was nothing more I wanted to do than to see my dad react well to my music. I still do. I send him my demos all the time.
I wouldn't recommend being a musician to anyone. It's not glamorous. It's a lot of being dirty, not eating, playing for five people and one of them is the bartender.
But I really believe that you don't do music because you want to, you do it because you have to.
I always like to leave art and music open to interpretation.
There is always a mix of apprehension and excitement before you try songs out on a new audience.
My dad is my biggest source of inspiration. He's a lawyer, and when he'd get home, we always sat down and listened to music.
I always would dream of making music videos. Whenever I make music, I always have a visual in my mind. I always see things.
