American,Actor
After 'Brothers & Sisters' ended, I was back to the old game as an actor. Doing pilot season, choosing a script and figuring out what I wanted to do.
I always loved television. I always loved movies.
Michael J. Fox was my idol. I always wanted to be Michael J. Fox.
Hollywood is full of beautiful people - but who knows how many are beautiful inside?
I liked watching myself on TV. My first job was hosting the 'Roommate Game'.
