I think my first big purchase was actually for my mom. She had one of those '90s TVs in her living room that's like a 10x10 brick, so I purchased her a flatscreen for her living room.
For example, for me, my brother helped me get a manager, which I don't take for granted. It's tough getting a manager, let alone one that actually cares about you and is smart. But from there, no one's going to cast me just because I'm James Franco's little brother.
To be honest, I was kind of a shy kid growing up.
I don't just wanna be James Franco's little brother.
At this point, I feel like I can allow myself to be goofy and take more risks, and even if I do fall on my face, I know it's not the end of the world and at least I tried to do something different.
I'm a tough critic on myself.
I'm not one of those people who are, like, always joking in person.
As much as I love and respect my brother, I'm doing my best to distance myself from him and kind of show people that, even though we do look similar and have similar mannerisms, we are completely different.
When I think of myself, I'm definitely... I'm not like a comedian.
I'm a cat person.
I'm a small shifty kind of guy.
I can't say I was like a die-hard zombie fan, but I've definitely seen a few different zombie movies and TV shows.
I just know that it's smart for my career to carve my own path and do my own thing.
