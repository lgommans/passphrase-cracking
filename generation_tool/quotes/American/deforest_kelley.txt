American,Actor
The most important influence in my childhood was my father.
I ran around with the other youngsters, hunting, fishing and raising tadpoles and all the rest.
You see, I was the son of a baptist minister.
I have been exposed to a great amount of temptation throughout the course of my career.
My father started me singing in church.
It was a perfectly average well- adjusted childhood, not a bit unlike that of millions of other individuals.
I had fallen in love with California.
I have deep feelings for the welfare and comfort of others.
I refuse to be crude and selfish in any way.
I have considered myself a mature actor.
My ambition is peace and perfection.
I am still seeking to become firmly established as an actor.
I have no aspiration whatsoever to be the next great leading man.
Star Trek has brought so much of what I want within my grasp.
What I truly miss the most is having sufficient time to do all the things that need to be done around the house and for our friends.
I m up at 5 in the morning and in bed by 10 in the evening.
Star Trek is perhaps the best thing that ever happened to me, in a career sense.
I once aged 90 years old in one episode.
