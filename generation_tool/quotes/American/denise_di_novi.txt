If you're lucky enough to experience love, what you find is that it can sustain you through the most difficult times.
The movie business can be very frustrating and very circuitous; there's no straight path. You have to have tremendous perseverance, dedication and passion. You have to want it very, very badly and you have to deal with a lot of rejection.
I thought, 'I loved Batman, I loved Spider-Man, I love all these characters, but Catwoman is really different from any other one.'
One common desire that every human being has is to love and be loved. At the end of our lives, it's how we measure our lives.
I find 'Edward Scissorhands' a very inspiring movie - it's one of the first movies about bullying, in a way - about being treated unkindly for being different.
