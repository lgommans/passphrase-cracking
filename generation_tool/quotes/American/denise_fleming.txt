I try to picture my books being acted out.
Picture books are the distillation of an idea, and you have to use just the right words. I love that, and I try to use a lot of action verbs.
Very seldom do I use white in my books.
If your child really loves art, get them some good brushes. Get good material and make them feel that what they do is important.
