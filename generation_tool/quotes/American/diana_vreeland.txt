Blue jeans are the most beautiful things since the gondola.
Elegance is innate. It has nothing to do with being well dressed. Elegance is refusal.
I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.
The only real elegance is in the mind; if you've got that, the rest really comes from it.
The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.
In a Balenciaga you were the only woman in the room - no other woman existed.
Pink is the navy blue of India.
What do I think about the way most people dress? Most people are not something one thinks about.
I always wear my sweater back-to-front; it is so much more flattering.
No one cuts backs like he did. No one knows what a back is anymore.
Balenciaga did the most delicious evening clothes. Clothes aren't delicious any more.
Poor, darling fellow - he died of food. He was killed by the dinner table.
Parents, you know, can be terrible.
Red is the great clarifier - bright and revealing. I can't imagine becoming bored with red - it would be like becoming bored with the person you love.
The body must stay fit. Fit people like themselves much better.
You don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive.
Exaggeration is my only reality.
