Well, the rollout of new technology always affects how wizards do business.
What I try to do for my readers is to pass on some of the things that I found out about being thirteen after doing it for forty years.
What teens will realize is always a mystery to me. I'm still realizing so many things myself, very belatedly, that it seems unwise to think I have any right to be showing people things in hopes that they'll realize them.
My first generation of young readers now have not only children, but some of them have grandchildren to whom they're introducing their old passion.
I may have one more 'Star Trek' novel in me, but it would be in the old universe, not the new one.
