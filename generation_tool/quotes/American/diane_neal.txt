My older sister has all her degrees in theater, and I couldn't stand the theater geeks!
I never get to be funny on T.V.
I've been a stand-up comedian for years, and I can be silly.
Legal dialogue is awesome, but you can't ad lib. It's much more fun to be looser and say things like, 'Can I work in a Han Solo reference?' I'm a 'Star Wars' freak.
The vast majority of A.D.A.s put everything on the line to make sure justice is served. That's what I love about prosecutors and the New York police.
