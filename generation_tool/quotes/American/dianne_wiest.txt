American,Actress
It was just this crazy craziness, and the fact that it was shot in Paris, and it had these incredible people in it. It was an easy thing to say yes to.
Unless you are unique, your opinion goes out the window.
I had to choose, I'd be so sad. They are flip sides of the same coin. I love both comedy and drama.
Sweet things happen. They still do.
What I love is a peanut butter and pickle sandwich. I'll just have peanut butter and bananas, then peanut butter and pickles. Peanut butter and chocolate I don't recommend.
Directors say that you should get actors before they are recognized. They will be a pain or have an opinion.
I failed to fulfill what should have been an interesting role. I couldn't take their formula and bring what I had, my humor, my ideas, and make it my own.
I look at the kids coming out of Yale. They are so intelligent with their careers. I wish I had that.
I recently turned down a film that I didn't want my kids to see. Priorities shift. Sometimes I'm sad about that, but not enough to do anything about it.
I shot Footloose nearby, and we used to hike. Very fond memories.
I used to watch dailies and felt I had to keep on top of the character, but I don't feel that any more.
I'm more aware of time. The element of time.
I've been grateful for what comes along.
The formula is the star. I couldn't work inside that formula.
The studios are very much business. Maybe it was always that way. It is really commercial now. Judgments are made and directions are given to make the cash register ring.
Theater is not to make a living, so I don't have the money pressure.
Woody is so musical in his filmmaking. I've never worked with anyone I've trusted so completely. He won't let you hit a false note.
You are at the mercies of the dailies. With an indie you don't have that.
Young people are more intelligent and sophisticated.
