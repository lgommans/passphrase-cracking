American
If my kids want to have fries, you know what, I'm gonna let my kids have fries. If they are active and if they're moving, there's nothing wrong with having some fries.
Burgers and fries are an American staple. On the same token, my kids eat vegetables, and they always have eaten vegetables. They didn't have a choice but to eat vegetables.
