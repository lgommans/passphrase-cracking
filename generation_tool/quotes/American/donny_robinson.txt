I haven't accepted anyone telling me what is or isn't possible and have just kept moving along toward my goals.
I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.
From the time I was six years old, I wanted to be a BMX Racer and be the best.
I believe BMX has shaped me into who I am today, so if this journey never would have begun, then who knows the person I would be or what I would be doing with my life.
I always travel with my bike and it has become a little more difficult to do it nowadays, but I stick it in 3,5 by 6-foot case and wheel that thing in.
BMX is kind of a big guy sport, you know.
I don't have the ideal body type for BMX, but just with anything, you have your pros and your cons. And being small kind of allows me to maneuver through the other bigger riders and make passes they couldn't necessarily make.
