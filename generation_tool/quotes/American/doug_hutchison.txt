American,Actor
I think being in love with life is a key to eternal youth.
Life is unpredictable and you need to live every day to the fullest.
I'm young in spirit and have lots of energy.
I believe there's one rule in Hollywood, and that's that there are no rules.
I usually don't find myself reacting to my characters. I just create them ... And let the audience decide whether they're empathetic or scared or compelled to cheer me on.
Whenever I have time and am compelled to watch anything, it's usually something I'm not in!
