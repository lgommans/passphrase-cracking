Use plants to bring life.
Yeah, I spent about 20 years in a dorm room. It took me a while to graduate.
I look at each episode in two ways - from a design standpoint and from an entertainment standpoint - this is TV, after all. We usually succeed on at least one of the levels.
There are lighter colors of granite and I like to break the rules.
I see the same coffee table everywhere. It's mass marketing.
Whether it was working on theatre sets or stage lighting, I didn't realize most all of the skills I was exposed to were going to come in handy later on when I became a designer.
It's a character I've created. Actually, that's pretty much the opposite of me, off a farm in the Midwest.

I was supposed to be the antithesis of Frank.
I am the young, edgy New Yorker.
I'm opinionated. I always stick to my design plan. I don't waver.

I enjoy talking to fans.
Throughout the country, I see the same design problems and solutions over and over.
I gave the couple a hint of a design that would work great with the bones of their home. They weren't ready for it, and they embarrassed themselves and that's too bad.

I've made an incredible amount of money stealing fans from homeowners.
I'm very flattered, but I don't think I'm the sexiest man on the planet.
I know people don't think I work.
I'm having the time of my life and I'm glad people are enjoy it.
Being in the design industry, I've tended to meet more people who are affected by HIV and AIDS.
There is no such thing as a guilty pleasure.
Why stress tomorrow when you can stress today?
