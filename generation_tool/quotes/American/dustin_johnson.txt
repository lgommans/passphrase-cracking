With me, what you see is what you get. I try to treat everyone with respect.
Anytime you're playing a major, the last four or five holes, it's not going to be easy. It's never a guarantee. It's never easy.
I'm pretty close with a lot of guys, like Nick Watney and Steve Marino, D.J. Trahan and Charlie Warren.
I sign autographs and try to be as nice to people as possible, and I do pretty well with that. I understand the importance of it.
Most of my family are good athletes.
I love being on the water, wakesurfing and wakeboarding. I'm not thinking about golf. I'm just wondering if my cooler's got enough ice to make it through the day.
I always knew I wanted to play golf and go to college. I try hard to be a positive role model, especially on the golf course. I try to carry myself well, and don't do anything outrageous. I try to play the game like a gentleman and give everyone respect. That's how the game should be played.
As a kid, I remember John Daly bombing it around St. Andrews in 1995 to win the British Open, and people say we are similar in a lot of ways.
At Pebble Beach, even on your good shots, you've got to hit it to the correct side of the holes to save pars.
Golf is a weird sport. Some days you got it. Some days you don't.
Telling me that I can't do something is probably the worst thing that anyone can say, because I'll definitely do it. I'm very determined.
