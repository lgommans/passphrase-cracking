Everyone's like sheep on social media; like, one person starts making noise, and everyone's like, 'Hey, yeah!' and then you got a whole bunch of people making noise at you.
At the end of the day, I'm not some evil guy.
At first, I was just trying to sound like DOOM and Eminem, and then I dug out my own voice, I guess.
Twitter is a real addiction, like the color of it, the process of it.
Rapping is the only time I'm serious.
Sometimes videos make a bad song very tight.
Odd Future's like a network as opposed to like a rap group.
My friends have to remind me that it's OK to own the fact that you're good at something. I think it'll just come with getting older.
It just happens to be that people like to associate poetry and rap music. I think that idea is kind of corny.
I think rap music is rap music. I mean, are there heavy writing aspects of it? Absolutely. In a sense, is it poetry? Yeah. I've heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry. But I think people like to use that as a shortcut for who's good and who's not. It's like the word 'lyrical' - 'lyrical' is the worst word in the entire world.
It would be ridiculous to say I don't want to sell records, but I trust my taste.
It takes me a long time to write, and I trust myself, so I write very sparsely, so when I do, I know it's good, you know what I mean? Rather than writing a whole bunch and having to sort out what's good and what's not.
All rappers are princesses like me.
People think artists like 50 Cent don't have charisma, but it's just a different kind of charisma, a bully charisma, which is kinda frowned upon.
Lil B opened up the floodgates for Odd Future, and now rap has a huge Internet culture.
Whatever I think the song sounds like is what I'll name it. It's a feeling thing; it's not logical at all.
