American,Actress
I remember the general anxiety of teenager, and I remember establishing some sort of appearance based on what my peers would think. And cliques, oh my God, the worst. The worst!
I have some sarcastic sides of me.
The hair department is always on my case about washing my hair. I am incredibly lazy, and a brat about washing my hair.
I live in a constant state of hyperbole.
I mostly like to travel and volunteer because I get antsy if I stay in my comfort zone for too long.
I would love to be able to see as much of the world as possible, and volunteering, doing things in another community, living with a host family, are really effective ways to learn about cultures different from your own. And also to not feel lazy.
I am the middle child with an older and younger brother.
I don't realize how rare it is to genuinely have sincere love for everyone you work with. Especially in Hollywood, but even in life.
I went to public school my whole life. It was a performing arts school, so I can't say if it was a typical experience or not, because it's all I know.
I never want to sound preachy about youth and feminism, but I feel like there aren't enough young people coming out about their concerns and opinions.
I feel very strongly that young women have regressed a little bit. But I do get all preachy about it.
On Christmas, my family and I see a movie and go out for Chinese food. We don't celebrate Christmas in the traditional sense, in that we do not actually celebrate Christmas.
I love the holidays on 'The Middle' because I feel like I'm getting that very traditional American holiday experience that I never had growing up.
Someone was asking me what my favorite outfit is, and 100%, without a doubt in my mind, is my forever lazy.
I love oral hygiene.
I went to a Katy Perry concert, and I experienced pure bliss for the first time in my life.
I have had just an excess of energy. That's why I've always been active.
