If you say you're going to do something, you better damn well do it.
My back's not big enough for the number of targets on it.
When I got injured, I think I was starting to sense that there was more to the world than just sports. This dream of playing professional soccer probably wasn't the best track for me.
I support gun safety measures, and I'll tell you, I grew up in a family of gun owners and hunters, and I went hunting with my dad as a kid, and you know, I have deep respect for the Second Amendment and the culture of our country.
I support an assault weapons ban, and I'll tell you why. We already have one in California, so I don't support doing anything above what we do in California.
I think having a national system that tracks who owns guns is fine. I don't think we need to be printing it on the Internet.
My position has always been that the House of Representatives does not take reservations. It's walk-in only.
The power of incumbency cannot be underestimated.
One of my goals here in Congress, being the youngest member of the California delegation, is to really try and get the institution to upgrade the way it communicates with its constituents.
