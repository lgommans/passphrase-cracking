I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Nobody's free until everybody's free.
If the white man gives you anything - just remember when he gets ready he will take it right back. We have to take for ourselves.
People have got to get together and work together. I'm tired of the kind of oppression that white people have inflicted on us and are still trying to inflict.
There is one thing you have got to learn about our movement. Three people are better than no people.
White Americans today don't know what in the world to do because when they put us behind them, that's where they made their mistake... they put us behind them, and we watched every move they made.
With the people, for the people, by the people. I crack up when I hear it; I say, with the handful, for the handful, by the handful, cause that's what really happens.
