American,Actress
I actually got started in acting when I was in pre-school. I was really into dance and performing, so my mom had me in dance classes, and then I got involved in a local theater company.
I went to UCLA as pre-med. When I was there my freshman year, I auditioned for a play and got it, and I was so passionate. I just loved acting so much that I decided to switch majors and pursue acting.
I definitely prefer working in comedy over drama, but at the same time, when it comes to comedy, I tend to prefer comedies that have a great sense of truth to them and that come from an honest place.
One of my favorite comedies is 'Groundhog Day' and 'Scrooged.' I love Bill Murray, and I think he's a great example of an actor who is funny.
I have a lot of anxiety about the red carpet. As a woman, it's uncomfortable to be in a position in which people are judging you, looking at what you're wearing, and criticizing you - not necessarily in a negative way.
I have an hourglass shape, and I think it's important to understand your body type and your personality type. Then make whatever is on trend and in fashion work for you.
