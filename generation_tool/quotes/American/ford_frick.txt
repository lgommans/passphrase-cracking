Take pride in your work at all times. Remember, respect for an umpire is created off the field as well as on.
Hear only the things you should hear - be deaf to others.
Avoid sarcasm. Don't insist on the last word.
I'd hate this to get out but I really like opera.
Review your work. You will find, if you are honest, that 90% of the trouble is traceable to loafing.
Never charge a player and, above all, no pointing your finger or yelling.
Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Keep all your personalities out of your work. Forget and forgive.
