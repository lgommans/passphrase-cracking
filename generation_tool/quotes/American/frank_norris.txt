American,Novelist
The People have a right to the Truth as they have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Truth is a thing immortal and perpetual, and it gives to us a beauty that fades not away in time.
The function of the novelist... is to comment upon life as he sees it.
No art that is not in the end understood by the People can live or ever did live a single generation.
