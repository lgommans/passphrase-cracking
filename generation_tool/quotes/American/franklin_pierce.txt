A Republic without parties is a complete anomaly. The histories of all popular governments show absurd is the idea of their attempting to exist without parties.
Frequently the more trifling the subject, the more animated and protracted the discussion.
The dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded.
