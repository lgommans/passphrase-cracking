Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.
Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love?
Pride is an admission of weakness; it secretly fears all competition and dreads all rivals.
Hearing nuns' confessions is like being stoned to death with popcorn.
I feel it is time that I also pay tribute to my four writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
Life is like a cash register, in that every account, every thought, every deed, like every sale, is registered and recorded.
The proud man counts his newspaper clippings, the humble man his blessings.
The big print giveth, and the fine print taketh away.
Baloney is flattery laid on so thick it cannot be true, and blarney is flattery so thin we love it.
Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.
