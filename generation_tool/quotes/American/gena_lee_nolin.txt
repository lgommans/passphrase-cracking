My children are the reason I laugh, smile and want to get up every morning.
My children teach me to slow down and enjoy life.
I want to work, but being a mom is my No. 1 priority.
I think Baywatch is such a hit here because of the weather.
Midwestern people stick together. Gee willikers, they work hard. There's no glitz, no glamour. When I was a girl in Duluth, Minnesota, I used to get up early and milk cows, so I know what hard work is.
I love a guy in a suit - someone who puts on his nice Armani pants.
