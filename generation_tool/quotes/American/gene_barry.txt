American,Actor
The attitude of the actor is his interpretation of what he reads, and the written word is what creates the role in the actor's mind, and I guess in reading the things that were given to me, I reacted as you guys saw me, you know.
I just wanted to be a guy who could earn a living as an actor, and I did that for a long time.
