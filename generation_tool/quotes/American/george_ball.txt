Nostalgia is a seductive liar.
Until 1956, America treated Israel not much differently from other friendly states.
Most Americans approach the problems of the Middle East with a pro-Israeli bias - and rightly so.
Yet the wonder of it all is that, while engaged in a seemingly endless struggle, the Israelis have managed to turn a desert into a garden.
The question is no longer whether the United States should contribute to assuring Israel's survival and prosperity; that goes without saying.
Not only must Americans admire Israel, there can be no doubt that we have an interest in, and special responsibility for, that valiant nation.
