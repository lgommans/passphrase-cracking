The way a team plays as a whole determines its success.
I have only one superstition... Touch all the bases when I hit a home run.
I'd give a year of my life if I could hit a homerun on opening day of this great new park.
It's hard to beat a person who never gives up.
I like to live as big as I can.
You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.
You're an actor, are you? Well, all that means is: you are irresponsible, irrational, romantic, and incapable of handling an adult emotion or a universal concept without first reducing it to something personal, material, sensational - and probably sexual!
I'll win more games playing everyday in the outfield than I will pitching every fourth day.
You know how bad my voice sounds - well it feels just as bad.
The only real game - I think - in the world is baseball.
Pitching just felt like the most natural thing in the world.
Striking out batters was easy.
How to hit home runs: I swing as hard as I can, and I try to swing right through the ball.
The harder you grip the bat, the more you can swing it through the ball, and the farther the ball will go.
I hit big or I miss big.
I know, but I had a better year than Hoover.
I'd play for half my salary if I could hit in this dump all the time.
I've never heard a crowd boo a homer, but I've heard plenty of boos after a strikeout.
You know this baseball game of ours comes up from the youth. That means the boys. And after you've been a boy, and grow up to know how to play ball, then you come to the boys you see representing themselves today in our national pastime.
To my sick little pal. I will try to knock you another homer, maybe two today.
Watch my dust.
