American,Politician
My whole professional life has been dedicated to improving access, affordability, quality and choice of health care.
My goal is to reach out to communicate every day, whether I'm in Washington or in the congressional district. In Washington, the best opportunity to do that is on the House floor. It's both a responsibility and an opportunity. I enjoy, every day, taking to the House floor to address an issue or event that is significant for constituents.
Obamacare is terminal. It is going to fail under the crushing weight of its own flawed design.
I spent 28 years working in healthcare. I thought I'd retired from non-profit community health care.
I obviously disagree with the individuals who do not support rural America and do not support rural airports. Under their philosophy, maybe we shouldn't even be paving roads in rural America, because there are fewer people that drive on them.
