It was great working with Kevin Smith - just a dream.
I had done student films for the School Of Visual Arts and for NYU and all these schools in New York, so those were my first film experiences, but they were student films, so I guess they don't really count.
I'm a loner. I like to be alone. I'm socially awkward.
When the attention is on me, off-camera, I get uncomfortable - sort of shy and at a loss for words, as you can probably tell?
When I was in high school, I wasn't really popular. I was picked on a lot. And then I did a talent show, and kids started to tell me that I did a good job. It was the first time that my peers told me that they liked what I was doing. Something clicked, and I knew that this is what I wanted to do.
I love Rob Zombie - I'd love to work with Rob Zombie or John Cameron Mitchell.
Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis in every single movie I've seen him in, except 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Mortal Thoughts,' which is another movie he was in that was very different from what he normally does.
I did a show back when I was in high school - so I was about 17 - and it was the first time I was on stage. I never even thought about being an actor before that, but after that experience, I knew it was what I wanted to do.
'Fresh' was maybe the third audition that I had after I got an agent, so I was crazy excited when I booked it.
I was named Class Clown in the high school yearbook, so I was always turning to comedy and laughter to heal and to get me through things.
I connect to humor really deeply, so I feel really comfortable just being in funny projects.
