I remember one game when I pitched in Yankee Stadium and gave up five runs in the first inning. It would have been easy to quit, but I shut 'em out the rest of the way, and we came back and won the game.
Never give up, and never give in.
What more can you ask for than to see a ballgame in spring?
Al Kaline bought a tee and a ball and swung at it all winter. Look where it got him: the Hall of Fame.
I think what hurt me all along was the label of 'war-time pitcher.' I've always resented that.
I know the Hall of Fame is the more sought-after thing. But I'm getting a bigger charge out of my uniform number being put away. Everything I worked hard for and wished for came true.
