Great moments are born from great oppurtunities.
You know, Willie Wonka said it best: we are the makers of dreams, the dreamers of dreams.
If I'd have went on the ice when this thing happened, someone would have speared me or something. It's a great feeling of accomplishment and pride. They had to do it; it was their moment.
This is your moment. You're meant to be here.
You're looking for players whose name on the front of the sweater is more important than the one on the back. I look for these players to play hard, to play smart and to represent their country.
And maybe I'm a little smarter now than I was before for all the stupid things I've done.
You're playing worse and worse every day and right now you're playing like it's next month.
We should be dreaming. We grew up as kids having dreams, but now we're too sophisticated as adults, as a nation. We stopped dreaming. We should always have dreams.
Everything goes in cycles, to a degree.
Maybe I'm sort of like the players - there's still a lot of little boy in me.
I'm a dreamer.
