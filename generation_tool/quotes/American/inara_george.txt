American,Musician
I was raised in Topanga Canyon. It's an eclectic community up in the Santa Monica mountains. A lot of musicians lived there - Joni Mitchell, Neil Young - as well as artists and craftspeople.
I have three older brothers, and we all have different combinations of parents. My father was the best man at my mom's first wedding! And my brother's mother - my dad's first wife - is the sister to my mom's first husband's second wife. So my brothers are both stepcousins and stepbrothers. It's very '70s rock.
Obviously Hall & Oates wasn't overlooked by the masses in terms of the record sales.
I think a show is for fun, and the thing about playing live is that you make mistakes, and that's what's sort of exciting about it.
There's a certain attitude to Los Angeles.
I do think that I can sing, though I actually like voices I can't imitate.
