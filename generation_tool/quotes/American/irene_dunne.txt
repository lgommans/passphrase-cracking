American,Actress
You see I found I didn't have to act to be happy.
I'll leave the swearing to the Jane Fondas.
So being two different people in one day unnerved me to no end.
Years ago the public used to hound me but now I can go shopping in peace.
I always believed in my characters. I lived them.
But friends invited me to a private screening of Emmanuelle and said I'd learn a few things. But I know all the swear words. I just don't use them. So I declined.
And yet I think The White Cliffs of Dover one of my best films.
A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.
