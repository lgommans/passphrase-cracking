American,Businessman
I have no contracts with my clients; just a handshake is enough.
In a deal, you give and take. You compromise. Then you grab the cash and catch the next train out of town.
The whole point of having money, and working and making money, is to enjoy and spend it.
Sometimes I wake up in the morning and there's nothing doing, so I decide to make something happen by lunch.
I call myself a literary agent simply to distinguish myself from actors' agents.
I'm not a very religious man, but I'm proud to be a Jew.
