Atlanta? I think it's the greatest city anywhere I know of.
We didn't make the mistakes that many other cities did.
The city of Atlanta has always had a good spirit.
The only thing you think of is that you are in the middle and that you've got to find a way to stop it.
A lot of things happened in a lot of places. And to see how well it was handled in Atlanta. There are a lot of reasons for Atlanta being a special town in the Civil Rights era.
