American,Author
I've been writing for a long time. I sat down to write my first novel in the middle of March of 1982.
I now can be sure that, once I start writing a book, I'll be able to finish it. I've also become more assured about my 'voice' as a writer and being able to keep the characters true to themselves.
I play golf - badly.
