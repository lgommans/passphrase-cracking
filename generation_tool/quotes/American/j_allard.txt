We didn't have our online service developed. We had never shipped a console game before as a company. So we were developing a lot of new competencies as a company and assembling a new team.
Right now, more people enjoy movies, music, television and movies than they do video games.
Having wires strewn across your couch and across the floor is a big deal to a lot of people.
We're going to do something that's really unprecedented in the industry by launching the console in all three major markets for the same holiday. It's never been done before.
The chips are in production, the machines aren't. So we've got a little bit of work left to do.
I don't worry about great visuals that they showed that weren't actually running on real hardware. It doesn't matter. Gamers don't make their purchase decisions based on movies that were shown in May for products that come out in March.
When we get the final hardware, the performance is just going to skyrocket.
