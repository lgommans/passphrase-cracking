Don't let your dreams be dreams.
If it seems like you are playing around and not practicing, that's when you know you really love it.
It's as simple as something that nobody knows.
My friend told me later he got the chicken pox. I told him I caught politics and never got over it.
Our dreams are made of real things, like a shoebox full of photographs.
It takes a long, hard effort and sustained determination to reduce crime. We will stay the course and we are confident that the numbers will continue to go down.
I made a lot of mistakes out of the ring, but I never made any in it.
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot.
Slow down, everyone. You're moving too fast.
