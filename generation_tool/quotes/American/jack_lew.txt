American,Public Servant
I think there's no higher calling in terms of a career than public service, which is a chance to make a difference in people's lives and improve the world.
I've been really privileged to work for two presidents - President Obama and President Clinton - who are both people of faith, who value faith, and who respect that others have the same feelings in their own lives.
