American,Politician
Sometimes an active policy is best advanced by doing nothing until the right time - or never.
Never let the other fellow set the agenda.
Sometimes you move publicly, sometimes privately. Sometimes quietly, sometimes at the top of your voice.
When you have energy companies like Shell and British Petroleum, both of which are perhaps represented in this room, saying there is a problem with excess carbon dioxide emission, I think we ought to listen.
You don't need to know who's playing on the White House tennis court to be a good president.
I understand personally that it is frustrating to lose presidential elections by narrow margins.
This is what happens, when, for the first time in modern history, a candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of an election for president.
