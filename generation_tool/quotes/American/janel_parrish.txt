In every high school, there is a clique.
I like to stay hydrated with water throughout the day and snack on apples, but my guilty pleasure would definitely be a caramel macchiato from Starbucks!
For me, my favorite trends of summer are lots of color, wedges, rompers and bright lipstick.
My top three personal best-dressed list: Lea Michele. I think she really knows how to dress. Blake Lively is great. And Rihanna. I really respect how bold and out-there she is.
I definitely am a Twihard!
I am terrified of sharks, so I don't surf!
I'm lucky to have parents who used to be bodybuilders! They help me keep fit by going to the gym and training with me. I'm also addicted to Cardio Barre classes and hiking.
I'm hoping to do more with my music. I did the stage musical 'Spring Awakening' recently and it reignited the love I have for singing.
Music is my passion, singing, performing. I play piano and musical theater is my background.
Yes, I have been studying piano since I was six. Classical, jazz, compositional, Broadway, everything. I just love it all.
I like jewelry. Big rings, big necklaces. Shoes, belts, luggage.
I am really looking forward to being a role model for girls.
