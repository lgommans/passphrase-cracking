American,Politician
I hope to be the go-to person on international trade and industry. I think no one before me or after me will ever have so much knowledge about America's ports.
A lot of people don't understand how cargo coming into our ports matters, not just to Southern California but to every single congressional district. I want to educate on that issue.
I think my mom and dad knew from the very beginning that I was destined to go into public service.
I was born into public service.
My family has been in politics a long time in Los Angeles. We very much believe we are elected to represent the people. I mean, I am to give voice to, you know, the over half a million people I represent in my congressional district. I mean, that's the way it works.
I think a loaded weapon aboard an airplane, whether it's in the cargo section or in your overhead baggage, is a security issue.
