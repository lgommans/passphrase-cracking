American,Actor
You get to that age where you're watching a lot of television, and who doesn't want to be on television?
It's not like a corporate job where the more you accumulate on your resume and the more hours you put in, the higher up you get; it's simply not the case. That being said, if I had known that and known what kind of career I'd get into, I still would have pursued it.
I've always wanted to be an animator. That's an ultimate art form, right there.
I want to direct, write, produce... y'know, I love the entertainment industry.
Any actor will tell you there's more of a schedule to doing a television show. That's why you'll notice a lot of big movie actors are doing television, and they'll tell you, it's because of the schedule.
I think I'm sort of locked into the sitcom genre.
Everyone loves Disney, it just has a special place in everyone's heart.
I can record auditions from my office in my home.
There was a time - and I used to get made fun of a lot - that all I collected was soundtracks.
I'm more of a visual person, but I think that reading's extremely important. But I'm very easily distracted. It takes certain books to really grab you in.
I collect action figures, mostly. I have a Batman room, with just Batman stuff, and I have a Disney collection.
Voice-acting, on the fun meter, is off the scale. You show up, you don't have to be all primped up, or dressed up. And you get to work with some amazing people, and goof off for four hours.
