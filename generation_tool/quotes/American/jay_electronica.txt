For me, my life is a journey.
All my dreams are coming true all across the board for some reason.
The bar is so low in rap - mediocrity is king!
What makes me different from everybody else just boils down to dissatisfaction.
I've been homeless on a few occasions.
The first time I was homeless was when I went to Atlanta. I was in a homeless shelter, then when I got a job I used to miss the curfew for the shelter. So I ended up sleeping outside in the streets.
