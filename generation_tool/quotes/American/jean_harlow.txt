American,Actress
I like to wake up each morning feeling a new man.
Underwear makes me uncomfortable and besides my parts have to breathe.
My God, must I always wear a low-cut dress to be important?
No one ever expects a great lay to pay all the bills.
When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.
I wasn't born an actress, you know. Events made me one.
Don't give me books for Christmas; I already have a book.
Men like me because I don't wear a brassiere.
Women like me because I don't look like a girl who would steal a husband. At least not for long.
