American,Actor
I feel gigantic affection for all of Homeland Security at airports.
I went from rotary phone to Twitter. And was appalled at the notion.
We actors are an especially superstitious lot.
Actors usually respond to minor aspects of their own character or things that even feel disparate from themselves.
I've been blessed. Starting with Steppenwolf Theater and onward, learning from wonderful actors and getting to play with wonderful actors.
