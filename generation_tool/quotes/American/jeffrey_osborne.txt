The beauty of all these years of singing the anthem is that I got a chance to meet athletes that I love, and there was a mutual respect.
The beauty of recording in L.A. is that most of the musicians that are on the record live here, so it was easy to get world class artists like Rick Braun to swing by and play a little trumpet, Everette Harp on sax, guitarist Paul Jackson.
I think I was affected quite a bit by musical and creative influences that go all the way back to my childhood.
I think if you look back at the lead singers that left groups that didn't make it, you'll see that a lot of them were songwriters like Lionel Richie. I mean, they were able to control their own destiny.
