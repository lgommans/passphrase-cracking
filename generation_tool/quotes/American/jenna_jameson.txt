The first thing that comes out of my mouth is always right.
Oh well, when I was younger I was known for breaking hearts. I am the kind of person that falls passionately in love but then a couple of months down the line, I fall out of love.
I try my hardest to push the point that I am a feminist.
I'm like the girl next door... I just have a bad streak.
I've always wanted to be a professional dancer, I'd always wanted to be a ballerina. I trained for 13 years but it never came to be.
I am very driven by fame and success; I like to succeed at everything I do.
When you're fearful, you stumble.
My definition of courage is never letting anyone define you.
I'll be out having a good time and stick my gum on the side of my cup - I know, it's a horrible habit - and people will steal the cup.
