American,Actress
I grew up as a tomboy, so I'm used to being around guys.
I was living in Florida working as a model and got my first acting job there in the movie 'Wild Things.' I thought it was sort of cool and decided to do some training.
While growing up, every sitcom you could think of, I would watch it, and I loved it.
