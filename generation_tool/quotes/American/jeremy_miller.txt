I have attention deficit disorder, so sitting in a classroom is not the best thing for me.
My grandmother was a chef, and she taught me to cook. One day I want a restaurant, a small Italian grill. That's my aspiration.
For about two years, I was a little wild. I was out partying, having adventures.
