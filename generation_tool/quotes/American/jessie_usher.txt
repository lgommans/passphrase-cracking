For the most part, it's about keeping the same people around you - people who really care about your well-being - they keep you focused.
I like to dance. I'm not going to say that I'm a good dancer.
I went to school for culinary arts. I love to cook. That's a talent not a lot of people know about.
As far long-term aspirations, other than acting, I do want to direct a little bit. I want to get on the production side and eventually start a production company and maybe make some projects of my own.
I'm not embarrassed by any of my music. I'll even own up to the old Backstreet Boys albums.
I broke my ring finger in a trampoline accident.
There was all of about 30 kids where I went to school; we were all one clique.
My sister was an actress before I ever got into it, and I kinda wanted to do what she was doing. That was a really young age. Four years old? I just followed her everywhere and just wanted to do what she wanted to do. I didn't even know what I was getting myself into. I just wanted to be where she was and do what she was doing.
Will Smith. He's been my career idol for years and years. I used to sit back and watch and study 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' over and over. It's the only TV show that I've watched all the way through maybe five times.
I've had so many bad auditions! I tell people all the time, there's differences, what makes an audition good or what makes an audition bad. Sometimes you're just off, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.
Brad Pitt's role in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' - I want to do that so bad! That's one of my favorite movies of all time, and that character was so funny.
