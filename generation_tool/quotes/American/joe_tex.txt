American,Musician
I was born on May 17, 1979, in Newark, New Jersey.
Soon after I was born, my parents moved to the South Florida area, and I've lived here ever since (with a few years of living in both Portugal and Brazil in my younger days).
I started bowling when I was 14, my freshman year in high school.
I vividly remember bowling 20 + games a day, 2 or 3 times a week.
Well, my hand never fell off, and within no time, I was bowling competitively in leagues and tournaments.
Currently, I bowl regional tournaments out of the PBA Southern Region.
