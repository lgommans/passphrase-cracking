I don't go crazy buying expensive technology. I'd probably say my laptops and TVs are the most expensive things I've bought.
We shot 'CBGB' in Savannah, and then I took another project there afterwards called 'Killing Winston Jones.' It's a dark comedy with Richard Dreyfuss, Danny Glover, Jon Heder, Danny Masterson and Aly Michalka. It's a great cast and a beautiful film.
I started in the psychological thriller side of feature filmmaking with 'Spiral,' which was the first one that I wrote and directed and played the lead in.
