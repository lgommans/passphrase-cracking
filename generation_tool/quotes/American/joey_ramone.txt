To me, punk is about being an individual and going against the grain and standing up and saying 'This is who I am'.
I enjoyed my life when I had nothing... and kinda like the idea of just being happy with me.
All punk is is attitude. That's what makes it. The attitude.
Rock n' roll is very special to me. It's my lifeblood.
Well, I think we're the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world.
I mean, like, rock n' roll was always about spirit and fun.
There's nobody as good as the Ramones, never will be. I mean everybody's just emulated us and now everybody just kinda takes our sound as their foundations.
For better or worse, MTV sort of bridges the whole country together almost like the BBC does in England. It's opened up everything so wide that it's possible for everyone to have different ideas.
When a band like Blondie re-forms, you wish them the best.
We always stayed true to what the Ramones are.
The Ramones own the fountain of youth. Experiencing us is like having the fountain of youth.
Everybody's just emulated us and now everybody just kinda takes our sound as their foundations.
The Eagles and the Captain and Tennille ruled the airwaves, and we were the answer to it.
To me, John Lennon and Elvis Presley were punks, because they made music that evoked those emotions in people.
When I was a kid growing up in the '60s, music was an outlet for enlightenment, frustration, rebellion. It was more about individualism. Today it's just like a big business.
