My boy, one small breeze doesn't make a wind storm.
Cobb would have to play center field on my all time team. But where would that put Speaker? In left. If I had them both, I would certainly play them that way.
I think we can win it if my brain holds out.
In playing or managing, the game of ball is only fun for me when I'm out in front and winning. I don't give a hill of beans for the rest of the game.
Learn to know every man under you, get under his skin, know his faults. Then cater to him - with kindness or roughness as his case may demand.
Sportsmanship and easygoing methods are all right, but it is the prospect of a hot fight that brings out the crowds.
There is but one game and that game is baseball.
The team that gets off to a good start wins pennants.
Why shouldn't we pitch to Babe Ruth? We pitch to better hitters in the National League.
With my team I am an absolute czar. My men know it. I order plays and they obey. If the don't, I fine them.
No club that wins a pennant once is an outstanding club. One which bunches two pennants is a good club. But a team which can win three in a row really achieves greatness.
