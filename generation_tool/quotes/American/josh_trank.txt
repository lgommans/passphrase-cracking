I'm a believer that you shouldn't really talk about the drawing until you're done with the drawing.

To me the most important thing is a good story, though I know how cliche that sounds.
In older science fiction stories, they had to rely on storytelling as opposed to spectacle. The old run of the 'Twilight Zone,' the star was the writing and the storytelling, and the characters and the twists and the cleverness in the setup and payoff and execution.
