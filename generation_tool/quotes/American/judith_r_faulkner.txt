American,Businessman
I get so many requests for interviews. If I talk to everyone, we can't do our job with our customers and work on our software. It would be hard to stay focused.
I was an undergrad math major and a grad student in computer science. I'm hugely introverted, not atypical of math majors.
I like to keep some privacy, be a normal person.
I like to go around, and people not knowing who I am.
