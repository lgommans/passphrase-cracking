American,Musician
Ilene Weiss and I went to Girls High together.
I've been in New York City now for 22 years.
From the minute I heard music I knew why I was born.
Im an animal love, but I don't have the smarts to be a vet, or the heart to have been a vet cause I cry over any wounded animal.
I don't know what else I would have done, because I love music too much.
For anyone who has that calling and is trying also to make a living at it, it is really hard.
I'm as healthy as an ox.
I'm praying that was my one little dip in the cancer pool. I hope never to have to revisit that, but I learned a lot, I'm cancer free with a bright and hopeful future.
