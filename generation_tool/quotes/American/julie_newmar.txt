You can't fail. The further you fall, the greater the opportunity for growth and change.
More is not necessarily better. Better is better.
I'm magnificent! I'm 5' 11" and I weigh 135 pounds, and I look like a racehorse.
Tell me I'm beautiful, it's nothing. Tell me I'm intellectual - I know it. Tell me I'm funny, and it's the greatest compliment in the world anyone could give me.
The '60s was the end of the America that the rest of the world liked.
When you're young and good-looking, you've got to behave. But when you're old, you can get away with murder.
I'm just rich. I own businesses and I love it.
Beauty is what I feel my life is about - the garden, the house, whatever. I see the world that way, yet it isn't.
