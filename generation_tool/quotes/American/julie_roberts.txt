I love going to coffee shops and just sitting and listening.
A circumstance that I was dealing with when recording my second album was I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
Life is like a movie to me. Everybody has their own movie that's playing out every day, and you're writing it.
I didn't have a good childhood growing up.
My Christmases have always just been very simple and about family.
