I love cartoons, I love comic books and graphic novels. 'Batman: The Animated Series' was a huge influence on me when I was younger.
I'm a huge Wonder Woman fan - I have about 12 coffee mugs at home!
I always knew that I wanted to do voiceovers as part of my career. I just kind of didn't expect it to take off the way it did. I couldn't be happier. I love the chance to play so many different characters every day.
The people that are fans of animation are really the people that are keeping the art form of animation alive. If you like cartoons, support the cartoons.
