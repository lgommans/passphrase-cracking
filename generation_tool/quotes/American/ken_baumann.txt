American,Actor
I don't eat fast food often, but I love tacos. I could write prophetically about how perfect the taco is.
Growing up, my mom would watch 'Notting Hill' a lot. She loves Hugh Grant.
I love art and I think I was destined to end up in some aspect of the arts.
I would sleep 12 hours a day if I could.
