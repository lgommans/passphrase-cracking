This hiatus coming up I'm looking at a comedy because I need the balance.
I feel that the work that I have done in the comedy arena, is priceless in terms of what I learned, timing, everything that these incredibly talented performers were generous enough in teaching me.
I like comedy, I love it very much, I love laughing.
I don't like to be pigeonholed; I don't like when people won't see me for something because they don't think I can do it. I always feel like, at least give me the shot.
I said, 'I'll give myself two years. If I can't support myself as an actress within two years, then I'll go back to choreography.'
So the only things I was being allowed to audition for were small roles in comedies. It broke my heart. No one would see me for anything else. I knew, in order to open up my career, I had to leave or that's all I would ever be given.
Talk about divine intervention. I can't even tell you how blessed I feel.
There's nothing worse than having a very strong female character and then suddenly having it go away.
I have deep comedic roots, and I want to be funny.
In the case of 'News Radio,' I loved that show. I loved the actors and the producers, but I was longing very much for something more to sink my teeth into me. I think it was an incredibly smart show, but I found myself on the peripheral of a lot of it.
I had always done theater during the entire six years I was with 'CSI: Miami.'
