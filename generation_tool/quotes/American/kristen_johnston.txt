American,Actress
I don't consider myself a goody-goody, but I like to be perceived as classy.
And to be different is great. You don't want to be the same.
If you love it, and work really hard at it, it will really happen, I believe. I'm living proof.
It was only when I moved to New York that I realized tall is good.
I'd so much rather people think I was funny than pretty.
I like people-watching and fading into crowds.
My way was not to be the petite, gorgeous, little cheerleader. My way of getting by was making people laugh.
To actually be allowed to be beautiful is a total first for me.
I really came out to L.A. to take the money and run.
I was such a dork. I was too big. I was really gangly.
I was voted Biggest Ham and Likeliest to Become a Celebrity.
May I say, if you were suddenly put into a woman's body, wouldn't you be slightly interested in your breasts, and why people look at certain parts of you, and why certain parts move like they do?
Onstage, I was never the ingenue.
I was a full foot taller than any child my age.
I literally felt like a freak, which is another aspect of the role of Sally that I relate to: total outsider.
But this show reminds me that there are other aspects to me besides the fact that I'm a funny chick.
I spent 10 years in New York doing theater.
I was born in Washington, D.C., and I was raised in Milwaukee.
I'm a strong person, but I'd never resort to violence.
I've always just gone with the best role, and I don't care if it's in theater, film or television.
When you're that tall, people talk about it all the time.
I think Janeane Garofalo is incredibly funny, and I love Dennis Miller.
I want to play a Disney villainess so badly.
I am, uh... a 6 foot tall woman, I feel like I'm a healthy size, I'm not anorexic; and I feel that people who aren't anorexic are punished... for not being anorexic.
