American,Actress
I love playing the bad girl.
Any woman that is willing to take control of their life and do what they want to do to make their living, I have a lot of respect for.
I feel like any time you, as an actor, can be surrounded by other amazing actors, you can't do anything but grow.
I would never steal another woman's man.
