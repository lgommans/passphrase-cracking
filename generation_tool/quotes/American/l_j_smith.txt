I like strong female characters. I try to write them as role models for young girls.
'Shadow Souls' pushes probably every border that you can.
I don't know how to make Harper and Alloy want me, not just my name.
I've thought that 'Soulmate' in the 'Night World' series would make a really nice TV-movie or just a movie.
