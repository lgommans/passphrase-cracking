I still have never met Harry Saltzman, and was told he is quite unpleasant.
I think I was only divorced once, and the rest were annulments. Or, maybe not. I can't keep track actually, because it's not that important. I just am who I am.
I went through my whole life wanting to feel I belonged. I was very, very lonely, so I would marry people that I wasn't really in love with, and who weren't right for me, because I hoped they would be.
No, I never ever considered myself attractive.
