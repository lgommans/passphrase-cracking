I am one of the 11.5% of New Yorkers who remain traumatized by the events of September 11.
I am not sure why, but I have been obsessed by the Atom Bomb ever since it first happened.
But when I came back into the city for the first time last November, I thought every truck, every building was going to blow up. It has truly changed me something fierce.
