American,Actor
I don't want my life to be about a house and a car.
If I get too type-cast, that's the worst possible scenario.
Love is a wonderful thing that one misses.
I studied drama.
I moved to Dallas in 1975 and stayed there until 1980. That's when I decided it was time to move to L.A.
The imperfections in my family made me learn to deal with things on my own and solve problems for myself.
My parents did their best - that earns a lot of forgiveness. But they say children grow up in spite of their parents, and I think I did.
I've done fine in this business, but I've never made quite enough money to have a family or have many options.
I can't be a role model. I just can't be.
As an actor, what I can do is tell the truth. At least, I hope I can tell the truth - a dramatic truth, but still an honest portrayal.
Characters actors don't usually get noticed until they're about 38 or so.
I usually play big and mean, big and stupid, or big and funny.
