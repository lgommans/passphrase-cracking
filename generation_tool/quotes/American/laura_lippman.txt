Anyone can love a perfect place. Loving Baltimore takes some resilience.
It's very different to have this kid that I'm truly responsible for.
I've gotten to do a lot of stuff, traveled, worked hard at my career.
I'm at the age most people are sending their kids off to college.
I think I'm part of a generation of crime writers all of whom woke up independently and recoiled with horror at the fact that we'd chosen this very conservative genre.
I think Baltimore suffers from nostalgia and it keeps us from being honest in talking about what really happened here. A place doesn't have to be perfect to be beloved, and I love this city and I love it better for seeing its flaws.
