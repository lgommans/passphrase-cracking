American,Actress
I'm a big Ralph Lauren girl, but I love vintage clothing. I like the whole western jeans and boots style. I love vintage T-shirts and flannels, and there's nothing like a great vintage sweatshirt.
I was living in Evanston, Illinois and I was taking theater classes down the street, and our theater school was kind of affiliated with an agency, and so I went on one audition for whatever that movie was, 'My Stepmother is an Alien' or whatever it was, and 'Roseanne' was my second audition.
There was a period when I really had to ask myself, 'What does acting mean to me?' I'm not someone who's content being famous, with that whole lifestyle. I had to realize I could find a balance between what I like to do and what people think you're 'supposed' to do as an actress.
There's nothing like watching Dr. Oz and working out at the same time; you feel like you're the healthiest human being on the planet.
