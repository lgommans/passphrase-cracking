I knew Ali would beat Foreman - absolutely. At Deer Lake, his fight camp in Pennsylvania, his training sessions were awesome.
Foreman had annihilated every single one of his opponents to that point, but here was Ali, going to Africa, selling himself as the 'real deal' black man.
Ali was actually able to fool some people into thinking that Foreman was actually a white man.
If my parents were to hear that their son won an Academy Award, they'd roll over in their graves. I was the luckiest person, but that luck came through the grace of Muhammad Ali.
I built a relationship and a rapport with Muhammad Ali, and I could never top that experience.
