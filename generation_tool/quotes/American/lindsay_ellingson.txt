Growing up I always shopped at Victoria's Secret with my mom and saw Angels like Gisele and Karolina Kurkova in the windows.
It's exciting for me to be home in California where I'm from and to be working with Victoria's Secret.
Valentine's Day is my favorite holiday.
When it comes to exercise, I don't like anything that's too serious.
I've been dancing for 10 years.
Anytime someone says we're channelling 1960s, I'm like, I'm in, I love it.
