Sea Hunt was the first time anyone tackled a show that took place underwater. The stories were sort of exciting for kids, like cops and robbers underwater.
Bear Valley is the hidden treasure of the Sierra.
As time went on, I got envious and wanted to do a lot of stunts myself.
Carrying those double tanks around all the time got to be a little rough on me. I had to put that damn wetsuit on and take it off, sometimes three or four times a day.
For four years doing that same character all the time kind of bothered me. Butit opened up a lot of doors.
I needed to feed my family. I read a couple of the episodes. How can you keep on doing the same thing?
I'm foremost an actor. I feel embarrassed being compared to the guys who really work at it. I fake it, I make believe I know all about it, which is what you're supposed to do as an actor.
There's a lot to be said about what's happening to our ocean, big companies polluting it with their oil and all the raw garbage that's being spilled in there.
We wanted to set a good example for the growing number of divers watching.
We worked under a lot of pressure... three days to do an episode, sometimes two in a week, 39 episodes a year.
