American,Actor
I love a girl with a sense of humor. Someone who can make me laugh and that I can get along with and talk with and who is just sweet overall, inside and out.
I was always a class clown, so I never had trouble fitting in; I just had trouble finding out where I really wanted to be.
My whole family is really tight-knit. We're a really good team.
Flying is like the ultimate superpower; it's just, like, the coolest thing.
I like Katy Perry. I mean, what is there not to like?! She's crazy, she's fun and she has some crazy pipes on her. She can sing.
I don't really get nervous, ever. I just have a good time.
I think a little bit of competition is always good.
Just date people you like, then you're guaranteed to have fun.
The stage for our whole show is actually really interesting and a lot of fun. There's always something going on so we figure even the people who come up and don't know Big Time Rush love the show because there's always something going on, so that's what we love about it.
