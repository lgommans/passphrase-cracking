American,Actress
I think a lot of people who are child actors - it's a weird thing.
I do like pop music. It's that certain thing that it gives you: the adrenaline rush, that instant gratification.
I liked to dye my hair as a teenager. I dyed it a lot of different colours: blue, red, pink.
I really like bowling.
I was very interested in acting as a kid. I loved to perform.
I was pretty obnoxious as a kid.
I had a nice life. It had its challenges like anybody's life, I guess.
I have two younger sisters who are 11 years younger than me. So I was an only child for a while.
I love Harry Potter. I've read all the books several times.
