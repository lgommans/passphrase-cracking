American,Musician
When I have a chunk of time that I can really dedicate to music, I really want to get into it. I want to do some really hard stuff and push myself.
Conservatory training is so much. There's so much emphasis on playing perfectly in tune and being perfect and doing everything as it's written.
If you've been trained to listen to mistakes your whole life, you forget to listen to opportunities.
I've got, like, too many things that I'd like to try and do, so I'm trying to figure out where the natural pull is strongest.
I definitely think of myself as a musician first.
Classical music is always a really great way for me to get my chops to where I want them to be.
