It's so hard to be the girl in a country song, so we're speaking up.
For some reason, the word 'feminist' freaks people out, but when you look it up, all it means is equal opportunity.
Being a woman in country is really empowering. It's a genre where you can truly say whatever you want to say as long as you're 100% behind your message and who you are.
A fan almost pulled me off stage once, and that was a little scary because I totally almost ate it!
Country fans are the most loyal in the world, but they know every song that you put out - not just the singles.
At first, I did have that thought, like, 'Oh crap, what are we going to do after?' Then I realized 'Girl in a Country Song' was an honest, truthful song, and we were telling our truth, and that's all we have to do - write songs that are true and tell our stories.
With this business, you have to learn to go with the flow. Not being able to grow in comfort is a beautiful thing when you're uncomfortable, so just embrace it and roll with it, and you'll come out stronger.
When my phone pops up with Dierks Bentley, I'm like, 'Oh my gosh!! Okay, wait. He's supposed to be, like, my friend. I'm supposed to be cool.'
We played 'Girl in a Country Song' in front of Scott Borchetta, and he loved it.
