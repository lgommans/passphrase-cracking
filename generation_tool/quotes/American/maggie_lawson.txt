Rice cakes and peanut butter is my favorite snack in the whole wide world.
William Shatner just reeks of cool.
I grew up in Kentucky, so we do not have a pro team. My family was split between the Cubs and the Reds. I would say I go Cubs usually. That's sort of where I grew up. My older brother was a huge Reds fan.
I played softball for a few years growing up. Both my brothers played baseball.
I've always wanted to work with dogs, so in high school, I worked at the Humane Society for a little while. I honestly think, even today, that would be the other career I would go into. Somehow I would be involved with animals.
