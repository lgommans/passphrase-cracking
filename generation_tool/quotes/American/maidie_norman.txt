American,Actress
I am a Republican because the United States is a republic, and the views we hold represent the foundation our country was built on so many years ago.
When I was young, I was rather attractive, and I thought that I would be a leading lady. I always thought of myself as a dramatic actress, but of course the opportunities for blacks weren't there at the time.
I thought 'The Well' was going to launch my career, but nothing happened.
