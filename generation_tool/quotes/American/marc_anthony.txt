If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life.
These opportunities don't come around too often. It's quite an honor and a privilege to be able to sit here today saying that I'm a part-owner of an NFL team.
What you see is what you get. My God, I don't have the time nor the energy to live up to some persona.
Being Puerto Rican, born and raised on the streets of New York, you go, 'Wow, you're still friends with your ex, man? Really? That's weird.' I don't play that.
Fame is addictive. Money is addictive. Attention is addictive. But golf is second to none.
Be quiet, or my wife will take away your first born and make him or her work in one of her sweatshops!
I say it every day - I'm the luckiest man on earth.
What Jennifer Lopez puts out, it's not Latin music.
My thing is music, period.
My mum always told me 95 per cent of success was partnering well.
First you date the songs, and then you get engaged and then you marry them. They have to stand the test of time, because they are going to be yours for the next 20, 30, 40 years. So you had better choose right.
I just want to sing, I want to work on my music, I want to make my movies, that's all I want to do.
I'm a huge sports fan.
I'm not a traditional sonero, at least not in the way they want me to be, I'm an interpreter, and I reach people in a different level.
I'm not a salsa singer who wants to sing in English, and I'm not this American kid who wants to sing Spanish.
I come from a pop background, but I'm also a Puerto Rican and I do feel this music. My approach to salsa is a humble one, and I defy anybody to prove that I'm faking it.
Celebrity watching and speculation is almost like a sport.
'Livin' la Vida Loca' is not Latin music. It does not represent Latin music.
I think in general I've never dared compose in Spanish. First of all, it is such an intricate language.
