American,Actor
There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars.
I'm proud of my background, so I hope there will be more roles where Hispanics are being portrayed.
Like they say, you can learn more from a guide in one day than you can in three months fishing alone.
In some cases, the casting directors have casted blindly and have not looked into my ethnic background.
Eventually though, I'd like to have my own production company. Then I could create great opportunities not only for myself, but for other actors as well.
I grew up in a household without a lot of problems and they have been very supportive from day one.
I haven't gotten labeled as a Hispanic actor.
I like to consider myself an actor who just happens to be Hispanic.
I love talking about women because they are a constant study and you're always learning.
Right now, I'd like to just continue on a series where I am doing good work with a balance of comedy and drama. That and do occasional features and movies.
That's what 90 percent of the people talk about when they're first exposed to the fish.
Usually I'll go to San Diego to hang out with my parents if I want to unwind.
