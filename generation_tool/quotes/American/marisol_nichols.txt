Growing up, I just wanted to be like everyone else. I didn't value or understand the beauty in being different at the time in my life.
I really want to work with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.
I would love to do a really stupid character on 'The Office'. I'm so an 'Office' fan.
If you want a favorite book, Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game'. You'll be hooked. I think he's written like twelve or thirteen.
I am not really ever accused of being shy or meek.
I'm pretty good with languages.
If you were to ask me to speak Swedish or Dutch or German, I have no idea if I could pull that off!
I can't wait to use a BabyBjoern. I'm in love with the Orbit Baby stroller, and I also really like the Bugaboo.
Every year, my family and I would go visit my mom's family in Texas. We would drive from Chicago to Texas, and once we started to get towards San Antonio, everyone looked like me! It was such a great feeling. Everyone had the same brown skin that I did.
If I'm going to work, hopefully I have a late call time, and can hang out with Rain and our nanny until we shoot.
I can bring Rain with me everywhere I go, but when she's in school, I don't know what I'll do. The longest I've been away from her is three days, and I cried my eyes out. The first day of school will be so hard.
