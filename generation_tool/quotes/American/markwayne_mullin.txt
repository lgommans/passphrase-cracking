American,Politician
The fundamentals that founded our great nation included the freedom of speech and religion.
I'm willing to negotiate, but not compromise my core principles.
I'm not for raising taxes on anyone - period.
Oklahoma has a respect for our neighbors. That's the Oklahoma standard.
You've got to quit judging people just because they have an 'R' or a 'D' in front of their name. We don't do that in Oklahoma.
You've got to build a relationship. You can't just deal with people when it's business. If it is, then you always have to assume that they have an angle when they come at you.
You've got to respect people; you've got to understand where they come from. We know where people in Oklahoma come from - that's why we get along.
