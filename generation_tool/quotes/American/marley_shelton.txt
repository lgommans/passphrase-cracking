To me, 'Scream' is a masterpiece on every level - the performances, the humor, the tone - it's just flawless.
When I read 'Planet Terror,' it was like nothing I had ever read before remotely, and yet it has so many references.

Courteney Cox is such a great actress.
There's something fabulously decadent about staying in a hotel across the street from where you live.
