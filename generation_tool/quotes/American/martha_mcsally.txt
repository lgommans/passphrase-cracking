American,Soldier
Before I became a fighter pilot, everyone said that women didn't have the physical strength. Well, I had just completed the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon.
If we want the most effective fighting force, we need to pick the most qualified capable man for the job, even if it's a woman.
When I see something messed up, I'm going to challenge it.
I think there is a longing in everyone for a personal relationship with God.
I'm probably one of the only people who has voted for the speaker of the House but didn't serve in Congress.
I served my country in uniform for 26 years.
I just personally decided I was going to be the first woman fighter pilot.
I have three older brothers. I'm Irish. I'm feisty.
Raising taxes in an economic downturn is not a good idea.
When you value people, you give them freedom.
If it were in our national security to deploy to South Africa under apartheid, would we have found it acceptable or customary to segregate African American soldiers from other American soldiers, and say, 'It's just a cultural thing'? I don't think so. I would hope not.
