Every day is a good day to be alive, whether the sun's shining or not.
I didn't choose a word or anything. I just wrote the song until it stopped.
I'm in this business because I despise honest labor.
Talent is being able to please people.
I have so much fun on stage that I should have to pay to get in.
The great songs just come out. If it comes quick, just leave it that way.
I only drank for three years of my life, but I drank enough in those three years to last me the rest of my life... It's a religious thing.
