American,Actress
I love to read, and I love to write. I love to read. You have no idea how many books I have.
I love to sing. I'm learning guitar right now.
I love all the 'Twilight' characters. I can watch Kristen Stewart and think, 'I want to be that role someday.'
I'm a huge 'Vampire Diaries' fan. My sister got me into 'Doctor Who.' Those are my biggest things.
I'm definitely really proud of 'Frenemies.' That was something that I loved.
I love to read and I love to write. I love to read. You have no idea how many books I have. I love to sing.
