American,Musician
Bands are like people. They're born and then they die.
I don't have an iPod.
I feel really different from other musicians.
I like things that sound like maybe they shouldn't belong.
I will go through these style phases. I think it's confusing in some ways. People like bands to be really consistent.
I'm much more of a musician than a poet. I just feel much more confident about my musical abilities.
I've gotten to a point where I don't want lyrics to mean anything.
I'm starting to feel like so much of rock music is derivative and boring.
There's still not as many women in music as men, and I don't really know why. I don't have the answers. I do wish there were more women that played music.
