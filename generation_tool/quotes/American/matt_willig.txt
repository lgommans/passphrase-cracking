I grew up knowing I would be good at athletics, and dreams of a Super Bowl were always within reach as long as I progressed.
It's funny, because athletes want to be rockers and vice versa.
When I was at USC, I did a movie with somebody, and I had a blast doing it.
The longer and longer I played in the NFL, I kind of said, 'Well, I'm not going to go out and get a 9 to 5 job at any point soon, so what can I do?' So I started hosting radio and TV shows while I was still playing.
