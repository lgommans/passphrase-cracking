I'm pretty convinced there's a chemical reality to who I am, regarding my brain, that makes me kind of a strange guy.
I always remember responding very emotionally to film. I had a lot of lonely time on my hands because I wasn't really the best-looking kid in my town and I sort of pined after girls. I had to sort of immerse myself in the arts because girls weren't particularly interested in me.
There's no doubt that there's certain songs and arrangements of music that release a chemical reaction in my brain. This sounds a little goofy, but I really believe that. It's such a euphoric experience that I sort of want to chase that experience as often as possible.
I was called McG since the day I was born because we were broke and there were three Joes in the house.
I don't think 'This Means War' is an appropriate picture to do in 3-D.
I'm just a tiny person from a humdrum neighbourhood, so I grew up worshipping 'Bond' pictures and dreaming of a life bigger than my own.
I strive to make movies I would enjoy.
I love British voicing and British humour in general. I'm a huge Ricky Gervais fan.
I hate my name. It's a stupid, horrible name.
I've always maintained my name will not define my films, my films will define my name. But I wish I was called Steve, or something else.
The one thing I'm proud of as a filmmaker is that people are entitled not to like my films - that's the privilege of the public - but I think I have my own imprint.
