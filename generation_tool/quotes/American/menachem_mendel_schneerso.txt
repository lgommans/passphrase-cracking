This is the key to time management - to see the value of every moment.
You cannot add more minutes to the day, but you can utilize each one to the fullest.
So during those first moments of the day, which are yours and yours alone, you can circumvent these boundaries and concentrate fully on spiritual matters. And this gives you the opportunity to plan the time management of the entire day.
When you waste a moment, you have killed it in a sense, squandering an irreplaceable opportunity. But when you use the moment properly, filling it with purpose and productivity, it lives on forever.
Before the day begins, you are not yet engaged in any physical activities. And it is only physically that you are constrained by the limits of time and place; mentally, there are no such boundaries.
And how can you achieve such concentration? By recognizing that everything you do is important to God, and is one vital piece of the larger picture of your life.
Without question, the material world and your everyday needs distract you from living meaningfully.
Not only will this make you treat each moment more preciously, but you will be more patient with yourself and with others, recognizing that there are millions of moments on the path to any worthwhile achievement.
But time is yet another of God's creations, and as such, it has a life of its own.
We have been conditioned to see the passing of time as an adversary.
We are always rushing to an appointment or trying to meet a deadline.
