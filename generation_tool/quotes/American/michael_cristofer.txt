American,Playwright
I'm totally unpredictable and never do anything consistently.
I don't think I can do anything. I mean, I felt I had been given a bit of a gift and a key to a kind of a future. But I've always felt there is more that I can learn and that there are many people who are as good as, or better at, what I do than I am.
Suddenly I was writing a lot of screenplays, and I was no long in New York, so I stopped acting in plays, and it just became too tricky to find a part to play, either in a play or a film that coincided with my schedule writing and or directing.
I guess the first screenplay of mine that was done was 'Falling in Love' with Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep.
I don't have a game plan. I have no idea what I'll be doing next.
