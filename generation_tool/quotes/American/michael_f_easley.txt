Early college high schools in North Carolina and across the country show us that challenge - not remediation - is an approach to education that works.
I had hoped to let the one-half cent sales tax sunset this year, but we do not believe revenues will grow as fast as we hoped for the rest of the year.
We must remember that North Carolina is more than a collection of regions and people. We are one state, one people, one family, bound by a common concern for each other.
Real vision demands that we make tough choices. Real vision is responsible and it is paid for.
As you may know, previously as Attorney General and now as Governor, I have supported legislation to close the gun show loophole in North Carolina.
As Governor of North Carolina for two terms, I made improving education a top priority.
Because education is the backbone of a competitive workforce and successful economy, making it a priority is not uncommon.
