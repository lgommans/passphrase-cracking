I have way too shady a background to get into politics. I was a crazy kid - I was in bands, and I don't think I'd get very far before people started digging up stuff I didn't want them to see.
I had actually studied political science in college. I had dreams of being a lawyer at one time.
Yeah, I probably got in too much trouble as a youth to be a politician.
If I get one more person telling me I look like Eliot Spitzer, I'm just going to have to play the guy one day.
I play guys who never smile, and I never stop smiling.
People always ask me, 'Hey, what's Matt Damon like?' He's just a dude, just a really good person and one hell of an actor.
I was in college, and I studied everything, but was really not good at anything until I found philosophy, and, then, political science. I thought, 'Wow, this is something I really enjoy.' I kind of got into that whole world of law and political science. I was really into it and enjoying it, and then I took an acting elective, and that was it.
In the beginning, I aspired just to make a comfortable living in acting. I still feel the same - it's just that my standards have gone up, so my comfort level is higher as well.
