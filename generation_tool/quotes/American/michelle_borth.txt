There's nothing - there's nothing - as action-packed as 'Hawaii Five-O.'
I like to hang with the boys and I like to prove that I can be one of the boys, if not better.
Acting in TV as opposed to films is really difficult. What a film gets two months to do, we get eight days to do.
I have so much respect for television actors and directors. We're on set doing 16-hour days, and that's just what we do.
