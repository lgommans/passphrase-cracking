Change is unavoidable. You change either to stay ahead or to catch up.
The effort required by your endeavor now is not as hard as dealing with your regret later.
You don't get results by focusing on results. You get results by focusing on the actions that produce results.
If you choose not to pursue your dreams, you'll still be a part of a dream - only it will be someone else's.
Goals seem impossible only when you are not heading toward them.
When you can't stop what you're doing long enough to improve it, you will never stop what you are doing.
Your desired behavior must become just as much a habit as your undesired behavior was before.
