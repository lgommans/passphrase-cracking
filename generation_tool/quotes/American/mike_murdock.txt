The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine.
Each relationship nurtures a strength or weakness within you.
You will always move toward anyone who increases you and away from anyone who makes you less.
You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.
You will only be remembered for two things: the problems you solve or the ones you create.
Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.
