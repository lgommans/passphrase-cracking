American,Actor
I'd love to hold a koala. They sleep 22 hours a day, eat eucalyptus leaves and just hang out. I want to spend some time with that guy.
My sisters and mom raised me to respect women and open doors for them.
Sometimes I'm an ass, sometimes I'm sweet as peaches.
You have to pay attention to the work on the page and make it as good as possible because it could be your last.
Enjoy every moment.
I'm tough on the outside and soft on the inside... I'm really a shy guy.
I'm a homebody, I'd rather be in the kitchen cooking than hanging out in a bar.
I'm happy to be on a show that's bridging that gap of 'Okay, I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm a man.'
I was used to playing misled youth, rough-and-tumble guys. It was nice to get back to a big-hearted, warm and gentle soul, a guy who is destined for something a lot larger than he ever expected.
I just try not to subscribe to the ways of celebrity. I'm not a celebrity, I'm a working actor. A lot of the events - the parties and the premieres that people go to to get noticed - I'm just not into. I'll hang out with my friends, go see punk shows, read at home. At the same time, I have a production company, which is a lot of work.
