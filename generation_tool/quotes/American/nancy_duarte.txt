To me, presentations are the most powerful device. You can't really name a movement that didn't start with the spoken word.
My best advice is to not start in PowerPoint. Presentation tools force you to think through information linearly, and you really need to start by thinking of the whole instead of the individual lines.
Some people rehearse to a point where they're robotic, and they sound like they have memorized their presentation and didn't take it to the next level. Going from sounding memorized and canned to sounding natural is a lot of work.
Phrases that have historical significance or become headlines don't just magically appear in the moment. They are mindfully planned.
The future isn't just a place you'll go. It's a place you will invent.
Most presenters are consumed with preparing their content rapidly, which makes the material about their own narrow perspective.
Words that are carefully framed and spoken are the most powerful means of communication there is.
Your ability to shape your future depends on how well you communicate where you want to be when you get there. When ideas are communicated effectively, people follow and change.
