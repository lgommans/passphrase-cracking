I'm a perfect example of the grumpy, old man. I'm really good at it.
I've had this problem since I was in my 20s. They don't call it manic depression anymore. They call it a bipolar disorder, and I'm a Type 2.
I only really work when I want to.
I'm getting grumpier all the time.
I was born just barely south of the Mason Dixon line.
I'll tell you what I would do in a shot if I could. I would sing in the barbershop quartet in The Music Man.
I'm blessed with eight children - though I'm talking about eight adults now.
I want to see the writers strike because the writers, god bless them, are the only true commies we have in Hollywood.
It always impresses me when a person of small stature has command.
