To me, having kids is the ultimate job in life. I want to be most successful at being a good father.
She knows I'm her biggest fan, I cheer for her louder than anybody.
We have so much left to experience and learn about each other - it's almost like we've been remarried with the show being over. Now it's a whole new life for us.
Marriage is a team effort. Both of us share that philosophy.
I tell her all the time I'd gladly retire and hang out with the kids and clean the house. I want to have a good life and great family, and from a professional standpoint I want to be successful, but it's not the most important thing at all.
There's a lot of reflection that goes on whenever I write a song - it's been a wild whirlwind last couple of years and there's a lot to talk about, and hopefully that's evident in the music.
We can't control it, and we've basically quit trying. People are going to talk, and people are going to lie.
I try to be the best husband I can be, and if people respect that, that's cool. But there's no 'perfect husband.' We just all try to do the best we can, you know what I mean?
We live in a bizarre world - there are cameras in our house!
I tell people, Don't take my advice. What do I know?
There's no bigger supporter in Jessica's life than me.
Her success is my success.
This is a great time in our lives and careers.
It all comes back to the same place, whether she does well, I do well, or we both do well, which is obviously what we're hoping for. It's all good. You know? We're definitely pull for each other.
We're planning on being married for a long, long time.
I always feel stupid giving advice since I've been married, what, a year? I can say this: Be in it for the long haul and just know there are going to be rough patches. No two people are the same, there are going to be areas where you just don't click.
