New Orleans is kind of dark in a very beautiful way.
I was a huge bookworm, total nerd, so I was a victim in middle school. I was in three academic clubs, so I was an easy target.
I always think of young Hollywood as its own little high school. There are the girls who have been working for a while that are kind of like the Queen Bees and the new kids at 'school' just starting out.
My best friends are just girls who go to school. They're not in the industry, and we have dinner nights and learn how to cook together and go on hiking trails and the beach.
