American,Actor
In the modern world there's no such thing as formality. A dinner jacket used to mean a tuxedo, you know?
That's the weirdest thing about television for me is that you're getting feedback in the middle of the work.
A movie set or any set is a completely private place and it feels very insulated.
I did do a war movie, 'Windtalkers.' That was a lot of action. But once you've done one big action/war movie, you don't need to do another one.
My brother started in the music business, and I was an actor - we were both in the entertainment industry, but doing separate things. Then he went over to New Line and started their soundtrack department, that's how he got his foot in the door.
After every movie, you get offered the role that you just did in the last movie.
Some of the things I've been in are comedic, but I don't get considered for true comedies because I'm a 'dramatic' actor.
I'm actually pretty scientifically interested. I have a lot of friends who are doctors, so the idea of the virus and the synapses in the brain and how the nervous system works was actually all pretty familiar to me.
I'm not really a zombie genre guy; I'm not particularly versed in it. Doing 'The Walking Dead' sort of turned me on to the whole thing.
It seems like the more I live, the more I realize that saying 'yes' is almost never a mistake. If you say no, it might feel safe, but then you end up going nowhere.
