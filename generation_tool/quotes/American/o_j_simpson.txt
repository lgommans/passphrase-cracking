The day you take complete responsibility for yourself, the day you stop making any excuses, that's the day you start to the top.
If there wasn't no fight, there wasn't no weekend.
I'm absolutely, l00 percent, not guilty.
I didn't beat her. I just pushed her out of bed.
Money takes wings. The only thing that endures is character.
I don't know how often I can discuss one incident in my entire life, but I'll continue to do that.
I really have reached a point where I can write a book about all of this.
My NFL pension can barely pay my son's tuition. You know, it's very little money.
I've been very clear. I won. I didn't commit the crime.
I think I've been a great citizen.
Oh my God, Nicole is killed? Oh my God, she is dead?
I'm enjoying the money, the big house, the cars; what ghetto kid wouldn't?
I have always wanted to be liked and respected.
Nicole will come up in conversations where it's in a part of the conversation. Or we may be somewhere and I would tell some story about their mother and I. You know, we always honor her birthday.
What do you mean you have my children at the police station? Why are my kids at the police station?
I could not tell you the date of my mother's death. I could not tell you the date of my dad's death. These are not dates that I find significant.
I tend to watch a little TV... Court TV, once in a while. Some of the cases I get interested in.
I had one fight in my adult life. I had the famous '89 fight with Nicole, which she admits that she initiated the physical part.
I did not have anything to do with these murders. Ever.
