American,Actress
I've always been quite a happy person, but when I'm low, I'm pretty darn low.
I've worked very hard at understanding myself, learning to be assertive. I'm past the point where I worry about people liking me.
I was never the girl in high school who had a boyfriend for years. My longest relationship has been 18 months. I've thought maybe I'm really superficial and unable to have a relationship. What I've found is that people are attracted by my independence, and then they try to squelch it.
I'm not a comedienne. I'm an actress.
I need to end up with someone who is strong, intelligent, independent, someone I really admire - sensitive, sensuous, warm, a sense of humor.
I love to sing more than anything - more than acting, even.
I guess I don't believe that death is the end.
