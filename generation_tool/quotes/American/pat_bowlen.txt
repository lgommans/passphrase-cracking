I said publicly last year that I wanted 2012 to be a great season, not just a good season. We certainly had a very good season and perhaps exceeded a few expectations. But Broncos fans, you and I know what a great season looks like.
I don't do e-mails.
I have short-term memory loss. I know that some of the memories of the Super Bowl championships are fading.
I don't run the triathlons anymore like I used to. I do leg work on the machines and do the bike. I'm not as strong as I used to be, but I'm still good.
We haven't had the success we had hoped to achieve. Josh McDaniels is the head coach of the Broncos and you always strive for stability at that position. However, with five games left in the 2010 season, we will continue to monitor the progress of the team and evaluate what's in the best interest of this franchise.
