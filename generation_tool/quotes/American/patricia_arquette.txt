We all have our own little thing, I think.
I grew up in a hippie commune so I have a real hippie part of me.
I don't have a goal but I just want to work on movies that I really like.
I liked the premise of this material. I love the marriage relationship. They kind of keep each other honest, and they enjoy each other's sense of humor. Kind of a sexy but boring relationship.
Neither of us entered marriage thinking it wouldn't be a strain. Life has strains in it, and he's the person I want to strain with.
I find that men are far more vain than women.
You want your partner to objectify you.
I don't read my reviews, but I have a bunch of them and I will when I'm 80.
Hippy people had a hopeful idea of what they wanted the world to be like, then most of them changed into corporate Yuppies. But I still have that hippy thing underneath somewhere.
