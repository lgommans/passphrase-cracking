If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride - and never quit, you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards.
Show class, have pride, and display character. If you do, winning takes care of itself.
Don't give up at half time. Concentrate on winning the second half.
No coach has ever won a game by what he knows; it's what his players know that counts.
There's a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success.
I ain't nothing but a winner.
There's no substitute for guts.
Never be too proud to get down on your knees and pray.
Winning isn't everything, but it beats anything that comes in second.
In a crisis, don't hide behind anything or anybody. They're going to find you anyway.
A good, quick, small team can beat a big, slow team any time.
You never know how a horse will pull until you hook him to a heavy load.
It's nice to have the opportunity to play for so much money, but it's nicer to win it.
If anything goes bad, I did it. If anything goes semi-good, we did it. If anything goes really good, then you did it. That's all it takes to get people to win football games for you.
If you whoop and holler all the time, the players just get used to it.
There's no use fussing on a boy who doesn't have any ability.
