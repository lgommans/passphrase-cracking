I'm not big into images. I'm into reality.
Our focus continues to be on having the Saints in Louisiana... We're trying to develop what we would regard as a new model for the Saints to operate in a rebuilt Louisiana.
I think the preponderant opinion clearly was that St. Louis could be a great football city if it had a team of its own that they could really root for.
We're going to make every effort to keep the Saints as Louisiana's team.
