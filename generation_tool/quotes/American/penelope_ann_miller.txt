I look to longevity. I just consider myself an actress and getting good roles. If being a 'superstar' gets me good roles, then that's a positive thing. But my goal isn't just to be a superstar. It's to act for a long time.
The whole point is to hook people and keep them interested.
Luckily because I had a family and children, my priorities changed. I mean, I'm very passionate about my work but I have other interests and other things that balance my life.
Now with tabloids and seeing people walking around in sweats pumping gas you're like, 'Okay, they're just like us.'
Now I'm the go-to-girl for silent films.
I had a family, I had children, I got married. My ambition changed.
Harvey Weinstein bought our film, and he's an animal. He's got us out there campaigning and everything because honestly it's a silent black-and-white film.
The thing is, you don't want to overact or be full of yourself.
I did not get Botox because you wouldn't see any expression in my face. Hopefully it has paid off.
I don't want to work all of the time.
The film business has changed so dramatically from when I started.
If there's something decent going in television, the mediums now are kind of equal. Television has become much higher quality.
There are great characters on television.
I'm just looking for a kind of project that will have a decent role and is something that I'll really enjoy doing. There are a lot more opportunities in television.
