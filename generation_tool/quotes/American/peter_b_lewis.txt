American,Businessman
I really get a smile that people think they have a right to even suggest how I give my money away. I have no mandate to give a dime to anybody.
Seeing results flow from my gifts is my greatest pleasure as a philanthropist - whether exonerating a jailed innocent or completing a Frank Gehry building. I want to enjoy my philanthropy.
