My piece in One World or None was the description of the effect of a single atomic bomb on New York City.
Neither our oceans nor our radar nor our fighters can keep us intact through another major war.
We did not speak in terms of strategy, in terms of overall economies, in terms of production and territorial conquest. We spoke of the impact of the bomb on the homes and the hopes of men and women.
