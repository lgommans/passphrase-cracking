American,Politician
We need someone with proven conservative leadership experience, not entitlement, to be able to represent us and lead us.
I think the big thing is to talk about getting people working again and addressing the issues that are keeping small business from being able to grow.
I certainly don't want our nation to go into default, but at the same time, I'm very concerned about our ongoing debt problem.
My focus is on my constituents.
There certainly are some good aspects to Common Core.
