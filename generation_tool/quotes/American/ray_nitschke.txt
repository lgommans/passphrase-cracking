I think it was the preparation and every thing Lombardi represented, you know, about hard work and that every game was important. So when you get to the real important games, you were ready to go.
It was another day to go to work, and try to play and play well.
It was the character of the Packers, man. We played for sixty minutes. We let it all hang out. There was no tomorrow for us. We got the adrenaline flowing, and we just let it go, man.
I'm not a madman.
I lust love to play football.
I think the Lombardi teams enjoyed and wanted to get into the big games.
That's what you work all season for, to get into the playoff games, and you don't want to blow it.
Lambeau was always special, and so was Milwaukee.
Packer fans are nuts, man.
