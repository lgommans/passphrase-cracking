Live theatre provides a rush you can't get in film or television. But it is the TV and film work that offers the leisure to go off and do a play.
I became fascinated by the fact that you could translate written material into performance.
When I was a kid, they bussed us down to a screening of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' in an old theater, and it was just a great experience.
I went to college and studied writing, and I got involved in theater. It's always been my passion.
I like playing good guys.
I try to stay in the best physical shape that I can because I do most of my own stunts. It looks amazing if you can do it, but I don't advocate it because you always get injured.
