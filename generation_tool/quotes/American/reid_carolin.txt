I love 'Die Hard,' man. It's the best.
I lived job-to-job before 'Magic Mike.' It certainly has meant a lot to me from a financial standpoint.
I'm really obsessed with this idea that we're living in this environment where there's always magic around us that we are not perceiving.
'Magic Mike' is about guys learning that sometimes you can't control your life; you have to trust your intentions and instincts and let the road take you where it wants to go. It's about trusting that things will make sense when you look back, not when you look forward.
I hopefully try to find people and projects that my gut instinctively points me towards, and hope that there's some type of rhyme to them later.
A lot of my favorite movies come from nuggets of truth.
