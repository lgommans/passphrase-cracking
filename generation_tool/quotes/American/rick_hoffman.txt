At first I'm sort of answering everything the way you're 'supposed to' answer, and I lost a bunch of followers... I was like, 'What the hell is this all about? What is Twitter supposed to be about? If you're not answering your fans, then what's the point?'
My parents are always a great litmus test. Based on the amount of shrieks my mother gives when we're out in public, her constant shock when somebody comes up and says something nice.
I am not a cat lover. I am a dog lover - but I'm only a lover of hypoallergenic dogs.
The real, raw, driven-to-tears type scenes have always scared me since I was very young working as an actor. And to this very day, I get tremendously neurotic making sure nothing is forced or fake.
No matter what set she's been on over the last 12 years, my mother always finds a way to get in the way. Not in a bad way. Like, she once got caught on a law show I did called 'Philly' trying to take a picture - she was caught on-camera in the background. She does things like this.
'Breaking Bad' is one of my favorite shows of all time.
As actors, for the most part, there's that neuroses most of us possess where, in a day of watching, this character get killed off of this show, and that character get killed off of that show - one never knows.
I am deathly allergic to cats. I mean, I love all animals, but they're not my animal of choice.
