American,Coach
I am kind of the guy you'd expect to be driving an 18-wheeler through town.
I am like that guy on the 'Odd Couple,' and it is not the neat guy. I go into my room and find pieces of pizza under the laundry.
I am a big barbecue-sauce guy.
Nobody thought I would be a great coach.
I really never look at my health issues as 'Woe is me.' I've seen the reality of that. And it's not a pleasant thing.
Look, I haven't had hardly any bad luck. I never look at it that way.
It's good to be in on the action.
I've had opportunities. But I'm happy at Utah. I can do a lot of nice things and I love the kids. We work hard and we have fun.
I have friends in Utah who care about me as a person, not for what I am. They'll call to see how my heart is, how my blood pressure is. That's important to me.
One of the biggest reasons I like coaching college ball is the kids. I feel I can impact players' lives. I like the fact that they're student-athletes. I like to see those kids graduate.
Pro basketball is a very mercenary endeavor.
