You don't just wake up one day and decide who you are. I hope that people see that it's okay not to have labels nor label anyone else. Step back. We're all just trying to figure it out.
In my opinion, if you want to pursue an art, especially acting, you have to be really perceptive of what people go through. There is so much bad in the world, and I think that acting it out and exploring it almost helps you deal with it.
I think, as an actress, whether you want to or not, whether you're ready for it or not, people are going to look at what you're doing, and they are going to look up to you, and it's not even really about you; it's who you portray on the screen.
I'm actually not from the United States. I'm from Uzbekistan.
High school is such an awkward, difficult time, and I think a lot of people can't wait to explore the world because it's such a bubble.
I was a good student. I was lame. I was into school and didn't really go out much, so I guess I wasn't the coolest person on the planet.
I, as a fan of numerous TV shows and movies, know that people mess up. The characters that we love are not always going to act in the ways that we want them to. That's what makes them interesting.
Every good villain has his or her own vulnerability.
