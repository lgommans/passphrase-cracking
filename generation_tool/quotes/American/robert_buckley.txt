Next to hurting my family, cheating on me is the worst thing someone could do.
I like girls who are funny with a warped sense of humor.
I remember having friends in high school that did the theater department stuff, and I always wanted to try it but never had the guts to. I was the class clown but could never really build up the courage to try it. I took one acting class and really enjoyed it.
