I came from a good, repressed Catholic background.
I never planned any of this, so I don't even think about getting acting jobs. If they call, they call. I sure don't sit on the sidelines waiting to be asked, like a nice little Catholic girl at the dance. I keep myself extremely busy. I've written 91 plays! I love to read. And I always have something to clean.
I do most of my work on the stage, and typically once the show is over, it's over.
