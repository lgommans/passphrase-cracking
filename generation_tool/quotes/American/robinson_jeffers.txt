American,Poet
Imagination, the traitor of the mind, has taken my solitude and slain it.
Cruelty is a part of nature, at least of human nature, but it is the one thing that seems unnatural to us.
The love of freedom has been the quality of Western man.
Pleasure is the carrot dangled to lead the ass to market; or the precipice.
He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.
