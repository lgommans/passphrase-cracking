Why waltz with a guy for 10 rounds if you can knock him out in one?
I don't want to be remembered as a beaten champion.
In the ring, I never really knew fear.
What could be better than walking down any street in any city and knowing you're the heavyweight champion of the world?
I have always adhered to two principles. The first one is to train hard and get in the best possible physical condition. The second is to forget all about the other fellow until you face him in the ring and the bell sounds for the fight.
I was on my face. I heard the count from one to 10. I kept telling myself that I had to get up, but I couldn't move. I couldn't make myself move. It was the strangest feeling.
I believe, in my prime, I could have fought with anybody alive.
