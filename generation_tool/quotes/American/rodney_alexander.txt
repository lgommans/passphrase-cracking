American,Politician
I didn't have the base I needed to win the election.
I absolutely intend to return every penny given to me by my Democratic colleagues and Democratic leaders.
I knew that there were several, among African-American leaders, who had been put out by me because of my failure or reluctance to endorse Sen. Kerry.
I didn't want to engage in a campaign where I was defending myself on those issues at every turn, so I just decided that I'd switch and run as a Republican.
To be called a coward, I don't think that's fair.
We didn't do anything wrong... Some are frustrated that we did it this way.
