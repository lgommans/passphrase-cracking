Horse racing is animated roulette.
Football is violence and cold weather and sex and college rye.
I was showing early symptoms of becoming a professional baseball man. I was lying to the press.
Boxing is smoky halls and kidneys battered until they bleed.
Tennis and golf are best played, not watched.
You may glory in a team triumphant... But you fall in love with a team in defeat.
