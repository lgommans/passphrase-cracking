American,Businessman
I'm building a large company.
The skills I acquired in Southeastern Louisiana University, Thrifty Drugs, Pacific Mutual, along with knowing the history, behavior and local staff, helped make Golden Eagle a success story.
I like to play golf, but not at a country club.
I don't have a lavish lifestyle.
