American,Musician
At one time, I had it notarised that I was from another planet. By a lawyer.
I like the Sci Fi channel and 'Science Fiction Theatre.' I've been doing a lot of television-watching and thinking about good songs to write.
I had the 'War of the Worlds' comic book. I had lots of comic books.
I have Time Warner, and I try to relax a lot and watch television a lot and everything. I really enjoy that. Listen to the radio.
