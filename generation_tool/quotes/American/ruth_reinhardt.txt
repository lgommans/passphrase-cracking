Nobody would comment on what clothes male conductors wear. Or if they kind of put on some weight or something like that, and maybe their jacket is a little bit too tight. But if that happens to me as a female, then that's immediately pointed out.
I believe that for all of us, there was this one moment in our early life when we started being obsessed about music, somehow feeling how 'big' it is and is what it can give us. For me, this was when I got to be as a 9-year-old on stage, performing in Verdi's Otello in the children's choir.
That's really the Holy Grail of conducting: how to change the sound of an orchestra just with our hands alone.
Firstly, I think that now there are many young female conductors, but as it takes at least thirty years for a conductor to 'ripen/mature,' we'll only see them in 'top conductors statistics' in some decades.
I really love mountain sports, hiking, skiing, and I love to travel and get to know different places and cultures.
The most important thing as a conductor is that you have to want it. People will give you a million reasons why you shouldn't.
