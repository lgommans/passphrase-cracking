I started off as a journalist when I was young and I did not get paid unless I wrote three stories a day.
Even though 'Glee' is sometimes a hard road, I am very excited about writing a multi-year arc.
Well, I'm from Indiana. So to me when I was a little kid growing up, Cincinnati was the glamorous New York of it all.
When I was growing up my favorite show was 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show', and I loved all the stuff that Norman Lear did.
I think I have a pattern of nice and lovely and then dark and twisted.
Yeah, at home it's all moonbeams and puppy-dog tails, so I guess I do have a darker side - and I like writing about it.
I had been accepted to film school, but my parents couldn't afford it, and yet they made too much money for me to get a scholarship.
Tone is everything in TV.
Originally, 'Popular' was going to be a movie.
I have a maid.
I love crispy, cool sheets.
You know, I'm very particular about my sheets. They have to be one hundred percent cotton, with a high thread count. Only cotton. No flannel.
I've gotten death threats, yes. I have. I think anytime you shine a spotlight on homosexuality or minorities and you try and say they are as normal or as worthy as acceptance as others, the people who are on the fringe don't like that and they will come after you. And they have come after me.
