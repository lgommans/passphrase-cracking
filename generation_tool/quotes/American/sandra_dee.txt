American,Actress
Sometimes I feel like a has-been who never was.
Me, I'm good at nothing but walking on the set with a pretty dress.
I'm no genius, sure, but I'm no dum-dum.
I could run for Congress. Why not? Good heavens, if Ronald Reagan can be president, I ought to make a great secretary of the treasury.
I get terrible reviews, but there are people who like to see me in the movies, I guess.
The reviewers tear me apart. I bleed. I'm a favorite target. They go along for six months looking at movies, praying for rain, and then a new Sandra Dee movie comes out, and their eyes open, and they lick their lips. Before they've ever seen it.
I used to sign vouchers and sign-out sheets with 'Alexandra Dee.'
My first year and a half in Hollywood, I did three films. Then in 1959, I was in 'Gidget,' 'Imitation of Life' and 'A Summer Place.' After that, I was a star. It was fun.
I've always had a problem saying what I feel for fear of having someone dislike me.
In December 1988, my mother died of lung cancer. I died too. I couldn't function.
My mother fed me with a spoon until I was 6 years old.
