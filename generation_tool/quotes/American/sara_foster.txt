I know a lot of aesthetically beautiful women who are not nice people, and they do not come across as beautiful to me. I think the number one thing for beauty is a smile. I love a woman with a beautiful smile.
I think that everybody would love to play the bad girl, 'cause for most of us, it's a stretch.
I don't spend money on shoes. I don't spend money on my hair. I don't spend money on really anything except for my skin. I am obsessed with skin, and I have been taking care of it since I was 19.
I had bad skin as a teenager, and I spent all my money on facials and laser treatments and creams and cleansers and serums and all that. I wake up in the morning, and I'll cleanse with Cetaphil or a rose milk cleanser from Whole Foods. Then I use serum called DNA repair serum, and it's made by Raj Kanodia.
I think modeling is interesting because every season, what the modeling world finds beautiful changes. Like Kate Moss, she was 5'6" and was so thin and had no curves, and that was in for a while.
