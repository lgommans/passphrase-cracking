Life has loveliness to sell, all beautiful and splendid things, blue waves whitened on a cliff, soaring fire that sways and sings, and children's faces looking up, holding wonder like a cup.
Wisdom is not acquired save as the result of investigation.
I make the most of all that comes and the least of all that goes.
Beauty, more than bitterness, makes the heart break.
I found more joy in sorrow than you could find in joy.
A hush is over everything, Silent as women wait for love; The world is waiting for the spring.
When I can look life in the eyes, grown calm and very coldly wise, life will have given me the truth, and taken in exchange - my youth.
I have no riches but my thoughts. Yet these are wealth enough for me.
It is strange how often a heart must be broken before the years can make it wise.
Life is but thought.
Call him wise whose actions, words, and steps are all a clear because to a clear why.
No one worth possessing can be quite possessed.
There's nothing half so real in life as the things you've done... inexorably, unalterably done.
Oh who can tell the range of joy or set the bounds of beauty?
Of my own spirit let me be in sole though feeble mastery.
Though I know he loves me, tonight my heart is sad; his kiss was not so wonderful as all the dreams I had.
