American,Actress
I left home when I turned 17 and ran away to New York. I did a lot of moving. I was based in New York and country-hopping, so I was always 'the new girl'.
I didn't cheer in high school. I was the farthest thing from a cheerleader in high school. We made fun of cheerleaders. Everybody did!
I go through phases as far as working out goes. I'll do yoga for a few months or then work out at the gym, and then if I'm not doing either, there are things that I usually try and do something active, whether it's trying to jump in the ocean with the surfboard or go hiking.
I love jeans - I have so many pairs, it's ridiculous. I'm all about soft and comfy.
Acting, it's very different. It's obviously very different and a lot more difficult than the modeling world I came from.
I had friends who were actors. I had some close friends who are actors before I had fallen into it. And but I never approached anybody about doing it. But once I had been approached, I said, 'Sure and I'll give it a go.'
