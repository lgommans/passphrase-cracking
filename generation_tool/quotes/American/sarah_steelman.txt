American,Politician
Every day, President Obama and Senator McCaskill are making it harder for working mothers and women of all ages to find a good-paying job. They continue to dictate to our families how they should live, stripping them of opportunities and freedom.
Of course I am for stopping violence against women. It is unfortunate that the Senate Democrats are making the current re-authorization of Violence Against Women bill into a political football. The Republicans are offering an improved version of the reauthorization bill and I want to review it.
I want to do my part in fighting for America's future. That's why I have decided to run for the United States Senate.
Roy Blunt is another white guy in a suit, and I think the public wants change. There's a good old boys' network out there that's hard to penetrate... and it's not always in the best interest of the party or for conservative principles.
There are as many Democrats that are guilty as Republicans and their spending habits. And the fact is, is that Washington is just broken.
I am for lowering taxes.
I'm an economist by training. And I know that what works is a permanent increase in buying power.
Everything about Washington is inconsistent, because they say one thing and do another, which is what my opponent, Claire McCaskill, is very, very good at.
I'm a working mom. I've been working since I was 14 years old.
