American,Producer
You don't make movies to be art movies. You make movies that move you emotionally because if you're going to commit five years of your life to a movie, you need something to keep you going.
Passion moves freely across borders, speaks every language, and flourishes in every culture. The movement of passion is the most gratifying satisfaction in any moviemaker's life.
I don't worry about what everyone wants to see. I make movies that please a writer, director and myself. I always think there are enough people smart as me and sensitive as me.
