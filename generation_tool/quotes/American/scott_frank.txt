Early on, when I wrote 'Little Man Tate,' I got pigeonholed. Somebody said to me, 'You're not very dark,' and I had trouble getting certain kinds of jobs... and I learned very early that I didn't want to get pigeonholed as anything. And my next script was 'Dead Again.'
Thrillers have become all about technology and using technology. That seemed, to me, not so interesting.
For me, I really like the human drama embedded in a crime story, and I like the way European films do that.
I really care more about the human drama than I do the thriller stuff.
