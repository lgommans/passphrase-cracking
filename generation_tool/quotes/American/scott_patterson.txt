American,Actor
I think L.A.'s terrific. You fly an hour and a half and you're in the mountains in three feet of powder. I also think it's a much better city if you're working as an actor. If you're not working and you don't see your dreams coming true, there can be a lot of heartache.
I write a lot of music in my time off and I compose most of the songs on guitar. I've actually gone into the studio and recorded a few things, but it's tough trying to sell a song. It's all about finding that hook, that melody.
Popstars really draws you in. It's fascinating. It's interesting to watch people thrown together in that kind of a situation. Even if the egos weren't involved and they weren't trying to be world famous. It's the Real World, only better.
I never worked in a coffee shop and I don't drink coffee, so I never thought I would become a coffee pusher on TV.
Passion is the thing that sustains you in acting. If you're doing it for fame and money, don't even bother because it will never happen. The last thing I ever expected was to be paid for this.
My accountant worships me because I'm so cautious with my money.
I'd like to settle down eventually, but acting is emotionally draining.
In 10 different takes, you can do a scene 10 different ways.
I get bored very easily.
I throw the best parties.
