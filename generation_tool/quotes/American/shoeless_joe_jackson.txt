God knows I gave my best in baseball at all times and no man on earth can truthfully judge me otherwise.
I ain't afraid to tell the world that it didn't take school stuff to help a fella play ball.
When I was up there at the plate, my purpose was to get on base anyway I could, whether by hitting or by getting hit.
