Writing comes more easily if you have something to say.
The sword conquered for a while, but the spirit conquers for ever!
The lash may force men to physical labor, it cannot force them to spiritual creativity.
An illness is like a journey into a far country; it sifts all one's experience and removes it to a point so remote that it appears like a vision.
