With movies, it's 10 or 12 or sometimes even 24 weeks, if it's a massive movie, to live within a character. But with a show that's successful, if you start in the first or second season and go until the end, you're always finding new elements of your character that are being added in because you start to live in them as human beings.
The good thing about Twitter is that there's not so much of a wall between you and your fan base. They can interact with you, and it makes them more endeared to you when you interact with them. It's really fun in that way.

I fell in love with the art of acting back when I was 10 years old, actually.
I took a drama class in elementary school, and I just remember having so much fun with it. From there, I just studied, got better as I went along, and continued to grow.
I always choose music based on whatever the scene calls for, or whatever my mood is supposed to be.
The audience should go out and see 'Shark Night 3D' because you can bring your whole family.
