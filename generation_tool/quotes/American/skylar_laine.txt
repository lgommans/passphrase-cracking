American,Musician
I've taken singing lessons since I was young, just to work on technique.
I'm really good at solitaire and I can turn my arms in full circles.
I'm hoping to become a recording artist and make albums and go on tour.
On a personal note I want to gain more confidence and give back in any way I can.
I own now, I think about 38 pairs of cowboy boots, or 37, something like that now.
I won't be able to live without my guitar, my phone or my boots on tour.
