American,Comedian
The way I define what I do is, basically, I do whatever I want.
YouTube is the new TV. I'm the voice of the young people. I feel like kids these days don't watch TV anymore... No, I will never leave YouTube. Never ever ever... If I do, you can do whatever you want to me.
My goal before I die is to get all of my thoughts out.
I'm picking and choosing what I want to do.
I was a very quiet child growing up. I always knew that I was funny - I just never put it to use.
Comedy was something I picked up trying to perfect my art through spoken word. I got on YouTube just to show off my poetry, and then people thought I was funny, so I ran with it.
I went to L.A. and got an acting coach for one day. Then I went in to audition and I smashed it. You have to take risks, and one thing I know about people: your presence is everything.
