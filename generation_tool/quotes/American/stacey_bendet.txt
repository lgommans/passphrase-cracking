American,Designer
I think an important approach for designers to take is to have a very - not singular but focused point of view.
I love vintage shopping, but my secret spot for great tees and casual stuff is Trico Field. They have the cutest kids' clothes, too!
I walk to work, so boots are a staple for me.
My parents wanted me to go to law school!
Theory did a great work pant, and everyone was doing denim. But no one was making a trouser sexy, or the focus of an outfit... So, that's what I set out to do.
I think the more I learn, the more I see, and what you see makes your eyes and talent evolve.
A high heel elongates the leg and inevitably flatters every figure.
We're so known for our party dresses and evening looks, I wanted to focus on what the Alice + Olivia woman is going to wear tomorrow, during the day and on the weekend, in ways that are sort of fun and sexy.
I don't have a traditional design background, but it's inherent to me. My father was in the fabric industry, and even my grandfather and my great-grandfather were lace manufacturers.
Ever since I was a little girl, I loved to make things. I always made dresses for my Barbie dolls. When I was 13, I designed my Bat Mitzvah dress.
When I was in college at the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied international relations and French, I studied abroad in Paris for a semester. I think when you're there, you can't help but be immersed in fashion because it's such a part of the city.
I like to change outfits multiple times a day.
I love Brits! They are so full of energy and individuality. I am a fan!
I love creating and being able to see an idea come to fruition. I love making beautiful things.
