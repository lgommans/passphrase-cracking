The natural evolution of a well-educated populus is integration. And this is not political; it's not theoretical; it's not even partisan.
It's my constitutional right to have my choice of who I want to vote for for president.
I came across awful characters when I got some kind of status and came to Hollywood. Then you have directors trying to sleep with you, assuming that you will do things because of the way you dress.
I went to my last three years of high school in New Jersey. I just wanted to act, you know?
I went to a failing school, and by the grace of God, my mother was able to put me into private school, and had she not, I would probably be in a gang or dead right now, because that was the road I was going down.
The school system has become a part of this huge government machine, governed by people who aren't close to the situation. That's why I'm a Republican. I believe in small government.
The government is just too big, and we have to make it smaller; people are getting lost.
My main goal is to really make people think, and laugh while they do so.
I don't get celebrities not understanding that the paparazzi are doing their job.
We need to be united, and we all need to understand that we're all capable of achieving the American dream. And, but that has to be something that is self-realized. And also, to demonize someone for achieving the American dream is unfair.
I don't think the federal government should be a part of everything. I think that governing should be done state-by-state... so that you can tailor your governing to the people's needs.
