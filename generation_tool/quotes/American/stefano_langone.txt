The first thing you have to do is take everything with a grain of salt. You know, you've gotta just look at the goal, focus on what you gotta do and take one step at a time as a whole, as every performance being that's it, that's one objective, and let's just move forward and work on that.
If my life were a song the title would be 'The Comeback Kid.'
A million words were going through my head and honestly I didn't say one of them. I wanted to let it sit, simmer, you know I wanted to soak it all in - the moment was amazing.
But really it was just, it was perfect. You know, I actually got that feeling like you know what, maybe this is why I'm alive, you know - maybe this is why I'm here on this on earth.
I hope they see the genuine side of me, of my music, of my voice. I hope that they feel me. I hope that what I sing and what I say really gets across to the viewer because everything that comes out is true.
My favorite type of music to sing would be between R and B and opera.
