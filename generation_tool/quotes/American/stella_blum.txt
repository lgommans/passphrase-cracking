Fashion is a social agreement. the result of a consensus of a large group of people.
After World War II society had to settle back for a moment before it picked up the 20th century.
Fashion is so close in revealing a person's inner feelings and everybody seems to hate to lay claim to vanity so people tend to push it away. It's really too close to the quick of the soul.
