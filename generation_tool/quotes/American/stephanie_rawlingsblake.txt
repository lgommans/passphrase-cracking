American,Politician
I took on pension reform, health care reform, and leave reform - all of those tough issues that so many elected officials prefer to kick down the road to the next generation. But that's not who I am. I am not persuaded by what is politically popular but what is best for the citizens of Baltimore.
I haven't lost an election since middle school.
I don't hear a lot about elected officials that are men talking about whether they smile a lot. My dad was in elected office my entire life. I don't remember many smiles, and nobody commented about it. He was serious about his job, and so am I.
We need to focus on being one Baltimore.
I've been mayor for five years. I've led a city. And directed a police department. I know how to use resources.
