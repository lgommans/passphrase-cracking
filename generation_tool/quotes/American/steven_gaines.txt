You know what we say in the Hamptons: If you have to come out on a Friday afternoon or go back on a Sunday night, you're not rich enough to have a house there. So, you have to be able to come and go when you feel like it in the Hamptons.
There are many, many pricey streets in the Hamptons. There's South Hampton, Bridge Hampton and East Hampton, the three major towns. East Hampton has the largest selection of celebrities.
Martha Stewart has two houses in East Hampton. She has an old fashioned Victorian house and a very new modern house.
It's just as easy to buy a $12,000 watch in East Hampton as it is to pick up a carton of milk, and new homeowners are so impatient that they landscape their front lawns with 'mature gardens' of full-grown trees.
I'm surprised how easily Don Imus came back. He was off the air for a little while after the 'nappy-headed' comment in 2007, and then he's back as strong as ever.
There are some things that other people just don't want to forgive you for. For instance, Woody Allen and Soon-Yi.
