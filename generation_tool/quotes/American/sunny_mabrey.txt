Being in front of the camera was like coming home. The first time I saw myself on the big screen, it was in a trailer for 'The New Guy', and I just started screaming.
I've always loved the rush you get from watching a really scary movie, but I never watch them alone. It's fun to turn out the lights and scream and clutch someone's hand and spill the popcorn all over the place and hide under each other.
I think of myself as a Hollywood hillbilly, but I'm sick of all these questions people ask about Alabama. 'Do you have an outhouse?' 'Is there a lot of inbreeding in your family?' They think all Southerners don't have computers and TV sets and that we're all still living in 1862.
I went a little nuts in my twenties, but I just turned thirty and I feel, like, older now.
I'm in a band, and we play music. And that's sort of my way of still being a rock star.
It was really weird for me filming in New York, because I was born and raised there. I started acting and modeling when I was five or six, so I worked there.
I went to Paris when I was about 18 and then went to Miami and New York. I did all of that alone. I did it to myself.
I want to do more comedy... I've done a couple TV shows that had some comedy going on.
