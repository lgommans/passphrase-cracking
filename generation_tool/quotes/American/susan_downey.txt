American,Producer
As a producer, you're there from the inception of the concept to the delivery of it. It just takes so much energy.
I was never a girl who thought about getting married. Being in a relationship wasn't my priority.
If there was no Hollywood, no next movie, no deal at Warner Brothers, no place in Malibu or Venice, I would still be really happy.
I was very focused, driven, rigid, work-oriented. I didn't care about having a family or making a home. I didn't think about kids. It's not that I didn't want those things; I just didn't think about them.
I have no idea why, and this is others' observations of me - I tend to be in the realm of these very complicated personalities. I guess I enjoy corralling that.
I had no interest in really becoming an actress or doing that kind of thing... I just knew that I wanted to do something in making films.
