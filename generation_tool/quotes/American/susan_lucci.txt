American,Actress
You know what my greatest personal stumbling block is? My shyness.
Life goes on, and I'm moving on to the next thing, but I hope the soaps that are still running will thrive. They have millions of loyal viewers.
I love spaghetti and meatballs... I eat a lot.
I really always felt that I was going to be an actress. I had a lot of confidence in the fact that I would do well from a very early age. I didn't know how tough the business is.
My parents were both from extremely different backgrounds. My father's Italian, my mother was of Swedish descent. They're both first-generation Americans.
People always ask me, how do you do everything you do?
I am the luckiest actress on the planet.
I married somebody who is very secure. He's been in my corner from the time we met, and we grew in this together.
My grandsons really love my apple cake, which is from my grandmother's recipe.
It took awhile for me to get used to speaking candidly about my own life. I got into it, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.
Erica Kane was a spectacular role for any actress to play, and I felt so lucky to be the one who got to do it.
