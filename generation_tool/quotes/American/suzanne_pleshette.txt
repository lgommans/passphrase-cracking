American,Actress
I don't sit around and wait for great parts. I'm an actress, and I love being one, and I'll probably be doing it till I'm 72, standing around the back lot doing 'Gunsmoke.'
I'm an actress, and that's why I'm still here. Anybody who has the illusion that you can have a career as long as I have and be a star is kidding themselves.
Troy was a sweet, good man. We just were never destined to be married. We just didn't have the same values. But I'm not bitter. He taught me how to laugh.
Telephone operators have called me 'sir' since I was 6.
When I started in movies, they said I'd be this big star, but I was only a moderate one. Not enough good pictures. It's important to be in a good piece of work no matter the size of one's own part.
I work for wardrobe. Whenever I need clothes, I take a job. If I get maybe like six changes, then I'll be a grandmother, I don't care.
