American,Model
I was lucky to have been born with cheekbones.
I believe in the gold standard. I like solid lumps of things. You can always melt them down.
Sheer luck. I was lucky to have been born with cheekbones.
It's easy to be beautiful - just be born that way.
And I only do what I do in life, which is model.
