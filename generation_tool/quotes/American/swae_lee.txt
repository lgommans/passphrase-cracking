Imagine you're doing your thing, and somebody comes up to you and just kills your mojo. Just tell them, 'No flex zone!'
If you're taking care of yourself, then what can somebody else tell you?
I want to have a street named 'Swae Lee.' It doesn't need to be a busy street.
It's such a cycle. You'll see a rapper drop a song, and next thing you know, he's gone.
I'm probably going to forever be weird.
My first job was, like, McDonald's.
A 'no flex zone' is an area where a lot of people can be themselves, live their life, get their money.
I'll hear a beat and think, 'How can I make this a banger?' I'll write the lyrics on my phone or on a piece of paper, and either way, it's going to be a slapper.
Man, I listened Nas and B.I.G growing up. I listened to both of them when I was younger for sure.
I write a lot of rhymes, but I don't really end up using them a lot of times, and I end up just freestyling. I like to write music, though, more than I like to freestyle, to be honest.
A lot of people, they want you to be a one-hit wonder.
I feel like I've been out of high school forever. So I just read to keep my mind going.
