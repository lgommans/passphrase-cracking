You can be the best person in the league but if you don't win championships, something's missing.
I was always a big fan of waiting a year of two to groom an NFL quarterback; let him learn and mature.
There is no such thing as sportsmanship.
The one thing that scares me the most is failing. It scares me that one day I won't be at this level. But while I'm here and while I'm having success early, I'm trying to do everything to stay on this level.
I'm just trying to keep my mind and my body active. The tough part about it is that physically I'm sort of limited.
I can only work out for so long before I start to really feel the effects.
There's no doubt about it; playing football and how tough it is on the body afterwards.
I used to hear about guys who played saying how difficult it is getting up in the morning, and now I'm experiencing it; those same effects.
No disrespect to Kyle Orton, who's been solid and stable for both the Broncos and the Bears, but I think the upside for Tim Tebow is greater right now.
My mom still lives in Denver and some of my brothers are still in the area, so I still have strong ties there.
I did an internship with Mike (Shanahan) and the Redskins last summer and I knew after a week and a half that it wasn't for me. I think I knew that going in, but I wanted to make sure.
