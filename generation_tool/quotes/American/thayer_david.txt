American,Actor
I've played four characters now, my latest one being Sandor the gypsy.
With a recent birthday, I've been acting now for twenty years.
I'll often rush out from Dark Shadows, having made a 5.30PM appointment, working for a couple of hours.
Dan Curtis, our producer, has the idea that people like to see a stock company of actors.
I think we've established a convention on the show that allows us to do pretty much anything we want to.
There's a certain gravity in Stokes, due to the situations I have to handle.
As an actor, I was just satisfied to work.
I think I have between twenty and thirty commercials playing at present.
They tend to lay dormant for a while but often come back, and then the cheques come in!
Commercial jobs are pretty easily adjustable because they only take a few hours to complete, which is one of the reasons they are a Godsend to the actor.
