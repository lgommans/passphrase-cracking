American,Novelist
There are worse words than cuss words, there are words that hurt.
Women have the right to say: this is surface, this falsifies reality, this degrades.
The clock talked loud. I threw it away, it scared me what it talked.
And when is there time to remember, to sift, to weigh, to estimate, to total?
Time granted does not necessarily coincide with time that can be most fully used.
I know that I haven't powers enough to divide myself into one who earns and one who creates.
