God has been faithful time and again to surround me with people that sharpen me and that make me better.
I'll never be a non-stumbler. I'll be a forgiven stumbler, but never a non-stumbler.
I'm not going to put out a Christmas CD until it's coming out of me naturally.
During the holidays, everyone needs a break from studying for exams and Christmas shopping. I wanted to put together a diverse tour that rocks in many musical directions but always points to Christ.
I am passionate about God, about Jesus, and what His influences do to me.
I can't immediately get all this coverage when my record comes out. The way I sell gold and platinum records is by being on the road.
I just pinch myself, because I think if there's anything I can be proud of, I've survived success, which I think is difficult these days.
I think Christmas is about celebration and come on, on the inside everyone wants to dance.
Are you kidding? This is crazy, man. I thought I was Mr. Pre-Televised awards.
I want my music to be everywhere, I want it to be heard. I want to give people an opportunity to enjoy my music, and maybe even hear about this beautiful truth that's in it.
I wanted my new release 'Get Back Up' to benefit Haiti in their tragedy and I am blessed to use my music to help as your purchase becomes our gift.
I'm not the only person who has something in their life they can't control.
People love that you're human and that we're frail and we face the same situations. Honesty tends to communicate with people better than standing up there like you have an 'S' on your chest.
Selling millions of records is great, but at the end of the day it really doesn't bring peace.
