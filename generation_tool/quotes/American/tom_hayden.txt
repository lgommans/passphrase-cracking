The peace and justice movement has to expand and not run away from the plight of gang members.
I've written a book on gangs, taught a course on gangs at Occidental.
Why should American atrocities be merely unsettling, but a trip to Hanoi unconscionable?

The politicians of New York have everything that is necessary to make proper decisions and they will have to live with what happens afterwards. The worst scenario is the politicians covering their eyes and turning it over to the FBI.

Fonda was neither wrong nor unconscionable in what she said and did in North Vietnam.
