I just felt like there was a world of cartoon voices that had to be discovered by me.
You have to remember we're just performers, that we seldom have any kind of grasp on real life.
I seem to voice a lot of sweet, kind of dumb yellow characters for some reason.
He's not a child but he's childlike, he's not a grown up, he's not a kid, maybe he sounds like an elf on helium, we'll play with it.
People are always saying that I must have been the class clown, with all these voices. No, I was way too shy to be the class clown; I was a class clown's writer.
