It's all about having fun and smiling and shaking hands.
Me, myself, I was a part of gang bangin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I lived that life for real, so to talk about it was like a joke, you know what I mean?
I'm not about trying to be out here fighting and shooting, stabbing and, you know, all that crap, man.
But Freedom Strike was actually quite cool.
I mean I'll be retired from rap, so what I'll be doin' in rap will be for fun.
