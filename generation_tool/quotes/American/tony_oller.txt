My favorite parable for living a positive and influential life is the Golden Rule: 'Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.'
Always dream. Never give up!
I'm always on Netflix. They got 'Breaking Bad!' How can you say no to that?
I've learned the truth in these sayings: 'Luck is when opportunity meets preparation' and 'The right project will find you'.
I had my share of issues, but now, it's something that's made me who I am and no complaints.
Being from Texas, acting or music isn't really a thing to do.
I love country; I'm gonna do a country solo album at one point just 'cause. I'm a big fan of Keith Urban, Trace Adkins, Rascal Flatts, even though that's more pop. I grew up on country.
Always make sure your heart is bigger than your head.
Let's be honest, Netflix has stepped up its game up. It seems to have a lot more of an assortment of stuff.
I'm a quirky dude, man.
I stay in a lot.
I love pop and rap. Bringing those two worlds together is always fun.
Music is a big passion of mine, and to be able to do it on the side of acting would be amazing.
I write most songs randomly. They don't always deal with something I've been through but something I think is important to tell.
I call my fans 'friends.'
I'm very lucky to be doing what I'm doing, and the reason I'm doing everything is because of fans.
I don't know if it's embarrassing, but I have a lot of girl Christian music.
