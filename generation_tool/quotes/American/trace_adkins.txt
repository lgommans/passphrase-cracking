If I feel like doing something, I do it. If I feel like saying something, I say it. If I feel like dancing, I do. If I don't, I don't.
I don't do the same show on any two nights.
It's great to be able to get up there now and do an hour or 75 minutes of songs they're familiar with.
People get passionate about a song. It's been my experience if you put out radio candy, something commercial, it doesn't sell records.
I only record songs that I really like and believe in and can sing with conviction.
New York City is a notoriously hard market to perform country music in.
