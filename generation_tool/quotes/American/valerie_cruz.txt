With 'Nip/Tuck,' I had never even done anything before I got on that show. They created that character for me. I was reading for something else.
I eat tons of green veggies to keep my PH balance in check.
The best thing I've learned is that you have to listen to your body, and you have to be your own physician. Don't ignore those little groaning aches and pains.
