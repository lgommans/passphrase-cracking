I enjoy getting dressed as a Barbie doll.
It's not the most intellectual job in the world, but I do have to know the letters.
I think people think of me as this elegant person because they always see me dressed up.
I'm really just a normal person.
I do everything that everybody else does.
I have a family and two cats; I get up with my kids early in the morning.
When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off.
There's five cameras, I don't know how many people in the audience... depending on where we're taping, there can be anywhere from 300 to 5,000 people, so the contestants are nervous.
So, I understand when they make a mistake and everyone at home is throwing their shoe at the television set.
I feel for the players.
I will say I remember the best thing in terms of publicity was being on the cover of Newsweek.
I'm a mom, a full-time mom when I'm not taping. I do the carpool thing, and bake the cookies, and do the homework.
