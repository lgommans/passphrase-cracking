American,Politician
My kids have played sports all their life, and one thing I've tried to teach them when you lose, you try to be a gentleman about it.
Anytime you have a tight race and you lose, it's not pleasant.
I'm going to reach out to everybody, Democrat, Republican and independent. I'm going to work with all the people in the district, and whether they're an 'R' or a 'D' doesn't matter.
