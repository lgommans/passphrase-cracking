American,Musician
In my opinion I do not think I am a better guitarist than Ace, I honestly think we're both different, and we both brought something unique to the musical.
I have no plan to retire anytime soon, although remember I am 50 years old!
I also plan to release a ballads collection.
I hope to find the perfect band as well, I really do, and I'm working very hard to find that band.
I agree with you about the music of today. It lacks style and emotion.
I miss the 80's as well, it was a truly great decade for music.
Soon I will be doing what I love again.
