American,Comedian
My mom didn't let me play video games growing up, so now I do. Gaming gives me a chance to just let go, blow somebody up and fight somebody from another dimension. It's all escapism.
Theatre sports is the best improv training period.
Cancelled isn't a bad word because it happens everyday.
I was teased horribly as a child and beaten up a lot.
I didn't know that I could do a talk show. I didn't know that we could bring variety to daytime. I didn't know that people wanted to see singing, and dancing and comedy in the morning.
I'm an actor first and foremost, who happens to do improv. I've also done sitcoms, I've done stage.
I always thought that common sense would prevail. But on a game show, there is no common sense.
I like to be left alone when I'm not working.
Work is the thing that happens around the game time.
I want the single player experience.
