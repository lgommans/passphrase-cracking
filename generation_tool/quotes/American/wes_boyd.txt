The Democratic Party had no idea how to use the Internet. They treated it like free money and then kept on doing all the rest of the things they normally do.
The party currently is about fund-raising and occasionally blasting out ads.
The party has to be much more. It has to connect in a real way with rank-and-file members and be their voice.
I actually think that one of the most dangerous phenomena is the bowing to expertise, whether it's in international relations or how to use technologies.
