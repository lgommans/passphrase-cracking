When you have a movie about people landing from planet Neptune, you suspend disbelief. I totally get it. But I like doing things that happen in real life.
I don't like having characters as props. I never want a character to be a prop.
I like to deconstruct things, deconstruct genres and stories.
I like doing character movies. I like doing movies about personal situations; that's what I love about dealing with things.
I like doing movies about personal situations; that's what I love about dealing with things. I don't like superhero things, I like real-people things.
I try not to read the Internet because it's mostly just a sea of hatred.
