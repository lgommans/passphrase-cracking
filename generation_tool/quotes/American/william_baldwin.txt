In terms of instilling the values of mental toughness and work ethic, discipline is the gift that keeps on giving.
A strong economy causes an increase in the demand for housing; the increased demand for housing drives real-estate prices and rentals through the roof. And then affordable housing becomes completely inaccessible.
A community is a group of people who have come together, and they work and they live to try and improve the standard of living and quality of life - and I don't mean money.
I love to utilize my celebrity status in a responsible and constructive and substantive manner. I like to get my hands dirty rather than a photo op.
Acting is my career and activism is my passionate hobby. But acting is my livelihood.
I was an activist long before I even entertained the possibility of being an actor.
I could count my modeling jobs on my hands and toes. When I graduated from college, I moved to New York specifically to study acting, and I needed to pay the bills, and it's better to make a couple thousand dollars in one day than to wait tables six days a week.
I look for an interesting and often times, fresh character. Something different that what is done all the time or than I've done recently. I look at who is directing.

I always equate wrestling to having been in the Marine Corps.
Wrestling is a team sport, and an individual sport all rolled into one.
When I wrestled in College, my team was very good.
