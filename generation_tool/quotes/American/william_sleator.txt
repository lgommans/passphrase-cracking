American,Writer
I can't write every day. I have to skip a day in between. If I try to do it every day, nothing comes.
I think about my audience when I write, to some extent. Thinking of writing for young adults, I try to keep the stories moving, never a dull moment, to hold their interest.
I've always been interested in both writing and music. When I first started getting published, I also worked as rehearsal pianist for the Boston Ballet, touring with them all over the U.S.A. and Europe - I wasn't making enough money from writing to support myself.
Stories develop from things I read and also from my own experiences and experiences of people I know.
