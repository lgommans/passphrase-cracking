Mexican,Architect
I don't divide architecture, landscape and gardening; to me they are one.
A garden must combine the poetic and the mysterious with a feeling of serenity and joy.
I think that the ideal space must contain elements of magic, serenity, sorcery and mystery.
Architecture is a art when one consciously or unconsciously creates aesthetic emotion in the atmosphere and when this environment produces well being.
My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience.
Life deprived of beauty is not worthy of being called human.
Beauty is the oracle that speaks to us all.
It is essential to an architect to know how to see: I mean to see in such a way that the vision is not overpowered by rational analysis.
