Argentinian,Statesman
Shadows cannot see themselves in the mirror of the sun.
I am only a sparrow amongst a great flock of sparrows.
Time is my greatest enemy.
One cannot accomplish anything without fanatacism.
When the rich think about the poor, they have poor ideas.
In government, one actress is enough.
I demanded more rights for women because I know what women had to put up with.
Keeping books on social aid is capitalistic nonsense. I just use the money for the poor. I can't stop to count it.
My biggest fear in life is to be forgotten.
I know that, like every woman of the people, I have more strength than I appear to have.
Charity separates the rich from the poor; aid raises the needy and sets him on the same level with the rich.
I will return and I will be a million.
I will come again, and I will be millions.
Where there is a worker, there lies a nation.
Answer violence with violence. If one of us falls today, five of them must fall tomorrow.
I am my own woman.
Suffer little children and come unto me.
To convince oneself that one has the right to live decently takes time.
If I have to apply five turns to the screw each day for the happiness of Argentina, I will do it.
I am only a simple woman who lives to serve Peron and my people.
The nation's government has just handed me the bill that grants us our civil rights. I am receiving it before you, certain that I am accepting this on behalf of all Argentinean women, and I can feel my hands tremble with joy as they grasp the laurel proclaiming victory.
I had watched for many years and seen how a few rich families held much of Argentina's wealth and power in their hands. So Peron and the government brought in an eight hour working day, sickness pay and fair wages to give poor workers a fair go .
