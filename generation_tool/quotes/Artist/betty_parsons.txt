American,Artist
Every time I learn a new thing to do on my computer, I have to write it down so that I can remember it.
I've been working in sculpture and painting since 1920.
We are born in the world because we have to learn something through whatever we're born into. Although it might be awful. That's why it's an illusion to think that we really run our lives. We don't.
I married a man who was jealous about everything. If I got enthusiastic about a book, about a flower, about a place, about a human being - jealous. 'Don't do it! Stop.' It was depressing, and I couldn't take it.
There are three things we have no control over: our birth; our emotions, if we're sincere; and our death.
My reputation was built on hostility. I had no friends and some very virulent enemies in the old-guard art scene when I began. They threw their heavy artillery against me. They were convinced I was perverting the public taste.
I'm so American that I had grandfathers who actually fought a battle against each other.
My husband wanted me to be a typical socialite. We never agreed on anything, so finally we decided it wasn't going to work.
A lot of artists fell in love with me over the years.
I've been using a computer for quite some time, and I don't understand everything.
