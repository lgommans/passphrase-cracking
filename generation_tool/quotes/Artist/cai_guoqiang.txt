Chinese,Artist
For an artist, a good place to be is you have some kind of influence and power to get things done, but in your essence you remain a nomad or a soldier facing a difficulty to be overcome.
Even though Chinese society was really closed, there were two windows for me to explore the world. One was from my mother and grandmother, the unseen and invisible world. Another window was brought from my father's side, those classic and Western books.
My work is like a dialogue between me and unseen powers, like alchemy.
When I was young, I didn't want to do traditional painting and calligraphy. I deliberately wanted to separate from my father so I could feel I existed myself.
Computer animation is one way to liberate people from their circumstantial gravity, and it is one way to give them mental freedom.
In any country, in any city, there will be political influence on what is said, what kind of images are to be projected and, yes, of course artists can be and are influenced by politicians.
I have always been a coward as a child. I am not very brave. I am very aware of the fact that I am not very gutsy.
