American,Artist
When I was four years old, some friends of my family took me to see 'Fantasia' and I was totally blown away. From that minute on I wanted to be an animator.
I learned how to do stop-frame animation and I experimented with that a lot, and pretty much that was my mode of animating through high school.
Anyone having to do with medicine will have looked at Frank Netter's art work... I decided I would make him my model... getting my degree in medical illustration and then going on to medical school.
