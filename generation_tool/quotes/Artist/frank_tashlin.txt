I got into a fight with Walt Disney: I always pick the wrong people to fight with.
That was the big secret. Walt would do things over and over again, with no regard to money, to get things perfect.
There's always been some moron-who usually went by the name of 'producer' - who would have to justify his existence, and interfere.
