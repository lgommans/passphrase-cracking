Italian,Artist
Rome is the city of echoes, the city of illusions, and the city of yearning.
Every painting is a voyage into a sacred harbour.
The sincere friends of this world are as ship lights in the stormiest of nights.
Take pleasure in your dreams; relish your principles and drape your purest feelings on the heart of a precious lover.
The human heart is as a frail craft on which we wish to reach the stars.
