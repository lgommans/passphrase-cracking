British,Artist
One minute I was completely unknown, barely able to feed my family, living on pennies. The next minute, Katie Couric was interviewing me on the breakfast show.
I had never read in public, never given an interview. I was doing it all and trying to produce the next book and raise three young kids and had another child on the way.
I do what I want to do. I see where my enthusiasm is. Over the years, my techniques expanded. That's how the writing came out.
Growing up in England, people told you why you couldn't do things. Suddenly, I had a publisher banging on my door, and was given the creative green light to simply make.
