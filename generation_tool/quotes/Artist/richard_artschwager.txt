American,Artist
My most important quality or property is curiosity. And that had its beginning in what I was going to do with my life.
I would wake up at night and think, 'What the hell have I gotten myself into? You don't want to do that!' But you gotta do something, and with art, there's freedom - which is actually very seldom practiced by artists.
The drawing is already partly there - it's in the paper. And the paper is talking before you do.
There isn't any art until some creature sees and consumes it. And has a reaction.
