To me, spending your life doing what you love is a gift. Everyone enjoys different walks of life, so find what you love to do and try to make a living at it.
Why would anyone want to be famous, certainly not me. My only goal in an acting career is to be able to work full time as an actor, filmmaker. When I get to that level, which I will, in this business where I can spend one hundred percent of my time honing my craft, then I will be complete.
