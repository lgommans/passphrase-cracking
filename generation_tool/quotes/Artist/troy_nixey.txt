You can't really show people you can direct until you show them that you can direct.
I definitely have some ideas that perhaps people haven't seen before, so I look forward to putting those on film.
My aesthetic is I love anything in the late 1800s, early 1900s.
Maybe it's stupidity, but you just gotta jump into things. That's how I've gone through life.
We're not born stuffy and boring.
