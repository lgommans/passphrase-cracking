American,Athlete
I worked on a farm. Played ball and loafed along the fishing and swimming holes of the White River, and my boyhood was not a lot different from that of other youngsters.
I avoided as much work as possible in the classroom, but did all the work possible on the ball field.
There is one thing I can say about working in a steel mill. If it does not kill you, it will make a man out of you.
