American,Athlete
I'm far from a saint.
I am in the Chicago Carpenters Union. They are huge supporters of mine and of MMA.
I consider myself a very driven and intense fighter.
You're speechless sometimes when you think of the support you've had from the first day I've started wrestling to now.
Most of my fights, I push the pace. I'm the aggressor.
