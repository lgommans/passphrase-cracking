Canadian,Athlete
You never know what you're going to get as a receiver.
As long as I have the support and respect of my teammates, that's all I can ask for.
I feel fortunate that there was a place like the CFL where I could hone my skill and become a consistent football player and have a nice career.
I obviously have a lot of love and affection for the people of Hamilton from playing there for so long.
In the NFL, every practice could make or break you. If you dropped one ball, you'd worry about getting cut.
I think the Canadian Football League is a great league, but it's not the NFL, and I'm not Jerry Rice.
I was a borderline guy in the NFL.
The opportunity to go up to Canada and play was just a blessing for me and my family.
We knew the people in Natick and knew the teachers that would be teaching our children. It was important for us to be involved in the Natick community because we think so highly of it.
When I retired in 2002 I had retired to stay home with my family and didn't necessarily think my playing days were over.
