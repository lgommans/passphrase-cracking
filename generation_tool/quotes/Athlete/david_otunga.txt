American,Athlete
I'm always trying to push the envelope and go with a different hairstyle that you're not going to see on anybody else. I have a really good grade of hair, and I can do a lot of different things with it.
People want to know more about me. They want to know who I am.
When I look someone in the eye, they are immediately smitten with me.
I'm one of those people who think I can learn something from everybody.
Ever since I was a child I always wanted to be WWE Champion. I've been in love with sports-entertainment for my entire life, and I always wanted to do that.
