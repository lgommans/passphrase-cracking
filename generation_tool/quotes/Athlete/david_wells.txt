I'm feeling pretty good right now, but I hope we can just win the whole thing and I can run off into the sunset and say good-bye.
I drank beer, and I had a career year.
There are guys in the game only because of steroids. They couldn't make it with their natural talent, so they had to enhance themselves. It sucks.
To pitch a perfect game wearing pinstripes at Yankee Stadium, it's unbelievable. Growing up a Yankee fan, to come out here and make history, it really is a dream come true.
I blame myself more so because I hung a curve. If you want to point a finger, point it at me.
I like the ball in a big game. I'm not afraid to take it.
I would have liked the old days.
I'm not even close to those guys, but I don't think anyone loves the game more than me.
I'm not going to make any excuses. I just went out and stunk it up tonight.
I'm not going to sit here and bash the manager, we have to regroup.
I'm not making any excuses. I got my butt kicked in certain games.
In my whole career, I've never seen this type of race that you had to wait for the last day. There's so many teams that are involved. You've got to smile because we're in it.
That's me, I'm emotional.
The game has changed. What's going on now is nonsense. You have guys complaining about not being paid.
The money is great, no way am I complaining.
We had a pretty good lead, so why push it.
If you are going to point a finger, you point it at me.
