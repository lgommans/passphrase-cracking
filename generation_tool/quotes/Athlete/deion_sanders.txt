American,Athlete
I'm married to football, baseball is my girlfriend.
I can really fish - I've been fishing since I was a kid.
Just think about the game. Think about playing great, having a great time. Helping my team win.
I always wanted to make sure my parents didn't have to work again for the rest of their lives.
I don't care what they say about me when I'm through with sports. I don't want to be known as anything else in life but a great father.
Athletes know kids look up to them, and it's important for athletes to be responsible.
Sure we're in limos. We're stars. How else is a star supposed to travel?
It's gonna be a lot of zeroes in that contract. You gonna think it's alphabet soup or something, all those zeroes in there.
I got my dog back, in African-American language, your dog means your passion, your fire.
I never wear the same shoe twice.
If I don't fish in the morning, I fish in the evening.
