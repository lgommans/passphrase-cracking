Sometimes a week might go by when I don't think about that game, but I don't remember when it happened last.
When it was over, I was so happy, I felt like crying. I wanted to win this one for Casey. After what I did in Brooklyn, he could have forgotten about me and who would blame him? But he gave me another chance and I'm grateful.
