Family is always the most important part.
I knew there were a lot of friends out there, and I wanted to be with them.
I like to cook good meals, especially when I have a lot of time.
I love that I have a job that I love.
I'm almost a full-time mom.
To come back on the ice was hard, and at the same time it was kind of a healing process.
