French,Athlete
Obviously, swimming is my strength, but I'm also good at fencing.
Fencing and shooting kind of came naturally. From the start, I knew that I had it in me.
Pentathlon is not a sign of my failure in swimming. It's a new start for me.
I'd like to do some modelling. But I will go on with pentathlon until the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
