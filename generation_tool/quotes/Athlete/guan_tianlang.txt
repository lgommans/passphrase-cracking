I like playing many other sports, such as basketball.
My biggest dream is to win four Majors in a year.
On a school day, I practice for two hours and more than half a day on weekends.
I started playing golf at about four years old.
The AAC is the best amateur event in the region and the most important tournament to me every year.
The experience at the Masters was two years ago, and I am eager to win again this year so I can return to Augusta National in 2016.
It is a lot of work when you have to go to school and then try to improve your game at the same time.
The AAC at Royal Melbourne was a wonderful memory for me. I had a slightly disappointing finish, but I gained a lot of experience by playing in the last group.
I want to win a major, and hopefully I can win the four majors in one year.
I hope I can make more miracles, more dreams come true.
