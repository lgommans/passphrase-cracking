Yesterday is a cancelled check. Today is cash on the line. Tomorrow is a promissory note.
You can't be fat and fast, too; so lift, run, diet and work.
There are few secrets in football. So execute.
I've lived a charmed life. I married the only girl I ever loved and did the only job I ever loved.
I always felt if you were going to be successful, make sure you get good people. You win with great players. Coaches don't win games. Players win games.
As I matriculate my way down the field of life, I will never forget this moment and you wonderful people who helped make this day possible.
My philosophy? Simplicity plus variety.
You can't win unless you have good people with great attitude. They are the ones who won the games. I didn't win any games. You never saw a coach make a tackle anywhere. My philosophy was to get the best players and then try to do something new with them.
The receivers are an integral part of the passing game.
The honor I feel today being inducted into the Hall of Fame is beyond what words can describe. My thanks to the Hall of Fame committee, who saw fit to bestow this great honor upon me today.
You cannot win if you cannot run.
When I have the urge to get back to coaching, I lie down and wait until it passes.
