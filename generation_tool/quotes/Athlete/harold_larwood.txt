English,Athlete
In my first season I took 76 wickets at an average of less than 5 runs.
Down the mine I dreamed of cricket; I bowled imaginery balls in the dark; I sent the stumps spinning and heard them rattling in the tunnels. No mishap was going to stop me from bowling in the real game, especially this one.
Cricket was my reason for living.
I must have made a good impression because a club official to us into his office and asked me if I would sign on for a year with a view to becoming a professional.
