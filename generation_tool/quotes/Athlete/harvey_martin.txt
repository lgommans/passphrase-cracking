American,Athlete
I had such a wonderful life before drugs and alcohol abuse. I've got that life back now and plan to keep it. Maybe I had to go through what I did to get to this point, to appreciate this life more.
I'm not mean, just aggressive.
I killed many a quarterback. I felt like I scored when I took their head off.
You stand still, somebody might get close to you. I don't stand still much anymore.
I love this acting stuff.
Acting like the person I'm supposed to be has always been the easiest thing for me.
I need to go where I feel loved.
