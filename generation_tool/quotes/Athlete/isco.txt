I'd say I'm a bit antimadridista although I do not know where my future will be, but it's a team that I never liked. I get the impression that it is an arrogant club, about how the players are. Without humility, you cannot get anywhere.
Madrid excites me. They are one of the best teams in the world.
When I was a boy, the neighbours all knew who I was because I'd take a ball with me everywhere I went.
It's great to have atmosphere at the stadium, but football is all about the players.
