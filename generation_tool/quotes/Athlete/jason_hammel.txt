Each outing is its own game. You roll on your game plan. It is a different chess match each time you go out there. I just try to be prepared.
A lot of people think pitchers, and they just think throwing and that's where all the power comes from. It's really not. It starts from the ground up. If you have a strong base, the legs will actually do the work and build all the torque and power you need to throw. So if you have weak legs at the end of the year, that's not good.
I'm a pro. I understand you check your ego at the door. If you don't have it that night, you don't have it that night. But sometimes you're like, 'Give me that opportunity to grind through this'.
It's hard to learn a new guy each time out there.
Potatoes are obviously a good source of potassium. Carbs, you're burning off energy there. And salt, obviously. It's not the breakfast or type of meal of champions, but there are quirky things for everybody.
I know my fastball command will get even better.
You have to go out and find a way to compete every day. I know what I can do and what I can offer the team.
I have always been a hard worker. I had to make some adjustments to find a way to make my delivery crisper and more repeatable.
You are not always going to have your A game; you might have your D game. You have to find a way to throw strikes no matter what.
It's very important to go pitch-by-pitch and game-by-game and not getting too far ahead of myself. In the past, it was trying to make up for a bad game and thinking ahead and what do I have to do to fix this.
