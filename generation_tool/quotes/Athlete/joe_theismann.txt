Rugby is great. The players don't wear helmets or padding; they just beat the living daylights out of each other and then go for a beer. I love that.
Nobody in football should be called a genius. A genius is a guy like Norman Einstein.
No matter how great you are, the next great one is already sitting there waiting to take your place.
I worked hard. I worked late. I went in early. I did everything I could to gain an advantage.
This is a game, first and foremost. There was only one Vince Lombardi, and he died.
When I can 10 or 11, my mom was the one out there catching passes for me. She was my prime receiver.
I was always told that I was too small, too skinny, too slow, not tough enough, and I never ever believed what people told me.
