The first thing about Houston is it's an organization run from a different perspective. In Cincy, the team lives off money it earns from football. Houston's owner has other business interests, and he controls the money.
Numerous things that go on such as the way Houston interacts with my family; we're treated in a first-class way. They helped us when my wife lost our baby daughter in a miscarriage. They help with anything you ask of them because they are a very caring organization with positive attitudes about its players.
In Cincy, we're told how much Gatorade we could take home. In Houston, we get what we request. You get soap and deodorant at your request. You don't have a roommate on road trips.
Obviously, the closer you get to that moment, the more you start to realize 'this is the last year of my contract.'
Any time you sign a big contract, you get in those later years, the expectations are high to play at a high level.
A lot of times, I go and face the top receiver, and that's a task... it comes with the territory, and I never back down from that challenge.
I want my team to win and to be the best player I can possibly be.
Obviously I read the newspaper sometimes, or I look on the Internet. When you go out in public, you hear things, and people ask you questions, and that's part of the game.
If you're on the top guy, you're going to get some balls thrown your way.
