It got to be so easy that I was actually disappointed.
I have never taken any substance to enhance my performance.
It sounded good. It was a story that Victor Conte told me to use. I was contacted by Dr. Goldman, and that's how the story came about. And that was my first time ever meeting, or speaking, to Dr. Goldman.
I'm not sure exactly what Victor told Dr. Goldman, but I don't think he fully knew what was going on... I think he was really oblivious. I don't think he knew.
