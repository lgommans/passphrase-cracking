Every athlete at his peak is going to perform with a different mental cocktail. I thrive in the underdog, reserved, it's-not-over-till-it's-over mindset.
I climbed brick facades as a kid. You'd kind of stick your fingers in there.
It would be really easy to write off the Dawn Wall as impossible. In terms of climbing technique, I'm learning a new language on this granite.
Climbing has a lot of themes that are applicable to people, no matter who you are.
I don't want to be guy that almost climbed Dawn Wall.
When you're climbing with someone who always sees the bright spot, even if there is no bright spot, that attitude is really helpful.
I'm practical, very data-driven, and process-oriented. If I look at a radar and see a giant green blob coming toward me, I'm thinking it's probably going to snow.
I like to control the risk I take. And when risk is taken out of my hands, it frustrates me.
