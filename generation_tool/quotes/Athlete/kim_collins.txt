Athlete
Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection.
This is my future and I will take personal responsibility for making sure all competition requirements are met.
If the IAAF feel that is the right way to go for TV rights and everything, the rule will stay. As much as I want to be on the podium, tonight is a sad night for athletics.
Whenever the competition is sleeping is when I shine.
I would like to thank the Commonwealth Games Federation for the very fair manner in which this matter has been dealt with.
