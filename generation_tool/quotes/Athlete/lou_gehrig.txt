When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter - that's something.
I might have had a tough break; but I have an awful lot to live for.
I love to win; but I love to lose almost as much. I love the thrill of victory, and I also love the challenge of defeat.
I'm not a headline guy. I know that as long as I was following Ruth to the plate I could have stood on my head and no one would have known the difference.
In the beginning I used to make one terrible play a game. Then I got so I'd make one a week and finally I'd pull a bad one about once a month. Now, I'm trying to keep it down to one a season.
There is no room in baseball for discrimination. It is our national pastime and a game for all.

The ballplayer who loses his head, who can't keep his cool, is worse than no ballplayer at all.
When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed - that's the finest I know.
What are you going to do? Admit to yourself that the pitchers have you on the point of surrender? You can't do that. You must make yourself think that the pitchers are just as good as they always have been or just as bad.
