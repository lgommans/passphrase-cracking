American,Athlete
I'm a jock and I'm an athlete, and that's what I love to do.
I was only 24 then, but 18 of those 24 years had been dedicated to wanting to get to that moment.
As a child I was very involved with sports and I knew at age 9 that I wanted to be an Olympic champion.
My father wasn't really involved and my mom is the light in my life.
We realized that the only persons we can truly trust in this world is each other and our families.
You forget that sometimes people are out there to get you - they don't even have a reason.
Everywhere we go, people recognize me.
It's hard to have a bad hair day when you're famous.
In my opinion, Jackie is the greatest female athlete ever.
I've set no world record.
I did pretty well at the Sydney Olympics, but those were my first Games.
Our lives are so hectic and full, and we have a big family right now.
When I'm home, I'm relaxed.
I'm an Internet junkie.
The ultimate would be to compete in a couple more Olympics, hopefully break some world records and wind up my sports career with a couple of years in the WNBA.
I'm for a drug-free sport and always will be.
Nobody has ever said anything about Marion Jones every using performance-enhancing drugs and they never will.
But I don't believe in guilt by association.
I think the people who have really followed my career from the time I was seven years old can see my steady progress and see the type of person and athlete I am.
I will continue to express the fact I am for a drug-free sport and always will be.
A lot of women say they love being pregnant, but I wasn't such a big fan.
