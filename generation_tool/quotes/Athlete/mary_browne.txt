If you want an accounting of your worth, count your friends.
The elegance of honesty needs no adornment.
Preconceived notions are the locks on the door to wisdom.
Expect people to be better than they are; it helps them to become better. But don't be disappointed when they are not; it helps them to keep trying.
You know you're old when you've lost all your marvels.
