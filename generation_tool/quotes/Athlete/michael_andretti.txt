Running on different types of racetracks is challenging - not only for the drivers, but even more for the team members who have to make adjustments to the cars before each race.
One thing I would like to see is a stronger ladder series for up-and-coming American drivers.
CART is one of the safest racing series in the world.
And when we go from braking to accelerating to cornering, the G-forces we pull are really demanding on our bodies. We definitely have to be in top shape.
Believe me, you lose more than a gallon of fluids during a race. You could lose between six and 10 pounds during a race, depending on hot it is.
If CART continues on, it's just going to drag all of open-wheel racing down.
When you're in the back of the pack, you can gamble a little bit more.
