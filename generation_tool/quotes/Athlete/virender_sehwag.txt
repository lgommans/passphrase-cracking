Indian,Athlete
One should always be happy, irrespective of what you achieve in a match or in life. That's how I live my life.
As for my batting, the best part about it is I have never changed it. I have never changed my thinking, I have never changed my batting style.
Because I knew I had got success at Ranji level, I was confident I would get some success in international cricket too.
If you know your game, you can handle pressure; you can handle any kind of situation, back yourself, and play your own game and get success.
The most important thing for any athlete is to know his ability. If you know your ability and have even a little bit of a strong mindset, you can get success, because your ability takes you to success.
To participate in a World Cup is a great honour and achievement. I've played in three World Cups. The whole world watches you during a World Cup and expects you to play innings to win games for your country.
When I was a kid, my first dream was to play Test matches, and the second one was to play 100 Test matches because there are very few people who have played 100 Tests for India.
When a person becomes satisfied, he doesn't run after things, doesn't worry about it, and doesn't make efforts.
I try to hit the ball along the ground, especially against fast bowlers. I also like the bat to come down in the right position and check if my body position is correct. If I'm really watching the ball carefully, then automatically I'm in a good position to hit it down the ground.
In my view, if you have good or bad technique, it doesn't matter. But you will survive if you can adjust your game at international level, you are mentally strong, you know your strengths and how to score runs.
It doesn't matter if you have one billion rupees in your bank account or one rupee. This is one life you get, and you'd rather spend it enjoying whatever you have, rather than thinking, 'Oh, I should have scored seven more runs, or I should get more money.'
