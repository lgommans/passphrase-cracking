I sleep with my socks on sometimes.
Were the Rolling Stones good looking? Well, Jagger was, but the rest of the dudes? Maybe not so much.
I was acting for years before the band, so I would like to get into that again.
I look up to a lot of old school drummers from the '70s, '80s, and '90s.
People ask, 'Why is it called 5 Seconds of Summer when there's four of you?'
It's a bonus if your girlfriend likes your music - definitely not a downfall.
It would be a bit awkward to be with a girlfriend who didn't love what you do.
I'm a big fan of rocky girls. I love Hayley Williams and the lead singer from Tonight Alive.
I can't really explain what it's like to be in love, but I feel like it's being comfortable. It's almost like having a best friend. It's a beautiful thing.
I was a Green Day guy because the first DVD I bought was Green Day's 'Bullet In A Bible,' the live album. That really empowered me to be not just a drummer but a performer. It's a really crucial part of why I wanted to be in a band.
Nirvana is next level. The songs are really cool to connect with on a more mature level, and I don't think I really understood that when I was 15.
Growing older, you respect the whole culture behind Nirvana.
Pete Wentz was the Justin Bieber of 2007. Girls loved him; they obsessed over him.
It's fun when you're confusing people.
I always wanted to be in a band with a bunch of dudes who loved Green Day and all that.
I love how Duran Duran had the female fan base, then it grew until males started to like them, too.
