My computer background is a black and white picture I took of the Niteroi Contemporary Art Museum in Brazil.
All I can say is thank God my stepdaughter's favourite band in the whole wide world is The Beatles. We do have dance parties to 'Wannabe' though.
My last name is actually my middle name. Gotcha!
I'm such a huge advocate for strong, intelligent representation of women in the media.
There's nothing wrong with being a little unusual.
To be honest, the piece of clothing from a man's wardrobe I wear most often, to bed and around the house, is my boyfriend's underwear. I think it's infinitely unfair that women are compelled to wear underwear with a comfort factor of zero whilst men stroll around in essentially the most comfortable item of clothing ever made.
I like men who style themselves so that I can tell they give a damn about how they present themselves, but not too much as to say that's probably what they care about most.
Spare me the carefully thought out accessorising that is supposed to look casually thrown on, while in actuality, hours have been spent on the picking and choosing of said jewellery, scarves, etc. Unless you are Keith Richards and can absolutely pull it off, less is more.
I used to have a hat obsession, but unfortunately for me, I have a tiny head, which means most hats don't fit very well. I do love them, though.
I absolutely love working in Australia. Overseas is a lot tougher - it's really hard to break into campaigns over there.
