Australian,Politician
We've lost sight of our role in the region and our view of our colleagues in the region.
Tony Blair will probably get thrown out by his party.
To send our troops, our ships, our planes to this war is ridiculous.
To make us a terrorist target in a region that is full of terrorism is dumb and unforgiveable.
The reality is, it will be a significant conflict going for many, many months, if not longer. Saddam Hussein is not a fool. He hasn't been sitting there waiting to get shot for 13 years.
The only person you resent is yourself.
Silence is best.
It's not just the war itself. It's what you do after the war and what structure you put in place and how you make that structure work.
I've been arguing this for months. This is not our war. This is not a war we should be in. Australia's better spending its time negotiating with North Korea.
I'm not tied to any particular political line.
I was not a politician.
I was just absolutely exhausted. The media said I've been treated for a nervous breakdown. All that stuff I just took as people taking the opportunity when you're down to give you a kick.
I think the Prime Minister has embarked on a journey and he has no idea where he's taking us.
I never wanted to separate from either wife. It was accumulated stress. We had virtually no time to ourselves. After politics we were both working very hard to establish new careers.
I had this habit of an academic of answering the question. I should have fobbed it off.
I got a bit enamoured with bigger houses and things like that.
Hussein has a strategy. I'm sure he'll implement that strategy, and it would be to our detriment. We're embarking on an exercise about which we know nothing.
