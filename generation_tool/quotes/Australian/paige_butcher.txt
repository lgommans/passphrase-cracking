Australian,Model
I've always only wanted to model. It really is the only life I want.
My mother was a fashion designer, and my father was a model.
Living in New York after 14 years, I'm such an outdoors kind of person. I love gardening and building things. I like restoring old furniture.
Actually, I'm not a gym rat. I'm not a gym person - I've never been. I've always been blessed to be thin. If I'm waiting for the kettle to boil, I'm doing 15 lunges.
I've always wanted to do charity stuff. I'm such a nurturer and love taking care of people.
