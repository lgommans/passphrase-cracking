Australian,Politician
Frankly, I've got to admit that I'm not perfect and have made some mistakes as some of the colourful stories about me reveal.
The importance of the House is... far more important than my future.
While it has been hurtful to my family and me to read constantly in the media that I was under investigation, I am pleased that as expected my spending has been found to be in order.
I believe I am entitled like any other person to have the presumption of innocence.
Pope Benedict is an amazingly visionary person. What he has done is establish an evolutionary process that will help undo the Reformation. The Anglican Church has been hijacked by modernism, with synods trying to amend the faith and this process will allow traditional Anglicans to be themselves.
My door remains always open to all constituents to discuss matters of concern to them.
I reiterate that I am strongly committed to working with those on all sides of politics to improve how Parliament operates.
