Australian,Model
I'm actually more confident when I'm tan.
Everyone has something unique about them.
I do believe that models should be older now. You tell girls to go and catwalk and be sexy, but some of these girls have never even experienced their first kiss, so they don't understand how to be like that.
I like doing Zumba. I only do it like, once a week. If I did it more often, I would be very skinny.
If I wasn't doing modeling, I'd like to study child psychology.
