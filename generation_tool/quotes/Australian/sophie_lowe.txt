Australian,Actress
My dad actually taught me how to do the catwalk because he used to do modeling. He taught me how to do that little swivel at the end.
When I first went to L.A., I really hated it. I had this preconceived idea of what it would be like. You think of Hollywood as this beautiful place, but everything looks rundown and old.
I think I've actually had a pretty standard upbringing. My parents are really normal, so I've always had them around to keep me grounded.
Although it sounds cliche, the main thing I want to do is touch people with what I do. I want everything I do to be meaningful, and I want it to be about more than just myself, or the money.
Everything happens for a reason. Say if I don't get a role, it may be that it would have stopped me getting another role.
