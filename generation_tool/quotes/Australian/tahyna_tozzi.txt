Australian,Actress
I love drama - mum calls me a Drama Queen!
I always wanted to be an actress. It's been very high up on my list of passions, and I did a couple of short courses, and I've studied at school.
I was so nervous because I was doing my first film. I didn't want to embarrass myself. I'm an incredibly insecure person, and knowing that I had to go on set in next to nothing, it scared me, but at the same time, I knew it would be a challenge to open me up, not only as an actress but as a person.
