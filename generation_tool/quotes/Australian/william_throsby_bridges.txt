Much as we may wish to make a new beginning, some part of us resists doing so as though we were making the first step toward disaster.
Genuine beginnings begin within us, even when they are brought to our attention by external opportunities.
Disenchantment, whether it is a minor disappointment or a major shock, is the signal that things are moving into transition in our lives.
We come to beginnings only at the end.
Each person's life is a story that is telling itself in the living.
If the guilt of sin is so great that nothing can satisfy it but the blood of Jesus; and the filth of sin is so great that nothing can fetch out the stain thereof but the blood of Jesus, how great, how heinous, how sinful must the evil of sin be.
