What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space.
Quantum physics thus reveals a basic oneness of the universe.
The scientist only imposes two things, namely truth and sincerity, imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists.
A careful analysis of the process of observation in atomic physics has shown that the subatomic particles have no meaning as isolated entities, but can only be understood as interconnections between the preparation of an experiment and the subsequent measurement.
For a solitary animal egoism is a virtue that tends to preserve and improve the species: in any kind of community it becomes a destructive vice.
I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.
An animal that embarks on forming states without greatly restricting egoism will perish.
The mathematical framework of quantum theory has passed countless successful tests and is now universally accepted as a consistent and accurate description of all atomic phenomena.
The verbal interpretation, on the other hand, i.e. the metaphysics of quantum physics, is on far less solid ground. In fact, in more than forty years physicists have not been able to provide a clear metaphysical model.
The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.
