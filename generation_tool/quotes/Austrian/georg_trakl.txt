Austrian,Poet
Shuddering under the autumn stars, each year, the head sinks lower and lower.
The near stillness recalls what is forgotten, extinct angels.
I drank the silence of God from a spring in the woods.
The blue of my eyes is extinguished in this night, the red gold of my heart.
For whoever is lonely there is a tavern.
Black frost. The ground is hard, the air tastes bitter. Your stars cluster in evil signs.
The guilt of newborns is immense.
Earlier lives drift by on silver soles, and the shadows of the damned descend into these sighing waters.
Silently, God opens his golden eyes over the place of skulls.
When we are thirsty, we drink the white waters of the pool, the sweetness of our mournful childhood.
