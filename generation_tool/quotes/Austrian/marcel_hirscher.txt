It's incredible how many emotions you feel when crossing the finish line and seeing that you are No. 1.
Nothing is worth putting my health on the line. Not a camera, not a title, nothing.
If you want to be among the greatest skiers, you have to win in Kitzbuehel at least once.
I have reasons to believe that I could win the World Cup, but I take it one race at a time.
