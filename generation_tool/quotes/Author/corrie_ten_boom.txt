Memories are the key not to the past, but to the future.
When a train goes through a tunnel and it gets dark, you don't throw away the ticket and jump off. You sit still and trust the engineer.
Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today of its strength.
The measure of a life, after all, is not its duration, but its donation.
Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.
Forgiveness is an act of the will, and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart.
Let God's promises shine on your problems.
Discernment is God's call to intercession, never to faultfinding.
The first step on the way to victory is to recognize the enemy.
Worry is a cycle of inefficient thoughts whirling around a center of fear.
Any concern too small to be turned into a prayer is too small to be made into a burden.
