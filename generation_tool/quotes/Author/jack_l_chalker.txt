American,Author
I am a registered Democrat and two-time unsuccessful candidate for office.
I have long been active in and supportive of conservation and historical preservation causes.
I write novels and other things.
I do not read SF as much as I used to. It's too much like a busman's holiday.
No, I don't autograph blank slips, checks, or stickers, and certainly no books without me in them.
If you got what it takes, you'll make it. If you don't, Shakespeare couldn't help you.
First, people don't read novels off screens, and they don't have a tendency to shell out real money for books when they don't retain anything physically for their money.
I have taught history on the high school and college levels, and am or have been a lecturer at the Smithsonian, The National Institutes of Health, and numerous colleges and universities, mostly on science fiction and technology subjects.
I am also a Kentucky Colonel and an Honorary Mayor of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, among other things.
Decadence is wonderful.
