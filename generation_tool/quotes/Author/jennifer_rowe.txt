You can always find time to do the thing you really, really want to do.
I certainly don't feel any more super than any of the other people I knew in my working life... Quite the reverse. In fact, guilt is my middle name, and I think anybody who does do that thing with work and children and everything knows exactly what I'm talking about.
I have an ideas book at home with far more ideas than I will ever be able to write.
