The universe is a great mystery.
I think about my editor when I write. She's a good friend, too.
I want to understand more about the world while I'm still here.
No day is alike - I do many other things, and I'm very active in the environmental movement.
I wrote 'Sophie's World' in three months, but I was only writing and sleeping. I work for 14 hours a day when I'm working on a book.
I am really more interested in questions than in giving answers.
Where did the world come from? The question has an answer, even though I cannot get to it. It is a good question. It is like a crime that has not been solved. There is an answer, even if police do not know it.
To wonder about life is not something we learn; it is something we forget.
