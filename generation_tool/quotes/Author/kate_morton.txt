Some say I'm an overnight success. Well, that was a very long night that lasted about 10 years. But while I do, of course, now feel the pressure having had books that have been very successful, I just know I have to concentrate on writing for myself. I can't worry about genres or markets or what might be commercial or not. That never works.
I write what I'd like to read and just hope that, along the way, others might like to read them, too.
I simply love writing good stories, that's my passion.
People might think writing is a hard business, but it's nowhere near acting.
I love the structural part of the writing process.
There's a market for mysteries for adults. That feeling of opening a book and delving inside and not coming out until you've closed the book.
In retrospect, it seems like everything in my life led to me becoming a writer. I just didn't realise it at the time.
I'd pretty much given up hope of being published, so I just wrote the book I wanted to read.
