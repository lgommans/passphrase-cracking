The '50s in general are written off as a boring decade following the turmoil of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath - the postwar Labour government, the cold war, the arrival of the New Look in fashion, etc. But I remember it as a very exciting time - a pioneering, rule-breaking time, especially for the young.
I find writing for children much easier. I don't mean it's less demanding - you've got to have a talent for it and you've got to work very hard - but you don't have to pull your guts out and lay them on the line in quite the same way as when you're writing for adults.
Innocence is ignorance.
The BBC is very good at period drama - world-famous for getting the details right.
I remember the mid-'50s well. It was when my life changed, and I left acting to become one of the first female television news reporters in the U.K.
