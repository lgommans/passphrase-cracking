The truth of the matter is that I live on an isolated cattle ranch in the middle of Oklahoma and that's not going to change.
I'm working on a second cookbook and am working on my love story, 'Black Heels to Tractor Wheels.'
I'm a thirty-something ranch wife, mother of four, moderately agoraphobic middle child who grew up on a golf course in the city.
I had been teaching myself photography.
I attended college in Los Angeles and wore black pumps to work every day.
My days are spent wrangling children, chipping dried manure from boots, washing jeans, and frying calf nuts.
Now I live in the middle of nowhere on a working cattle ranch.
I hate to play the I-live-in-the-country card, but it really takes all of the 'pack the kids into the car and run from here to there' out of the equation.
I'm a writer and a photographer - I'm totally aware that doesn't always translate to TV.
It never occurred to me that I was going to have to talk to a camera. I don't know if I can do this.
I want people to see how hard my husband and kids work on the ranch.
I'm wondering if I made the right decision about hair and makeup.
Knowing what I'll write about and what I won't has never really been a problem. I won't write about things that bore me.
I've set aside a nice chunk of my advertising revenue each month for giveaways, like a KitchenAid mixer. I like buying them for the audience, because without the audience I wouldn't have the blog or the revenue in the first place.
As The Pioneer Woman has grown and the revenue has grown, the prizes keep getting better, and that certainly feels good.
Ninety-five percent of the time when I run a contest I've purchased the giveaway prizes with advertising money.
