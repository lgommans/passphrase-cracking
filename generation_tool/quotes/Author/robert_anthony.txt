We fear the thing we want the most.
Most people would rather be certain they're miserable, than risk being happy.
Courage is simply the willingness to be afraid and act anyway.
If you let other people do it for you, they will do it to you.
When it becomes more difficult to suffer than to change... you will change.
Moving fast is not the same as going somewhere.
The best way to escape from your problem is to solve it.

We neither get better or worse as we get older, but more like ourselves.
If you are not leaning, no one will ever let you down.
Live as though it were your last day on earth. Some day you will be right.
