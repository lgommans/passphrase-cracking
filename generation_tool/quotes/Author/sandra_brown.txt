American,Author
I love being the bad guy, simply because I was always so responsible, so predictable growing up.
I made straight A's and never got into any trouble, and I still impose those standards on myself. So writing is my chance to escape and become the sleaziest, scummiest role.
I think of my books now as suspense novels, usually with a love story incorporated. They're absolutely a lot harder to write than romances. They take more plotting and real character development.
I came to write after several mini careers. I did live theatre, managed a cosmetics store and was a local television personality.
