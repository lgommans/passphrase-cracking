I've got this thing for spicy stuff. Now, if you give me hot chocolate with chili pepper, a book and a bubble bath, I'm a happy girl.
I definitely believe there is more than what can be seen. I don't know if it's anything that you'd consider omens or signs, but yes... I believe in something more.
I still have a lot of the stories I wrote in high school. Hand wrote... a number of them are in purple ink, rendering them illegible, a fact we should probably be forever thankful for.
My secret is simple. I have a very short attention span, and writing lots of things fast appeases that very attention span.
Ah, typical writing day? Well, I tend to do e-mail and the business stuff of writing more in the morning while my brain wakes up and then write more in the afternoon, sometimes from about 11 until 5, or 12 until 5. If a story is driving me nuts, I'll work more in the evenings, but usually I try not to do that. That's family time.
I don't write as much erotic romance as I used to, but I think that's just because my writing style has changed.
I'm pretty sure my love affair with science-fiction started with ET.
I normally hate books that have anything to do with medicine, thanks to my own background in nursing - FYI, almost everybody gets it wrong.
I still tend to read more urban fantasy and romance than science-fiction, but every once in a while, a couple of books will come along and knock my socks off.
