I'm a lapsed Zen Buddhist. I've read hundreds of books on Zen, I meditated daily for about fifteen years, and once spent a month studying with Vietnamese Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh.
As a kid, I fell in love with the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' I don't know why. I liked the werewolf, Gamera, The Hulk, but I loved the Creature.
My personal belief is that attraction to SF/F is coded right into your genes. I was attracted to monsters and robots as far back as I can remember.
I wrote a novel about an economic/environmental collapse titled 'Soft Apocalypse,' and that's definitely the sort I'm best prepared for. To write the novel, I did a lot of reading on what we might expect, so at the first sign, I'm ready to convert all of my assets to gold and ammo and stock up on freeze-dried food.
