The truth is always less interesting than the fiction.
In Europe, there are many filmmakers working in the same territory: immigration, and the things that are most disruptive to European life today. That's not a judgment. I think it's good that cinema looks at such things.
In documentaries, you're confronted with reality; you can not manipulate or move it.
It's counterproductive. The problem with sentimentality is that it kills the emotion.
