Brazilian,Musician
I'm an amateur.
I'm not a professional. Yet somehow, I manage to get away with it.
Every time I drive into Rio from the airport, I see the city for the first time and think how strange it is.
Music kind of kidnapped me for a while.
Had I not become entangled with music, I would have become an author much earlier.
Some people thought I was using my popularity as a singer to sell my first novel. For others, it was almost a sacrilege: a practitioner of a minor art daring to enter the field of high art.
Most people know my music but will never read my books.
Whatever is original in my writing comes from my musical apprenticeship. I look for rhythm in words. I imagine words as if they were musical chords. Often I'll write something, read it, and find it musically unsatisfactory. There is a musical imperative in my choice of words.
