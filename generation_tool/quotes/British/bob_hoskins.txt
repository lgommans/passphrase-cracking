British,Actor
I've played so many historical characters because most horrible dictators are short, fat, middle-aged men.
I realised one day that men are emotional cripples. We can't express ourselves emotionally, we can only do it with anger and humour. Emotional stability and expression comes from women.
I'm very romantic. I've emptied flower shops.
One of the things I've realised is that I am very simple. My wife asked me once if I loved her. I said: 'Look love, I'm a simple man. I love you. End of story.' But I guess you gotta keep saying it with women. I guess she needed reassurance.
It's your life, live it your way.
It's not easy to walk out on a marriage and two young kids, and it's the most difficult thing I've ever had to do.
I've watched films and even forgotten I'm in them.
I'd say I am partial to women.
If you are going to do a film properly you have to give yourself completely to it.
Actors are just entertainers, even the serious ones. That's all an actor is. He's like a serious Bruce Forsyth.
Monogamy is a possibility - and a necessity. Kids have got to have something they can rely on. You have got to have something you rely on.
Quantum physics is a bit of a passion of mine. It's extraordinary. There's a branch of mathematics that is based on lunacy, and that's wonderful.
I'm a feminist, yes! Very strongly.
I am fairly rich. Money's very handy, let's face it.
