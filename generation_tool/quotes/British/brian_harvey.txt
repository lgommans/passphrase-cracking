British,Musician
The last reunion was a bit of a rushed job, we had to do a gig and documentary.
We were the rebels of the music industry so we wanted to write a rebellious song.
I don't think I even knew how big we were at the time. It was mad. I gained a lot through East 17 and I'm grateful for being able to have that experience.
I love artists like Jon B, but I don't wanna be compared to anybody. I'm just doing my interpretation of rnb and how someone like me should be doing it.
Back then, as a kid, you made a choice of who you liked, and it was either us or 'Take That.' And if you liked 'East 17', it showed you knew what was going on, you were clued up, had better taste in music.
It's weird, man. I've had a weird life, and I don't want to end up on the dole. I'm fed up with the plumbing. And I think it would be good to be a little pop star again.
I asked the question, 'Will I ever perform again?'
Life is very precious.
We could give 'Take That' a run for their money.
