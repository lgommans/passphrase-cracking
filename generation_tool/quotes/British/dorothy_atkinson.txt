I just love playing characters that are a long way away from me.
If I have half an hour to spare, I just have to hit the shops. And I can get overexcited.
I'd heard Joyce Grenfell on the radio, and when Mum gave me a book of her comic routines, I just loved it. Me and my sister shared a bedroom, and every night I'd drive her mad with my version of 'George, Don't Do That' about people we knew at school.
Dad was a passionate sailor, and he taught me.
