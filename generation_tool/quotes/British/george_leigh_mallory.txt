What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money.
The highest of the world's mountains, it seems, has to make but a single gesture of magnificence to be the lord of all, vast in unchallenged and isolated supremacy.
The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this; What is the use of climbing Mount Everest? and my answer must at once be, it is no use. There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
We will stomp to the top with the wind in our teeth.
