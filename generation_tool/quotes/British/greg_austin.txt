What suprised me most about the real Gordon Selfridge was actually about his sons, Ralph and Oliver. They were both highly respected in their fields, influencing Information Technology and Robotics deeply. Oliver Selfridge has even been referred to as 'The Father of Machine Perception,' being a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence.
When I'm not acting, you'll probably either find me playing a game or working on my YouTube channel.
I just really hope I can do justice to the whole 'Doctor Who' universe.
