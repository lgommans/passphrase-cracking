True intelligence requires fabulous imagination.
Politics is the enemy of the imagination.
Atheists have as much conscience, possibly more, than people with deep religious conviction, and they still have the same problem of how they reconcile themselves to a bad deed in the past. It's a little easier if you've got a god to forgive you.

Not being boring is quite a challenge.
What reader wants to be told what attitude to strike?

Some people are tied to five hundred words a day, six days a week. I'm a hesitater.
