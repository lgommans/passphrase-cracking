British,Poet
Blue thou art, intensely blue; Flower, whence came thy dazzling hue?
Joys too exquisite to last, And yet more exquisite when past.
The Dove, on silver pinions, winged her peaceful way.
Hope against hope, and ask till ye receive.
Fairest and best adorned is she Whose clothing is humility.
Eternity: a moment standing still for ever.
'Tis human actions paint the chart of time.
Here hyacinths of heavenly blue, shook their rich tresses to the morn.
