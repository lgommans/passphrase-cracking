British,Musician
Ice cream is my comfort food.
I dress in a sophisticated and classy way - I always dress in a way I know my mother wouldn't be embarrassed to see.
Good music shouldn't have a shelf life.
I love Barbra Streisand and Sade who've both had careers in soul and I want my music to have that timeless quality that isn't necessarily now.
A female vocal can lift a song.
Dance music has pushed its way into the mainstream. Which is good for me.
I am just trying to keep it real.
I don't know if fame will come.
I would like to think I am feminist in some sorts.
My grandfather was a Russian-Jewish immigrant who lived in Northern Ireland and apparently when he sang in the synagogue he made everyone cry.
There are so many great singers out there.
I don't think too far ahead because I want to appreciate what's happening now.
If you're from South London you feel like you're always trying to win people over, so perhaps that underdog passion comes through.
I'm not a complicated person.
I don't know if I should say this, but I feel more like a singer than an artist.
I guess I'm a real fan of older music, and that's what shaped my taste and the way I sing.
I love dancing!
If I make a song where I'm happy, I sound completely mad - I think my voice is better-suited for sadder songs.
I want to be as feminine and classic as possible.
I like how strong Sade is and how she doesn't give away too much.
I can't eat before I go onstage because I've learnt that burping on stage isn't a good thing. It's all about acid reflux.
I've become one of those annoying people who brings their own food on to planes.
I did my dissertation on Kafka.
