British,Actress
I always wanted to be a doctor and go to art school, but I thought I'd regret it if I didn't act.
Some people say to be an actor you've got to die to do it. I think it's healthy if you think, 'I'll do it if it works, and if I don't, I can do something else.' That way seems to work for me.
I find celebrity really scary.
I am really easy to scare, and I don't enjoy watching spooky films.
Working in Birmingham for the first time was the best thing, especially as it was round the corner from my mum's house in Harborne!
