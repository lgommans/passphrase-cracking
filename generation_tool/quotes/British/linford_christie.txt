British,Athlete
Adopting a new healthier lifestyle can involve changing diet to include more fresh fruit and vegetables as well as increasing levels of exercise.
We have got to go out there and deliver, go on the streets and find athletes, improve facilities around the country and find coaches. We have got to go out there and search for a star.
There was no money in the sport but we'd be out there day in, day out, rain or shine, doing it.
Some of today's athletes do not have that kind of pride. They left school at 16, have never had a job in their life and are getting Lottery funding, earning money as an athlete.
My first love is the sport, and it will always be my priority.
If you criticise something then you have to have an alternative, but we do have to try and improve things.
I think it's great that they are getting funding, but it's just too easy. They don't have to work for it. We did it because we had pride, because we loved it.
I coach a few guys and they work very, very hard, but in our day we did it because we just loved it.
I am a coach on the outside of the establishment and that works.
But I sometimes think we have too much of a fixation about 2012.
I don't think there are really enough meetings in Britain for our athletes to compete properly, and because of this a lot of the talent we have has been stunted.
I have got better things to do in working with my athletes who I feel are going to be involved in 2012.
I know what it takes to get to the top.
I think the athletes respond well to me because I have been successful.
Obviously I was disappointed when it fell into disuse, because it was my own track named after me, but I am sure all those youngsters we lost will be coming back, and I certainly intend to be down here as much as I can, coaching and advising.
