British,Actor
Older women know who they are, and that makes them more beautiful than younger ones. I like to see a face with some character. I want to see lines. I want to see wrinkles.
If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?
A slice of hot, buttered toast is the perfect meal. It's not too much and not too little, and it gives you just the right buzz.
Just because I never went to university doesn't mean you can't read, although I do feel a bit uneducated from time to time.
I think that reality TV is so bad. It is a tool by the media to not make people think.
I was always in trouble from an early age. I had a fraught relationship with my parents, who were very traditional. Doing plays at school was a joyous release.
Let's just say I was really bad. Now I have grown into myself. I have changed.
Only when I came to America did I think of myself as British.
The older I get, the more I'm prepared to do things for the money.
It is not easy to get parts in mainstream films for most people of color. Hollywood and British writers are not writing parts for us, or the directors are not interested in casting us in parts that are color-blind.
I'm not an academic, but I've always loved poetry since I've been small.
I think any actor should be aware of where they're starting to stretch into what's not truthful.
The unknown is always frightening.
I couldn't bloody believe a prime-time TV show would have an Iraqi ex-Republican Guard torturer as a main character.
My mum made a conscious decision not to teach me any Indian languages so I wouldn't talk with an accent.
Los Angeles is the only place that I can honestly say I have ever called home.
I never felt at home in London, because people were constantly telling me I didn't belong here, so after a while, you tend to believe that.
I think I may have failed at a lot of things, but the one thing I can say, and that I'm proud of, is that I am a good parent.
