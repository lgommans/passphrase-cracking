British,Composer
I was a catastrophe at Science and Games, but the good thing about Quaker schools is that they encourage you in those subjects for which you show an aptitude.
The different parts of my career seemed to take part in different rooms, albeit in the same house. It was just the way things were and I didn't actually think much about it at the time.
Being on a musical quest was something I always enjoyed.
When I came across something I liked, I wanted to find out as much as I could about it. This was as true of hearing Hoagy Carmichael for the first time as it was later when I first heard Boulez.
I wanted to write music, and cook, and play cards, and have a nice time.
I hated teaching composition. I was playing music I didn't particularly want to play, being on committees I didn't want to be on.
I just scribbled away and eventually a C-major chord was there. I didn't ever decide I was going to be a composer. It was like being tall. It's what I was. It's what I did.
People ask what was the first piece of music I wrote. There was no first piece.
