British,Actor
As a musician myself, it annoys the hell out of me to watch an actor trying to play a guitar out of time with the music.
If you break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend, you're in this vulnerable state where you're still kind of half in the relationship with them, but you're single, and it takes a while to feel solid in yourself again.
I am a self-taught guitarist. I just try to piece together passages that have some melodic value!
My family runs a little art gallery back in Cornwall, so flashy cars and things like that have never really been particularly interesting to me.
Cornwall has lots of folk and Celtic music and has that kind of surfer vibe as well. That was my kind of upbringing.
