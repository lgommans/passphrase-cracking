The special relationship between twins is that, if there's anyone else in the world that's going to get or be the confidant that you need, it's an identical twin.
I think theater is a core need of a community.
I think beautiful independent films are made, and I think they're as close to what theater can be because they're not loaded with all of the extra stuff. It's human, and it's more organic, but theater is very unique... It's a different connection altogether.
I've always wanted to do a lot of things.
I just want to do good material. If I'm right for it, and it connects with me, and the material is good, I'm not going to say 'I'm just going to do this' or 'I have to do one of everything.' I'm not thinking like that.
I like going after good material, well-written material.
I always look for interesting, complex characters. You know, interesting, well-written material.
