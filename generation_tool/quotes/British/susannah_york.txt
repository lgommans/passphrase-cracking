Seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend.
I feel I'd like to share my luck and my life. Being in love is the best thing in the world.
A relationship is lovely if you're happy, comfortable in it and you really like the person. I can think of nothing better. But there's nothing worse than having a relationship in which you feel no interest.
Men find it difficult because I've got so much energy and hardly sleep at night, only four or five hours. I wake up in the early hours and potter around.
I've struggled so hard to reign in my temper because it actually terrifies me.
The things that make me very angry are injustice and bullying. If I see someone bullying a woman or child in the street, or kicking a dog, I go completely mad.
Acting and writing go together. Actors write because they love words and becoming other people - we love to escape into other characters.
Someone had told me about a house in Wandsworth, southwest London - 21 Blenkarne Road - with an incredible garden, so I went and had a look. I walked in and just said, 'I want it.'
I was brought up in Scotland and have always been a country person, although the town means a great deal to me, too.
