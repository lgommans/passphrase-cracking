American,Businessman
I'm very good in math, and I'm a logical thinker. I don't get wrapped up in things or even wrapped up in myself.
My wife made me get a cellphone, which I keep in my briefcase. I've never used it.
My father was the youngest of six brothers, and he was the brains. I never thought he was making what he should have. He had to split it with five brothers. So I made up my mind: I was going to go on my own and make my own money.
