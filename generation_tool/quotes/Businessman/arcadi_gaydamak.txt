Russian,Businessman
I speak Hebrew excellently.
'Gaydamak' in Turkish means a fighter. That's me.
In 1992, I was an official of the Angolan regime. I was appointed by that country to oversee the organization of the raw diamond market and responsible for the governmental authority that later controlled this market.
I'm no more or less Jewish than any other Jew. Israel has survived because we haven't forgot our Judaism, but there are some Israelis who did forget.
I am the most popular man in Israel.
