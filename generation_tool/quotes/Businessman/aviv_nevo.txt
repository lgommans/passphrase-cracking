Israeli,Businessman
I have everything and I have nothing. Sometimes I feel like the loneliest man on the planet. All this 'stuff' and no one to share it with. And then when women come along, I wonder if they like the stuff more than me.
All I want is good, honest, loyal friends.
I would like to get married, actually. I've done everything else in my life now except that, but where do I find the real thing? The non-phony? In Los Angeles? I am not so sure.
