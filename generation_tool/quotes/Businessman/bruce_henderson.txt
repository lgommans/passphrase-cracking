Your most dangerous competitors are those that are most like you.
The essential element of successful strategy is that it derives its success from the differences between competitors with a consequent difference in their behavior.
Any corporate policy and plan which is typical of the industry is doomed to mediocrity. Where this is not so, it should be possible to demonstrate that all other competitors are at a distinct disadvantage.
The objective is to enlarge the scope of your advantage which can only happen at someone else's expense.
