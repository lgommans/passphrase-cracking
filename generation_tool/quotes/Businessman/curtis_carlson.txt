American,Businessman
All my life I knew that there was all the money you could want out there. All you have to do is go after it.
Only as long as a company can produce a desired, worthwhile, and needed product or service, and can command the public, will it receive the public dollar and succeed.
I consider a goal as a journey rather than a destination. And each year I set a new goal.
