Brazilian,Businessman
I don't like showing my privacy online.
People always try to put a title or a symbol on you. If you work in a bank, you are a banker. For me, they see a co-founder of Facebook.
I am obligated and I will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the American government. I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen.
I am investing like a crazy person, mostly in internet start-ups. And I want to invest in Brazil as well, because I am Brazilian and that's in my heart.
Facebook wasn't built out of a Harvard dorm window.
I do have a Bentley. I do go out.
For charity purposes, how do I help? A lot of prospective levers and tools have come into my life.
