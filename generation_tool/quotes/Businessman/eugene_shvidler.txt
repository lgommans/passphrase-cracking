Russian,Businessman
Oligarch is just a nonsense word. What does it mean? I don't like it.
I grew up with communism, and if you live through communism you don't love it.
In Russian, ambition is a bad word. It's arrogant.
Do I appreciate my wealth? Absolutely, yes. I'm trying to embed in my children's heads that if you don't earn it, you don't appreciate it.
