Swedish,Businessman
Everything we earn we need as a reserve.
Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.
I'm stingy and I'm proud of the reputation.
If there is such a thing as good leadership, it is to give a good example. I have to do so for all the Ikea employees.
Our idea is to serve everybody, including people with little money.
I'm not afraid of turning 80 and I have lots of things to do. I don't have time for dying.
We ought to have more women in various management positions, because women are the ones who decide almost everything in the home.
I am very proud to follow the rules of our company.
People say I am cheap, and I don't mind if they do.
We have to still develop the Ikea group. We need many billions of Swiss francs to take on China or Russia.
