I'm not an extreme tree-hugger. I do believe trees grow and are a useful agricultural product that can be harvested without damaging the ecology and wildlife.
I think private ownership is generally superior to public because you care about the land more and it doesn't get trashed.
The public doesn't particularly care for advertisements.
