Nothing turns off an investor more than when an entrepreneur comes in with a ridiculous valuation.
I have seen entrepreneurs ask for hundreds of millions of dollars on a concept and try to sell because of 'their passion' for an idea. If the idea is that good, why wouldn't I cut you out and hire someone who is just as passionate for much, much less?
I understand that finance can be very complex.
People must be realistic when evaluating their business.
By definition startups usually do not turn a profit.
I've spent over 25 years in the television industry, the direct response industry. I met a lot of people and certainly learned the power of commercials and their brand building potential.
Reality TV is a totally different animal than the infomercial world.
