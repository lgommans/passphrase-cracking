American,Businessman
A woman at the Limited once asked me, 'Why do you work?' She said, 'You made a lot of money as a young man, so why are you still working?' I had never thought about it before. Forced to consider it, I told her, 'You know why? Because I think that if you stop to smell the roses, you'll get hit by a truck.'
I don't think most analysts understand that whether I work a 70-hour week or an 80-hour week, I take my head with me when I go home.
As an entrepreneur, you work out solutions.
Growing up, I knew you were supposed to have a profession - and something better than being a shopkeeper, which is what my parents were.
Sometimes I wish I lived more in the day, but I'm happier thinking about tomorrow or the day after. The way I see it, there's always a new or next thing.
In the '70s and '80s, the mentality of America was that everything was disposable. The notion of quality wasn't important.
Entrepreneurs, guys that start businesses, grow with them. It's more painful than it would appear.
