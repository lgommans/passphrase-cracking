Chinese,Businessman
The Chinese have always enjoyed gambling, and Macau is the only place in Greater China where gambling is legal. So I believe the government understands that there has to be a place for it.
If you don't take risks, you won't be able to do anything. I was confident I could use my experience to change and improve the way Macau worked.
If I make money, I'm happy. Even if I lose money, I'm happy.
