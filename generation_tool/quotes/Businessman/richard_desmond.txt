I hate to admit this, but I've never actually hit anyone. I don't even kill wasps or spiders. I'm pretty veggie as well. In fact, really, I'm New Age.
I love my BlackBerry, I love my Apple Mac, I love technology.
I suppose when you are an outsider, you will always be an outsider.
I've been offered a peerage already, and turned it down.
I'm in spend-down. I've got a billion in cash. You can't leave people a billion pounds, can you?
When I was 13, I forged my date of birth so that I could get a Saturday job at Woolworth's, earning £1 3s 6d for the day. But my real ambition was to do something in the music world - or, at least, close to it.
The hardest thing was launching 'OK!' magazine; the easiest thing was Channel 5. 'The Express' was my defining moment because our turnover was less than £100m with 150 employees.
Musicians get tense at big gigs. Some you can't talk to before the concert; some you can't talk to afterwards; some need the same size dressing rooms as others; others need bigger; some have comments to make on others' musicianship or how a particular song ought to be played.
I've got so much money it's ridiculous.
It's great isn't it, all this exercise lark? I used to laugh at people on treadmills; now I love it.
