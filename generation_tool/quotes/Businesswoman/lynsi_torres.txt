Never sell, never franchise.
I had no idea In-N-Out was going to fall on my lap as soon as it did.
I like to fly under the radar.
I am a deeply spiritual and religious person both privately and publicly.
In-N-Out Burger has a well-known and long standing reputation as a corporation that is operated with a Christian message and philosophy.
I was a daddy's girl.
I'm a lot like my dad: a little bit of a daredevil. I like an adrenaline rush.
My dad took me to the racetrack for the first time when I was 2 or 3... Anything with a motor, that was in my blood.
Drag racing has played a big role in In-N-Out's history, and it is also an important part of my family history.
