Marketing is designed to bring people into something.
You have to be a strong advocate of the shows you believe in. Sometimes those skills are very similar to agenting.
Most development doesn't make it to series. So you want the writer and director to have a really good experience with development because, if it doesn't work out, you want to work with them again. You have to know their work really well, know the drafts really well, and when you give notes, you need to have really thought them through.
Not every show needs to reach the same size of audience, or same width, of a 'Sopranos'.
I'm actually totally the prude of my family.
The best part of my job is that we can be making shows like 'Boardwalk', 'Thrones', 'True Blood' but also female-centered comedies like 'Enlightened', 'Veep' and 'Girls'.
The hunger for knowing is what excites me. I get to geek out about editing, be on set, give notes to writers - I love it all.
I throw on a dress and heels and I'm good to go.
