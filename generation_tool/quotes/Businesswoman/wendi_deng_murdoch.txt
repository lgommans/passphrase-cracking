Chinese,Businesswoman
My grandmother died in childbirth, and my great-aunt lived with us. She had bound feet. She never knew how to read or write.
I'm loyal, and I like my friends. Friendship enriches your life and makes it more interesting.
I grew up in a little funny town called Xuzhou, in the countryside, very poor. We didn't have hot water. We were four children: three girls and a boy.
My parents pushed us very hard to work, both in the home, doing chores and cooking, and at school.
I wasn't necessarily the brightest in my family. I think my older sister was probably more clever, but I worked very hard.
I really make sure that my girls understand the importance of education. I don't want them to be spoilt and only know private school kids. I want them to behave well by example.
I had never been in a supermarket before coming to America. At home, my parents wouldn't let me open the refrigerator, because they worried I'd damage the door by opening it too many times.
I believe if you are nice to people, children will follow. Likewise, if you are rude to people, children will follow.
As for what other people think of me, I could worry about that every day, but choose not to.
I didn't ever plan to be a producer, and I didn't really know what I was getting myself into.
My children speak very good Chinese, and they translate for our American friends.
I grew up in China, but I live in the U.S. and I want my children to understand what's going on over there. They ask me sometimes, 'Are we Chinese or Australians?' My family are in L.A., New York and China, and they have the freedom to go back and forth, which is really, really nice.
