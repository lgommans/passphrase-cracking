I've always found that sci-fi fans are unbelievably generous.
Comedy is really my passion. I started out way before television doing sketch comedy with other women. Very much along the lines of, at the time it was 'Sensible Footwear', but now it's 'Smack The Pony', 'French And Saunders', that kind of thing. That's how I started out.
Ever since I started doing television, I tended to get cast, for the most part, as these strong, intelligent women... Which is wonderful, but very rarely do I get to be the goofy girl that I am.
I love acting... I really do. I love crawling into another character's skin. That's something that I've always, always, always, always wanted.
I got roped into Twitter. I actually quite enjoy it! But I don't go on as often as some.
Every time I've done a fund raiser, I've been blown away by the amount of money and the generosity that our fans have.
