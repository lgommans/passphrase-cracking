Canadian,Musician
After touring with David Bowie last year, I was inspired to look at what I wanted to do as an artist, and I realized I wanted to go back to the music I fell in love with when I was eight years old.
I'm interested in astrology and astronomy.
Writing has become such an outlet for me that when I don't have it, I just get pent up.
I traveled nonstop in 2009, so when my son popped out and my passport expired for a while, I felt more than happy just to be at home here in Canada.
If I never saw another airport again, I'd be happy!
My heart has been resuscitated as a result of becoming a mom.
I want to be honest, and even if that's scary, I know it's worth it.
