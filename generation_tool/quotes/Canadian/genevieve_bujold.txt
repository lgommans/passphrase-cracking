Canadian,Actress
I confess it, I love the camera. When it's not on me, I'm not quite alive.
I don't like to intellectualize about my acting.
I don't sit around and study the pages of a script over and over again.
I don't worry whether the period is contemporary or three hundred years ago. Human beings are all alike.
The main thing in acting is honesty, to feel the humanity and get to the essence of the character. You can't put anything into a character that you haven't got within you.
I don't like to intellectualize about my acting. I don't sit around and study the pages of a script over and over again.
