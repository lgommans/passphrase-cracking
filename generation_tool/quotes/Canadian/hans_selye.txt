Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.
Its not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.
Man should not try to avoid stress any more than he would shun food, love or exercise.
Every stress leaves an indelible scar, and the organism pays for its survival after a stressful situation by becoming a little older.
If you want to live a long life, focus on making contributions.
As much as we thirst for approval we dread condemnation.
