Envy comes from people's ignorance of, or lack of belief in, their own gifts.
Growth begins when we begin to accept our own weakness.
Life is a succession of crises and moments when we have to rediscover who we are and what we really want.
Community begins in mystery and ends in administration. Leaders move away from people and into paper.
