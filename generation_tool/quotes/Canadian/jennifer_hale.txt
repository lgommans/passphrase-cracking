That's really one of the things I love about video games. It's a whole new world every time you start.
I assume the body language no matter what in doing voiceover. There is a transformative aspect.
Being able to stay with a character over the course of years is a gift.
There's more flexibility in the cartoon world than there is in video games. In video games, if I tweak a line, I could screw up the work of countless other people with my whim.
I don't spend a lot of time watching my performances after the fact. I suck at playing video games, but I'm a fan of the creativity, the brilliance, and the possibility of the industry.
In the 'Mass Effect' universe, there is zero ad libbing.
Everything about video games has changed. The writing, the acting, the visuals, obviously - everything has gone to a new level. And the difference that I see as an actor is that I don't have to push that extra bit to sell what's going on.
Endings are really hard to do, and it's hard to do an ending where it's sort of collaborative with thousands and thousands of people, and to satisfy all those people is impossible.
Military people do not get what they want by being emotional.
I had, probably, a more challenging experience growing up than most middle-class chicks.
I'm used to living in a disassociated universe.
I am an outside person; if I don't get outside, I get a little crazy.
I like it when I can hear directly from the writer: what they're seeing, what they're envisioning, and what their intention is.
On a Bioware game, if I say anything that's not on the page, It would create a bug in the system, and it would kick back, and I would have to do it again due the technical demands they deal with.
