Canadian,Novelist
I'm very happy being me, although sometimes I'd love to be a bird so that I could fly.
Perfect happiness is knowing that everyone I love is healthy, safe, and content.
I've always been hopelessly stuck in the present.
I always say what's on my mind. No need to second guess with me.
I might not write fiction in the literary sense. But I write very well. My characters are good. My dialogue is good. And my stories are really involving.
I'm writing exactly the kinds of books I like to write. And they're the kinds of books I like to read. They're popular commercial fiction. That's what they are.
My books are not generic. You know when you're reading a Joy Fielding book.
There aren't too many people out there who can start one of my books and not finish it. I don't think too many writers can say that.
