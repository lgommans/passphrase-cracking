Canadian,Actor
My mother - the Irish side of the family - was very musical. My mother was a singer; there was music around the house all the time.
I was a boy soprano. I had a natural kind of voice and then trained it after my voice changed.
I like to keep busy.
I pursued a theatre career, and Hollywood came calling.
It's a joy to work where I live, and come home and sleep in my own bed.
For my first acting job I played the role of Ensign Pulver in 'Mr. Roberts' at the Manitoba Theatre Centre.
My mother was a singer, and both of her sisters were singers. There was always music around.
I grew up in Winnipeg, in the Canadian midwest, the fifth child. It was a great household to grow up in - I was loved to sweet death.
I didn't have to do paper routes. I'd sing for 5 bucks a crack at weddings and church functions; I'd have four or five on some Saturdays.
I was an actor for over a year before I ever saw a play.
