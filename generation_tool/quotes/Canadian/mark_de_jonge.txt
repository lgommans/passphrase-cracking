Predictions are predictions. If you could predict the stock market, you would be super rich. But I have to race the race. It doesn't matter what I've done over the last few years. I have to race at the Olympics.
The start is crucial, really, but the entire race is crucial. There is not any room for error. If there is one bad stroke, you regularly lose the race.
A lot of things are out of my control, and that's all the other athletes. I can be the best I can ever be, and if there's someone better, they'll win the race. I'm aware of that.
Yes, I could win the Olympics. I hope to, and that's what I'm training for. But it's really going to come down to me racing on that day... Just being really calm and mature about what the reality is - that's my strategy.
I choose not to believe in superstitions. On race day, I have plans that I follow. I don't necessarily think about brushing my hair a certain way or doing certain things that make no sense as it relates to my performance.
