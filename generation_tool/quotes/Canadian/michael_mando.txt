Canadian,Actor
Commit to what you love - that's important. Believe in yourself and try as much as possible to do everything you do from a place of love. Not labor, but love.
I think as an actor... I don't like to compare a character to anybody else, just because I respect other people's work, and I want that character to have his own identity.
I'm a big fan of 'Orphan Black,' and to be one of the original cast members is something that will always be dear to me.
I'm personally attracted to great writing - that's what turns me on the most.
'Better Call Saul' happens in the same universe as 'Breaking Bad,' and we have the same writers and mostly the same crew. Like 'Breaking Bad,' it is a transformation story, and Bob Odenkirk brings his own distinctive flavour.
Before acting, I was always attracted to words, to literature - be they the words of Williams, Arthur Miller, Shakespeare or Moliere.
