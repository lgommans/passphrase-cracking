Canadian,Actor
I'm a huge gamer. I play a lot of games, and I play one game until I'm really, really good at it.
Acting offers me an outlet. Here is the perfect opportunity to spend fleeting moments becoming an entirely different person; to experience a character entirely unlike myself, but to also make such a character a part of me. There is no routine here; there is no boredom.
I wanted to be a stuntman. I didn't really want to be an actor. I took classes when I was younger, but I really sucked.
In high school I was president of the Student Council, and I ended up doing a lot of speeches. After you do a few in front of different schools, you get really comfortable talking in front of an audience.
How does one get bored of life?
I'm a homebody for sure. I do a lot of work at home.
I was born and raised in Vancouver. I moved to Beijing in 2010 just before the Olympics. Being an Asian Canadian actor, the amount of opportunity at the time was slim to none. I made the decision to go to China, and it was one of the best decisions of my life.
I do like alternative rock and rap, but as far as inspirational, then I go full-on orchestra. It fills up your entire being.
I try to do as much as I can, every facet of filmmaking.
When someone asks me to do something, something new, something I don't know about, and if I haven't done it, I'll say yes. Just so I can try something new. You never know what you might like.
