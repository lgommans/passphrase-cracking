I think every woman should have a one-night stand. If it's done right, it can be liberating.
When I interview celebrities, I always try to throw them off balance. My favorite is to ask 'em about crazy sex stuff like donkey punches and Monroe transfers. Works every time.
Women are more likely to have sex and fall in love, which can be tough because that's not the way men work.
If we know we're just going to have sex and then ditch the guy, it can be fun.
I asked each one of them to make out with me and their reactions varied from excitable to horrified.
Paris and Nicky Hilton? Those girls will show up to the opening of a phone book. It's like a big joke.
David Bowie was awesome the easiest, coolest interview I have ever done.
I interviewed Johnny Knoxville once. I was kind of scared to interview him because I thought he might be a real jerk, but he was really nice, and I ripped his chest hair out.
Brandon Boyd of Incubus is hot, but he's too pretty.
