My girlfriend doesn't think I'm funny at all.
I was playing a relatively high level of hockey, and I thought that's what I wanted to do. But I had my first movie audition, and I was hooked.
It's not really a guilty pleasure, but I love old cartoons. I could watch Bugs Bunny and Tweety all day long.
I've broken my wrist, dislocated toes and shoulders, gotten stitches, you name it. However, the worst was a severely bruised femur. I got body checked into an open gate while playing hockey. The doctor couldn't believe I didn't shatter my femur.
I don't like people touching my face.
My dad's a jeweller, and my mom works for a bank.
I grew up watching 'Power Rangers,' 'Ninja Turtles', 'Batman.' You name it, I was a huge fan. And that's what I used to play with my friends. We would have the masks and the swords and pretend we had super powers.
