Think until it hurts.
I've got money so I'm a Conservative.
I have a magpie mind. I like anything that glitters.
I buy newspapers to make money to buy more newspapers to make more money.
As for editorial content, that's the stuff you separate the ads with.
Like having your own licence to print money.
You carry your country with you, it's part of your baggage.
