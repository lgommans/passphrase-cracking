I have to say that Common is one of the kindest, most humble, grateful individuals that I've ever met in my life. I was profoundly affected by meeting him. I think he is an outstanding human being.
Everything in moderation, and there's a perfect balance in this life if we can find it.
I've always loved a good Western.
I don't get to do a lot of fight scenes on 'Sanctuary,' but I'm a trained fighter; I've been doing martial arts for years and, you know, I'm very active physically; I used to be a circus performer.
What's great about having a sci-fi/fantasy show start on the web: that's a gigantic part of your demographic right there. It targets a significant part of your demographic when you deliver online.
