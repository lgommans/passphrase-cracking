Canadian,Model
I started acting when I was 17. I started modeling when I was 13. It helps in the way that you don't get fazed by cameras too much.
It's difficult because usually when they cast things, the main characters are Caucasian in absolutely almost every situation.
There's something about Brooklyn that reminds me of Toronto. I think because it's so community-minded.
I just started taking Mandarin classes. I love the idea of globalization: of being able to work in different countries.
There have definitely been ebbs and flows in my career, but, you know, part of the reason is that I'm a mom. I have a five-year-old daughter. She really factors into my choices, and I never want to go too long without seeing her.
To be honest, I kind of dress like a 15-year-old boy. And I probably live like a 15-year-old boy, too.
