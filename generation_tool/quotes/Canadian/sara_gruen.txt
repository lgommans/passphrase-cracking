I just don't think I've had the desire yet to write a vicious animal - like a dog-gone-bad or anything - where I do feel that I need a balance of all types of humans.
I just think I'm better equipped to make a study of human personality than trying to get into the mind of animals.
I think there is just a vein of humanity that really loves animals and really loves to read about them.
I tend not to think about the reading public at all, or the business, when I'm writing.
You work hard on a book and throw it out there and then it's beyond your control.
It seems natural to surround my fictional world with animals because my reality is full of them. When I'm sitting there conceiving a story, they just pop up.
Gorillas are in danger of being wiped out by the Ebola virus. I feel like we have limited time to get to know them and understand them and they're going to disappear - that's terrifically sad. Wouldn't it be great if we could stop that?
I don't like outlining, because books are organic things. Sometimes a book doesn't want to be written in a certain way.
