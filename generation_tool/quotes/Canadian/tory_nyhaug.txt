We've all crashed; we see crashes every race and we know it's something we have to deal with. It's BMX - it can happen at anytime. Nothing's for sure in this sport, if I've learned anything.
I'd rather live my life and do what I love and experience it. If I have some issues when I'm older, I mean, that's the cost of living a fantastic life.
If you come off the start in a final in fourth or fifth, realistically, the best you can probably do is a podium - squeeze second, third. The chance of you winning at any major race if you get cut off down the hill is pretty remote.
Crashing is part of the sport. It sucks when it happens, but that's the way it is.
Definitely, injuries are tough, and they happen to every athlete in every sport. The best athletes put it behind them and keep pushing forward. I haven't really had a choice; I've had so many injuries. And the love of BMX, I haven't wanted to stop no matter what.
