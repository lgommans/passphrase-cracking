Canadian,Photographer
Look and think before opening the shutter. The heart and mind are the true lens of the camera.
Character, like a photograph, develops in darkness.
I've also seen that great men are often lonely. This is understandable, because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone. But that same loneliness is part of their ability to create.
There is a brief moment when all there is in a man's mind and soul and spirit is reflected through his eyes, his hands, his attitude. This is the moment to record.
Within every man and woman a secret is hidden, and as a photographer it is my task to reveal it if I can.
If there is a single quality that is shared by all great men, it is vanity.
The trouble with photographing beautiful women is that you never get into the dark room until after they've gone.
