It is not good enough for things to be planned - they still have to be done; for the intention to become a reality, energy has to be launched into operation.
We have met the enemy and he is us.
In like a dimwit, out like a light.
Women aren't as mere as they used to be.
We are confronted with insurmountable opportunities.
Every burden is a blessing.
