British,Celebrity
Every time we had a raid, I'd get a boyfriend out of it.
Vicars, MPS and lawyers were amont those who considered me to be the best hostess in London.
My biographer said that my parties reminded them of a vicarage tea party, with sex thrown in.
I allowed the scriptwriter to come to my parties for research and it's a good thing he did otherwise I don't think Personal Services would've been so good.
I think all old folk's homes should have striptease. If I ran one I'd have a striptease every week.
Once the film came out everyone wanted me, including George Michael.
I always seemed to fall in love with policemen.
I'm glad I haven't married - I crave excitement.
If men want sex they'll find it.
Like I said in my election manifesto - why don't they legalise the whole thing and let people like me work?
By 1980, when I came out of prison, The Sun did a campaign to stop putting vice girls in prison. We've talked about it ever since and nothing has been done about it.
It's been a rollercoaster life but it hasn't been boring.
When I look back at the 1980s I pinch myself. Did I really do all that?
Galvanised into action by the second trial, I was determined to change Britain's archaic sex laws.
