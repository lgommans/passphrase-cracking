Cuban,Celebrity
Because he'll take me to Cuba and I don't want to go to Cuba.
I'd like to go to Cuba.
It's the least that someone can do, someone like me that owes so much to this people and to the revolution: study hard, but more than that, defend them under any circumstance.
Wherever I go, there's always a child, an old woman, that comes to me and wants to meet me. Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family.
I don't profess to have any religion, but if I did, my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.
Fidel Castro for me is like a father.
