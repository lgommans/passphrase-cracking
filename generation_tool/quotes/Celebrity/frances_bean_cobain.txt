If you're a big Nirvana fan, a big Hole fan, then I understand why you would want to get to know me, but I'm not my parents.
I'm a different person. I don't want to be titled as Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain's daughter. I want to be thought of as Frances Cobain.
These people are fascinated by me, but I haven't done anything.
My look is a Modern Bohemian type thing.
I'm famous by default. I came out of the womb, and people wanted to know who I was because of my parents.
I'm in a monogamous relationship and very happy.
I don't like to look sloppy. I'm a girly-girl.
I have 137 pairs of shoes and 200 pairs of jeans.
While I'm generally silent on the affairs of my biological mother, her recent tirade has taken a gross turn.
Twitter should ban my mother.
We've moved so much, and my life has been so inconsistent.
I'm really lucky, because I've been able to go places and meet people you can only dream of.
It's creepy to see fan sites about me.
So I have been careful about where I go and who I hang out with because if you tell someone the wrong thing, then it's everywhere.
I can count on one hand how many people I trust.
