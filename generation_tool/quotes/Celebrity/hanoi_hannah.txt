Vietnamese,Celebrity
I am happy with what I've done.
This is the voice of Vietnam Broadcasting from Hanoi, capitol of the Democratic republic of Vietnam.
We asked Jane Fonda if she would like to meet American pilots in Hanoi, but she refused, she didn't want to.
There's a policy now of opening the doors to the outside world.
Nothing is more confused than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on.
American GIs don't fight this unjust immoral and illegal war of Johnson's.
Our program for American GIs can be heard at 1630 hours.
It wasn't a new idea. During the war against the French we had this kind of broadcast for the French soldiers.
Because the GIs were sent massively to South Vietnam, maybe it's a good idea to have a broadcast for them.
And we broadcast tapes sent to us from Americans against the war. These were most effective I believe.
Americans are xenophobic, they will believe their own people rather than the adversary, even a friendly enemy voice.
We advised them to do what they think proper against the war.
I put my heart in my work.
And we also read Newsweek, Time and several newspapers.
Well, we think the broadcasts did have some effect, because we see the antiwar movement in the U.S. building up, growing and so we think that our broadcast is a support to this antiwar movement.
Because our fight has been for such a long time we are isolated from the world, even after reconstruction we don't have much attention from people outside.
I would like to see America some day.
I have always compared our traditions of liberty, like those of Abraham Lincoln and Ho Chi Minh.
I had to do something for the country.
Sometimes my colleagues joke and call me Hannah.
