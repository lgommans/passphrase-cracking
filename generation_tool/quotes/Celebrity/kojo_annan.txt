I admire my father greatly.
I would never play any role in anything that involves the United Nations for obvious reasons.
I feel the whole issue has been a witchhunt from day one as part of a broader Republican political agenda.
What will the U.S. senators have to say if there is, as many over here and in the rest of the world suspect, no substance to the allegations against my father and me?
I have never participated directly or indirectly in any business related to the United Nations.
My father is a man of impeccable character who has worked tirelessly for the United Nations for many years. His integrity is beyond reproach.
