Riding a bicycle is about getting back to basics. It's good for the waistline and it's good for the wallet, is what I'm saying.
People ask me what the most important thing to take on the race is, and I always say it's a sense of humor. If you've got nothing but a sense of humor, you will survive.
I like to have fun with them. I like to toy with them a little bit. we're making television, after all. Right?
I really wish we could stay longer in the countries we visit, but I've been lucky to have visited most of them before, because I've done a tremendous amount of travel.
With any good story, you need the adversary, the heroes and villains. You need a good mixture to make it work.
Inevitably you're going to be delayed somewhere. Always have a book. Always have a movie. Always have a notebook. And then always have a sense of humour.
There's a sameness and comfort level you get living in a country like America.
La Paz, Bolivia, is the most extraordinary city.
