American,Chef
The kitchen is a sacred space.
I've had every haircut you could possibly imagine: mullet, tail, dreadlocks, afro, crew cut. It's always been an expression of who I am.
I'm in the kitchen five days a week, no matter what, and one or two of those days I'm on the line. Not because I have to be, but because I want to be.
This is going to sound weird, but when I was a kid my old man used to tell us that he was a Sioux Indian warrior in his former life. Native American culture was always big in my house - I don't know why.
I have nothing against turkey. We eat turkey for Thanksgiving in my house.
