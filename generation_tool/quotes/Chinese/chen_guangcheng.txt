Chinese,Activist
How a society treats its disabled is the true measure of a civilization.
I am not a hero.
I want to extend my gratitude and thankfulness to all those who care and love my family and myself, and our situation, especially the American people who show their care about the quality of justice as a universal value and I'm very grateful to all of you.
I'm just doing what my conscience asks me to do.
I cannot be silent when facing these evils against women and children.
I've come out of a small jail and entered a bigger one.
I can be jailed again at any time, it is very easy. They can say I am a criminal and just lock me up.
My safety and my family's safety are not guaranteed even now.
China is on a march toward rule of law and democracy.
The Chinese foreign ministry has said more than once that I am a free person. Did I do anything wrong by leaving my home?
I feel it's in people's nature to want to stop evil and embrace the good.
I am not in exile.
No matter what happens, I feel very good about the future.
