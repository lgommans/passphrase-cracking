It does not matter how much we donate; it matters whether the donation is meaningful. How to define meaningful? Let society and history judge.
You need strong leadership to effectuate change, and the easiest way is to keep everything status quo. And sometimes changes are necessary. If not, you build up too much potential energy.
If you donate to the mainland, it's not as simple as giving money. You need a lot of psychological resilience.
The world is far more interconnected today. Hence the need to understand each other is greater than ever before.
To be honest, we donate to projects that we think are meaningful. How society views it or how we are viewed by history, well, we'll let them decide. How others view us is out of our control.
All the family money is for philanthropy, except for living expenses for my mother. She is 94 and isn't a big spender.
If you donate overseas, it's a simple matter. In mainland China, there are so many headaches.
I've always been pessimistic about China. I can't see China going on without economic or social issues.
