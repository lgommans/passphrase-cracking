Chinese,Businesswoman
Some day, I'd like to be known as the queen of containerboards.
My desire has always been to be the leader in an industry.
Waste paper is like a forest - paper recycles itself, generation after generation.
In the '80s and '90s, China went through a giant change. It needed all resources. At the time, I was in the recycled paper business, and I realized the China market was a blank slate.
I went to the U.S. for business because I thought America is a big consuming country, although it's not an overconsuming country.
