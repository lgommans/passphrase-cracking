If you love something let it go free. If it doesn't come back, you never had it. If it comes back, love it forever.
First rule of Economics 101: our desires are insatiable. Second rule: we can stomach only three Big Macs at a time.
The key to heaven's gate cannot be duplicated.

Seeing the light is a choice, not seeing the light is no choice.
