If you don't have your health, you don't have anything.
If you're running on fumes, you get to a point of diminishing results. Get some rest.
With expectations, when you throw that stuff out there, when you put a bunch of pressure on yourself to reach those goals, you don't do anything different. You just keep working to get better.
You're defined by how you play the game, not by the game itself.
I've got so many things coming across my desk right now that are nonfootball related, I can't stand it.
I am the luckiest man in the world.
My vision is that I'm living to see two more daughters get married, dance at their weddings and then lift the Lombardi Trophy several times.
When I was a kid growing up, my dad being a football coach, he asked the same question of all the assistants that he ever hired: 'Is your goal to be a head football coach?'
You have some dark days and dark moments going through chemo and things like that.
If I can encourage and get somebody to get through what they're dealing with, their set of circumstances, that's the right thing to do.
I grew up in a football family, on the sideline. I was a waterboy. It was kinda something I was around my whole life.
I've always just tried to treat people with respect, build relationships with players and coaches... build a trust.
When you get chemo, some people get a lot of sores in their mouth and even their esophagus, so they chew on ice; thank God that didn't happen with me.
We have to know that nothing is promised, nothing is guaranteed, especially tomorrow.
I've always been a religious person.
When you have things taken away, you promise you'll never take anything for granted ever again.
I know that there are coaches who do end up sleeping on the sofa in their office.
