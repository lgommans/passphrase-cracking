There's no drama like wrestling.
I never told a joke in my life.
Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It's the real performers on the street who can hold people's attention and keep them from walking away.
There's no way to describe what I do. It's just me.
My mother sent me to psychiatrists since the age of four because she didn't think little boys should be sad. When my brother was born, I stared out the window for days. Can you imagine that?
While all the other kids were out playing ball and stuff, I used to stay in my room and imagine that there was a camera in the wall. And I used to really believe that I was putting on a television show and that it was going out to somewhere in the world.
What's real? What's not? That's what I do in my act, test how other people deal with reality.
I just want real reactions. I want people to laugh from the gut, be sad from the gut - or get angry from the gut.
If I play my cards right, I could bring network wrestling back to TV. Unfortunately, to most people, wrestling is a laughingstock. But fortunately, I'm reaching people who otherwise wouldn't watch it.
When I perform, it's very personal. I'm sharing things I like, inviting the audience into my room.
