Comedy is a shared experience, and I think it's great to open that to a wide demographic.
When I was a kid I went and saw Bill Cosby with my dad, and I remember sitting there and laughing so hard.
When I walk out on stage, I don't know who's in the audience. To me, in my little fat skull, the laugh is just the widest demographic you can get.
