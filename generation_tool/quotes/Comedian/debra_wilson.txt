American,Comedian
It's all about humanity, humility, and integrity.
I'm not the classic type - fair skin, very beautiful women of a classic type, I'm talking about now.
This business is all about being seen, and the more people see you the better.
There is a class system in acting just like in anything else. Black females fall in a category below black male actors.
I fit into the quirky, character class type of actor.
People who don't use the tools given to them only injure themselves.
My driving force is spirituality.
I have to approach my life in this way so I can do what I need to do, and do it very well.
Voice is my instrument.
I've played piano and guitar when I was younger.
My older sister Nikki went to Hampton music school in Virginia, then to another school later in New York.
And I used to listen to a lot of jazz.
Chick Corea was a great influence on me, musically, as I was growing up.
My family is very theatrical.
We always performed for our church, but we also just performed whenever the family got together.
I was a shy little girl, nothing like what I am now.
Singing was the big focus and outlet for me.
When I was five years old I knew I wanted to act.
I got an early education from television.
Watched Star Wars in 77 and that's when I got into watching films. I was just blown away by it.
I hated stand-up.
So many comics have such low self-esteem.
I face every project the same way - do it right and give 110%. 100% isn't good enough.
If you're going to do something, make it right and make it as good as you can. Don't waste anybody's time, especially your own.
