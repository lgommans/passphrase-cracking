Australian,Comedian
One of my biggest fears when I see really bad people on T.V. is that I don't know how they got there.
I'm just so comfortable talking about my private life: I just think because I'm not that clever.
If you live with someone that is depressed, the truth of it - it's not that dramatic, it's just a bit, kind of, 'Here we go, this is what we're doing today. This is sad. But we're gonna get through it.'
I usually live in my own ignorant, pop-culture bubble, so I don't really know what people are doing.
I like seeing comedians do stuff that I could never do.
I hate watching stand-ups.
Sitcom storylines are usually incredibly contrived.
My coming out was just so boring.
I'm very peculiar looking.
I can touch my eyebrows with my nose. Look at that! That's not normal. I shouldn't be able to do that.
Young people have grown up watching so much content, and just to find something that they haven't seen before: that's the dream. When you stumble across a show, and you say 'I haven't seen this,' that's what we want.
