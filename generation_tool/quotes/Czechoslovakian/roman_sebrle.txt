I am the type of guy that always looks into the future. But, of course, you never completely forget a javelin in your shoulder.
I looked at my shoulder and saw a javelin stuck in it. I was in shock.
If the javelin had hit me 10cm to the left, it would have punctured my lung, 20cm higher the throat, which would have been the worst-case scenario. Just 1cm higher and it would have hit bone, muscle and tendon and that would have been the end of my sporting career.
My position in the army is as sport instructor. This allows me generous time off for travel and competition. I also receive a monthly salary from the army.
I think I always prefer the long jump, high jump, and javelin. I don't like the 400 metres and the pole vault except when I'm really in shape.
During the decathlon, I always think only of the next event and my personal record.
