I worked in a boutique after work, my second job, selling women's clothes. And that was a way of not just making money but meeting women. That was very exciting job. I loved that job.
I had to succeed. Failure means I would have to be homeless again.
Financially I'm comfortable. But life has a lot more in store for me.
I don't walk around feeling like I'm successful. I feel like I did well.
If you like something, go for it.
