Italian,Designer
In the past, people were born royal. Nowadays, royalty comes from what you do.
That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live.
It is nice to have valid competition; it pushes you to do better.
I am not interested in the past, except as the road to the future.
I never fall down. I always fight.
I think it's the responsibility of a designer to try to break rules and barriers.
I have a fantastic relationship with money. I use it to buy my freedom.
I liked women as a shape to dress.
I'm a little like Marco Polo, going around and mixing cultures.
I want to be the joy to people through my work.
Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real.
I want always to be positive.
I don't license everywhere. I take care of my name.
I try to contrast; life today is full of contrast... We have to change.
For me, the summer will be pure gray - mother-of-pearl gray, very pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light blue, light turquoise, lots of pink.
My dream was always to be a composer, but fashion came very easily.
Designing came to me. I didn't have to move.
I am a typical Italian; I love the clan. But I don't think about getting married.
I really want to make clothes that are feminine and help women look beautiful.
I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.
Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes.
I want to be a designer for my time.
Women are more sure of themselves today. They don't have to emulate the way men dress.
