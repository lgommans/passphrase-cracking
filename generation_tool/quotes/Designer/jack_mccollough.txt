It's hard separating work from personal life.
I'm envious of actors. You shoot a movie or you do a season of 'Big Love,' and then you're on hiatus and you have a bunch of free time.
There are just so many young designers now.
You can always plan where you think your life is going to go but I don't think you can really plan your future.
