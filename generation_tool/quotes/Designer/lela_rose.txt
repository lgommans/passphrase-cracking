American,Designer
The wisest advice I ever received regarding the kitchen came from my mother: 'Do the dishes while you're cooking.'
The most overrated ingredients are garlic and extra-virgin olive oil. With garlic, it's personal; I have never been that big of a fan of its flavor. As for extra-virgin olive oil, I do use it quite often but its ubiquity serves to overshadow many wonderful oils like pistachio, walnut, argan and even grapeseed.
I bike around New York City as a way of getting everywhere I need to go.
Designing bridal is perfect for me, because black is my least favorite color, if you could call it a color.
For my kids, I cook everything. We have dinner every night, pretty much, just the four of us: my husband and me and our two kids.
I have always wanted to own a homemade ice cream shop!
My mother always taught me to wear clothes for myself and not to follow trends as trends will end!
I love to cook and entertain.
If you splurge, do it on an item that's fun, because you'll feel good whenever you put it on.
My culinary wardrobe is the same as my biking wardrobe, just no shoes.
The hands really show signs of age.
I really don't like take-out.
I'm a good skin, natural makeup kind of gal.
