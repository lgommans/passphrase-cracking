French,Designer
Never forget that what becomes timeless was once truly new.
I promised myself: Before your 18th birthday, you're going to be at Jean Paul Gaultier. And it worked. I was hired.
I grew up in a family that played golf, and my brother was much better than me, so I kind of put that aside. I had to be good at something other than golf.
Actually, I love golf clothes! I think this is the most interesting part of golf!
With my designs and my ideas, I want to please myself first.
I'm always very stressed about making a new proposition every season. But in a way, it's a kind of addiction.
People used to define me as a futurist designer, but, you know, the future is now for me.
What I find most interesting in fashion is that it has to reflect our time. You have to witness your own moment.
In this work, you have to convince everyone all the time, at different levels, to support your dream. I learned you have to be confident in order to do that.
In terms of design, it's true the world has an influence. But, as a designer, you have to protect yourself. You have to look at the world and then forget it.
Of course I live in my time, and I'm really curious. But, at the same time, I don't think it has a direct impact on my work.
Your priority has to be the creativity - and build a brand. That's what everybody did - Balenciaga, Dior, Saint Laurent. That's the smart thing to do.
I think the golden age of couture had some of the most incredible customers: women like Nan Kempner and all the icons.
There are people I've worked with who have never understood how fashion works. They keep saying they love fashion, yet they've never actually grasped that this isn't yoghurt or a piece of furniture - products in the purest sense of the term.
