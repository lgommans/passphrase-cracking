My mother is from Paris, so she was quite a fashion plate. I always had that French influence at home.
When I walk out on the street, I want to see everybody wearing my clothes.
I always had this thirst for excitement.
My last boyfriend used to always tell me, 'Grow up.' But I say, Why?
It's so boring to just hire a fancy caterer and have them do everything.
No matter what you do, black lace tends to look a little Spanish.
