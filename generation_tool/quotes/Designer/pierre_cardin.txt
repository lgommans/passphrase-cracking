My name is more important than myself.
I was very lucky, I was part of the post-war period when everything had to be redone.
I have a name, I have to take advantage of it.

They said pret-a-porter will kill your name, and it saved me.
The only one who is alive today and still being talked about is Pierre Cardin.
