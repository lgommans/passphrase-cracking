Shoes are the finishing touch on any outfit and it is important to complete a look with the perfect pair!
A statement necklace glams up any outfit without feeling like too much.
Trends have come and gone and they're coming back my way so I'm super excited about that.
Figuring out what to wear is much easier if you first think about what effect you want to create.
It's a big pay off when I see a woman wearing my stuff. It's really gratifying.
Every community has its own specialty and it's not just for clothing obviously, but for the home, etc.
You can make clothing as art, but I like the idea of my clothes actually being worn and being useful to women.
Every woman is not a runway model, nor should she be.
I'd like to be with an interesting man who is understanding about having a busy partner.
I did not have a big view of many designers until I got to high school.
The economy made me focus on designing more must-haves.
