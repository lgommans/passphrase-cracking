Chinese,Director
I like shooting movies in Thailand very much because the government is so cooperative there. The police help you to close the roads for shooting.
For John Woo, it is quite difficult to make a movie in Hollywood in his own style. Because Hollywood is based on a producer system, it is difficult for a director to express himself using his own style of filmmaking.
I think all the filmmakers in Hong Kong are influenced by John Woo.
I really have to say 'thank you' to our fans, because I think it's difficult for European viewers to find and watch Asian movies, and I hope you enjoy our films.
