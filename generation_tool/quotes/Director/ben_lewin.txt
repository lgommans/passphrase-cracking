Australian,Director
I'm what is known as a 40-year overnight success.
I have always enjoyed the company of women.
I am more connected to the world of the imagination, but you don't have to have polio to do that.
Particularly with middle-class people, self-absorption is a struggle.
I think people think filmmaking is fun, but I've never thought that. For me it's always been a lot of work and pain and stress.
When I watch a movie, I don't want to see the extra bits.
By the time I was a young man, I was pretty independent.
If you want a studio to back you, you want to be doing something that's been done to death!
If you look at the types of directors out there, I'm not as weird as most of them.
