French,Director
You have to know how to go against the trend of the times.
I think that high art reposes on popular art, without one there cannot be another.
I don't owe my success to state subsidies but to a faithful public which has sustained me.
I don't think that my films are 'literary'; they are based on the most ordinary things of life.
Western civilization shapes the content of my films, provides me with subjects that haven't been used before.
The French are very individualistic.
The French don't seek out alliances except when there are difficulties.
