It's more interesting for me as an audience member to see a movie about a loser.
Like any kind of writing, there are good days and frustrating days. But even frustrating days can be rewarding sometimes.
We wouldn't have done it if we didn't think we could have fun with it.
I mean, Joel talks to the actors more than I do and I probably do production stuff a little more than he does.

We tend to do period stuff because it helps make it one step removed from boring everyday reality.
The mountain music... is compelling music in its own right, harking back to a time when music was a part of everyday life and not something performed by celebrities.
Being non-commercial is never an ambition. Movies come together at different points for fortuitous reasons. You do them as you get the opportunity, as opposed to doing them when you choose to or design to.
When the movie's done, you talk about either the score or source music over a particular scene, what might work. You just throw a piece of music over the scene, and we both listen to it.
There aren't reasons why you like this song or this piece of music, or don't like it. It's just, it's either right or wrong, you know?
I have never had feeling in my toes. My uncle, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, once told me in confidence he had the same syndrome, leading me to believe it is genetic.
Dave Van Ronk, for those who don't know him - probably most don't know - was a folk singer. He's kind of the biggest person on the scene in 1961 in the folk revival in Greenwich Village, biggest person on the scene until Bob Dylan showed up.
