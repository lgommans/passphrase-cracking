I guess I need a hobby. Currently my primary hobby is complaining.
Filmmaking is a very complex form - ya know, acting, lighting, screenwriting, storytelling, music, editing - all these things have to come together.
Everyone I know who is having success in film right now is there because of persistence.
I loved movies. They inspired me more than anything growing up and wanted to do for others what those movies have done for me. I do a lot of other creative stuff but am not very good at it.
I went to film school at UT Austin. I learned a lot, and that school's good for puking up all your bad movies early and quick. But ultimately, no one can teach you to be an artist.
I do own a unicycle, which I use for workout purposes as opposed to doing tricks.
