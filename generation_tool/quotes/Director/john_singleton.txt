American,Director
Because, if I'm honest, people in the white world might be appalled, but in the black world, they're making myths out of me. And I know that ain't the life.
Crunk music is the music of the South, it pervades every club and nightclub not only in America, but all over the world.
I really took filmmaking very seriously... It was an honor and then a crutch also, because at a young age, I was like, I guess I'm a serious filmmaker. I never set out to be a serious filmmaker. I just set out to make movies.
I've become more relaxed. When I was younger, I had more erratic, nervous tension when I was working.
Cinema was my rite of passage.
The freshest moments in my films have always been with unknown actors.
I already have legitimacy as a filmmaker and now I'm trying to do stuff that's just fun. Until I find a cool tangible subject again that I want to tackle.
'Baby Boy' is one of my favourite films, and Tyrese keeps telling everybody we're going to make a sequel. I mean, we have a story right now but we don't know where we're going to take it.
I love comics. I like to do everything I used to do when I was 14-years-old.
I try to keep focused on the things that really make me happy and just do those same things.
I wanted to dress cool, and get all the ladies.
I've been nominated for Academy Awards, I know what I'm doing.
It's cool for me because I'm a director, but I'm also a teacher. I'm a lover of cinema, and I love working with people who are hungry and have the energy to really do better work.
I've got passion, and for people who don't, I make them see how trite their lives are.
I'm a competitive guy.
We have these rules, the 'hero rules.' Like, a hero doesn't slouch. A hero walks proudly with his head up. A hero walks with a purpose. A hero's always a gentleman.
Now, I'm so relaxed that I have to make myself nervous. I feel better when I'm second and third guessing myself over everything. I play with the mice in my head, all the time.
