Theatre has so many competitors, it's no longer enough to see and hear a play. You want to be able to touch and smell it, too.
People are so accustomed now to social networking. Now everybody has custom-made news for him or her. So everybody is a content maker and a content reactor.
If you want to get into the shoes of someone, it's not just about seeing and hearing. It is also about what you touch and what you smell. Smell is so specific and so powerful. And this is the beauty of immersive theatre - it's something you cannot get in any other art form. I think this is the real future for theatre.
Once you get used to censorship, sometimes you self-censor.
Art is where we make a stand. If we don't make it there, freedom of expression is lost for everyone - for artists, for journalists, and for everyday people.
