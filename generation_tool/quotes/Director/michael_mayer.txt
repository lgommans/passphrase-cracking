Life is too short to do anything that's not challenging.
I haven't read a single word that a critic has written about me since 1994.
I feel like I've been blessed.
I didn't really chart things out, career-wise.
'Rigoletto' has long been one of my favorite operas, and it was on my short list way back when I first talked to Peter Gelb. I started thinking about what I could bring to this masterpiece, which has been seen all over the world for so many years.
