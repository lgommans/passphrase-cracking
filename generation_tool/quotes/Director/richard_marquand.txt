British,Director
I was a great admirer of George Lucas' work.
I am a tremendous 'Star Wars' fan; I know the story means an enormous love to me. I love the characters.
I'm very interested in directing actors - many directors direct cameras.
It's my life. I only got one, and it's very short. You don't get long.
