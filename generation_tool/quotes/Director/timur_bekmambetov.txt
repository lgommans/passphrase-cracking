Director
Every commercial covers different ground, different ideas, and it's my profession to direct and to tell stories - for me, it's very organic.
I also have experience working with American producer Roger Corman who knows a lot of secrets in making movies look bigger than their budget.
It's a big problem for American movies that all their movies are produced to be global.
If I've seen the movie, it means it's an influence on my own filmmaking. Every movie has a reflection in 'Night Watch.'
'Night Watch' itself is a very Russian movie. It's impossible to imagine this kind of movie somewhere else: a movie with a depressing ending, a lot of inexplicable storylines, strange characters. It's a Russian reflection of American film culture.
I think the most important technique is to ground everything, to make everything - to make fantasy world grounded and relatable, just great characters.
Good fighters, they are so professional and quick, you can't see what's happening. It's very important: the fight is like a dialogue. Everybody has a line and an answer.
If you know exactly what your character knows, it's a drama.
