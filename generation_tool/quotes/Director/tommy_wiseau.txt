Director
I'm not a god, I'm just a simple guy.
I inspire myself.
I am pro-freedom.
We have many Lisas, Marks, Dennys, Johnnys, and other characters from 'The Room' in America and in the entire world.
My background is in psychology and I'm also a stage actor. That's my background.
Express yourself, don't hurt yourself.
As a director, I have to feel realism from actors, and they can't be plastic.
I am pro-expression. I am pro - you know, as long as you don't hurt anyone.
I like a lot of classic movies, like, for example, 'Citizen Kane', James Dean movies, etc, etc.
I'm not here to criticize anyone.
I want to be always actor.
When people sometimes misquote me, I don't know if they understand what I'm saying.
When I was a little kid, I wanted to be, like, you know, a movie star, you know? Or, I always have interest in movie, you know? Because I like the visual aspect of the movies, et cetera.
I'm satisfied with the way 'The Room' turned out, and I don't want to change anything.
You cannot have the drama without comedy.
I like vampires.
All topics, issues, and subjects in 'The Room' add to the depth of the characters in the movie, and they are equally important.
When I was little kid, I used to want to be a rock star.
I'm going to do more movies and travel.
As a filmmaker and an actor, my job is to react towards people, but I want a reaction from them.
As a director, it's my job to provoke, and when people decided 'The Room' be called a phenomenon, or whatever you call it, it's fine with me.
I studied movies for many years, but I am professionally an actor because I, my background is actually a stage actor and acting.
I like acting better than anything else, but, you know, directing's good.
I always say that you don't have to like 'The Room', but you will discover something - maybe a tiny little thing - and say, 'Wait a minute, maybe I want to see more.'
