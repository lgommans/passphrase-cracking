German,Driver
No matter how good a driver you are, you have to have the right car and the right team behind you in order to succeed.
Pressure is always a part of a racing driver's life, but my father helped me a lot on my way to becoming a F1 driver.
I am a demanding person to interview.
I remember my father's last race very clearly when he drove at Hockenheim in front of 100,000 people and I was sitting next to him on the roof of his car and waving to the fans. That was the moment when I thought: 'One day I want to do the same.'
Image has an influence on what sort of car I will get to drive or deals that I'm offered by teams.
For me it was a normality having a father who was a world champion. I grew up with that, so it was never extra pressure. And I've never felt the need to emerge from his shadow.
Winning at Monaco feels unbelievable, because it's such a special race and it's also my home race. My first memories were of watching Ayrton Senna here with his yellow helmet, and one day dreaming to win the Monaco GP.
It is a burden because I get asked about my father all the time. I just need to accept that he was a champion before me.
My dad is a great manager. He's not just competent - he's very clever.
People in Finland have also adopted me because of my dad, and that's great, but it's the one language I can't speak.
It's very, very special for me. This is where I've grown up, it's my home, and winning the Monaco Grand Prix is the highlight of any racing driver's career and for me a childhood dream. It being my home makes it all the more special, unbelievable.
