We adore chaos because we love to produce order.
Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible. I think it's in my basement... let me go upstairs and check.
Are you really sure that a floor can't also be a ceiling?
My work is a game, a very serious game.
He who wonders discovers that this in itself is wonder.
I don't use drugs, my dreams are frightening enough.
