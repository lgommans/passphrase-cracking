Science fiction is about worlds you don't know and worlds you can create, like in 'Avatar'.
I had decided after 'Hollow Man' to stay away from science fiction. I felt I had done so much science fiction. Four of the six movies I made in Hollywood are science-fiction oriented, and even 'Basic Instinct' is kind of science fiction.
Jesus may have had an immense sense of importance or destiny, but he never claimed to be the Son of God.
Jesus was a human being, bound by history and the natural world; an extraordinary man, to be sure, but still a man.
My first film was a comedy, but after that I went always into more heavier stuff.
I had become a film director because I thought I could express something in an artful way.
