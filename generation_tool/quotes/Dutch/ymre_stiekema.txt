When you model for a show, you get this real sense of adrenaline. It's difficult when the shoes are so high - that part's quite scary - but you just have to do it.
Prada is such a huge company, and it was an honour to work with them and so early on in my career.
Doing something for Victoria's Secret would be great - I love Doutzen Kroes. She's so special to look at but seems like a very normal person. She's true to herself - that's important to me.
I'd love to do a big hair campaign for L'Oreal, and Prada would be great, too, obviously.
