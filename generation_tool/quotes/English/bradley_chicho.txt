English,Poet
Highest of heights, I climb this mountain and feel one with the rock and grit and solitude echoing back at me.
The friendship we share grows amidst the craggy rock pond; reeds of water spray fireflies scented with bonfires.
Drag me to the moon, to catch a star and seize its brilliance as I'm swept up in amorphous dust.
Surrender the vert platonic bond tying your soul to mine craft, the sky fades a pink shadow cast.
Plunderous is the palate I gift to you, openly I hug the universe of our friendship expanding its outer limit.
Grey cloth coaxes the lime trees of friends shadowing berries dropped by the grateful earth.
Declare this smite time, extracting precious gems and wholly hours you share to fruitcake a friend so dear.
Shine like the day I set cosmic eyes on you, friend, by the light of the sweet squash in my lovely laser broom.
The joys of friendship inert the heart and fizzy home bouncing jubilantly with laughter-buttered love.
Companions are we, enlivened by a mighty gallop quickly sliding a harsh straw basket of sea foam gathered astride the tide.
Blunders, no, only friendship binds us to honesty - attracting crypts of mushrooms in the wake of our snowboards.
I delight in the sweet and sour moments we routinely share, together applauded by muppets in leotards.
Shy is the oyster, fervent is the clam, peaceful is the ocean floor rocked by the sands of time.
Bits and pieces flung into the universe, sticking in the sky like cotton balls on a jet black velcro surface.
