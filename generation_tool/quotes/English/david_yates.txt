English,Director
In an ideal world, I'd bounce between big projects and no-budget TV dramas with fantastic scripts.
You never want to be the director who dropped the ball, you know?
I'm a Harry Potter fan.
I like humor.
Personally, I read a lot of scripts.
I love 'The Stand;' I read it when I was a kid - it was one of my favorite books when I was growing up. I love Stephen King; I think he's a remarkable writer.
I like happy sets. Happy sets are good, and I think people feel comfortable on them.
I like to create an atmosphere where actors feel safe enough to take risks.
A lot of Hollywood films tend to be bloated, bombastic, loud. At the same time, I do like the infrastructure of making a blockbuster; it's like having a big train set.
