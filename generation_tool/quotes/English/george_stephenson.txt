English,Inventor
The rage for railroads is so great that many will be laid in parts where they will not pay.
I am glad to learn that the Parliament Bill has been passed for the Darlington Railway.
The principles upon which a safety lamp might be constructed I stated to several persons long before Sir Humphrey Davy came into this part of the country.
I am much obliged by the favourable sentiments you express towards me, and shall be happy if I can be of service in carrying into execution your plans.
