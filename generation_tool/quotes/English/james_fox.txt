English,Actor
I'm very emotional, very explosive, very temperamental.
People think 'Performance' blew my mind... my mind was blown long before that.
'Performance' gave me doubts about my way of life. Before that, I had been completely involved in the more bawdy side of the film business. But after that, everything changed.
There's often an assumption you're more privileged if you belong to a family with people who have made a success.
I'm lucky I've been able to spend a lot of time with my family.
Childhood is so important. Without a loving one, you're vulnerable throughout your life. We're all the things our parents are - the good and the not so good. Thankfully, I have a wonderful wife who's a brilliant mother.
