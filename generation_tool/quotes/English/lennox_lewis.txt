I've got a new life now, a new future, there's a lot more to Lennox Lewis than just being a boxer.
It's not rage that drives me, it's competition.
In boxing you create a strategy to beat each new opponent, it's just like chess.
If the money's right, I'm happy to bust up the other side of his face... No problem.
I have been in there with all of them and there is nothing left for me to prove.
The fight will last as long as I allow it to last, and then I will knock him out.
People know I was the last true champion.
During the past 23 years, I have set a number of goals for myself and I'm proud to say that these goals have been achieved.
Now I am ready to set new goals and start a new career for myself outside of the ring.
Whatever I do, I always want to get better.
My main goal was to win all the belts, and I have done that.
After you win all these belts, you cannot fight all these mandatory guys.
You can just fight one man at a time.
So, I gave my belts out to others to give them a chance.
When you go into the other guy's backyard you cannot hope to win on points.
If the media didn't know I played chess, there'd be no angle on me at all.
I just want to complete my legacy.
I wanted to prove I was the best fighter in the world.
The mission I set out on in the beginning - to become heavyweight champion of the world, undisputed, lineal champion - you could say that mission is complete.
I don't have anything else to prove.
I've worked hard and accomplished what I've accomplished in the heavyweight scene.
When you look back in history and see other fighters coming back, it's never really been good for them.
If I don't feel the same hunger as I once did then I definitely shouldn't box any more.
I always ask myself why old heavyweights come back, but I plan to stay out of the ring.
