English,Actor
I'm a typical guy. Driving cars and speed are really fun.
I like playing heavy metal music and pretending I'm a vampire in front of the mirror.
I steal things from people, characteristics, and I just stock them in my head like a library to use for characters in the future.
That's why I enjoy acting: getting in the mind of someone else.
