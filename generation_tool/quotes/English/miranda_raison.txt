I haven't done as much proper travelling as I'd like to have done. However, I know how important the weather is for my mood and spirits.
I'm really into beaches, but I also enjoy a bit of culture. An ideal holiday would have a nice balance of the two, but I'm definitely not into adrenalin sports, nor would I enjoy spending a month solid on a beach.
I do read on holiday, but it tends to be very lowbrow. I'm into really camp biographies, and I'm a shameless fan of Jilly Cooper.
I'm a bad traveller because I suffer from travel sickness.
My mum lives near Holkham Bay in Norfolk, and with my dad by the coast in Suffolk, I spend quite a bit of time by the sea.
Filming 'Doctor Who' is so incredibly different to 'Spooks.' Near to the surface, there's quite a silly atmosphere. A lot of the times, you're on the verge of giggles because it's so over the top.
I've had more fan mail from 'Doctor Who' than anything. People love the show so passionately.
I was genuinely frightened when I saw the Daleks. These ridiculous-looking things absolutely get to the core of you when you're standing in front of one.
My favourite programme of all time is 'Weeds'; the first three or four series are perfection.
A lot of shows peak after a series and never get it back, but 'Breaking Bad' keeps the tension up all the time.
Most shows find themselves descending into sentimentality or earnestness at some point but, with 'Community,' the joke is always on.
