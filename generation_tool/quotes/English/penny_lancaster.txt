As long as you try your best, that is all that matters. You don't have to be the fastest runner or top of the class.
I'm a pretty organised traveller.
There's less pressure to look good as you get older.
I'm lucky that I have a supportive partner who loves me when I'm bigger as well as slim.
I do love fish, and I thought it was healthy without understanding the high mercury levels that fish like tuna, swordfish and halibut can contain.
If I had a partner who asked when I was going to the gym or commented that I was eating too much or asked if I really needed an extra potato, that would make me feel awful. It would be terrible.
I modelled in my 20s, and it was an obsessive time. I was under pressure to look a certain way.
I really do believe that being naturally beautiful is what is inside and what shines through.
I think there's always interest in how the other half live - I see myself as a down-to-earth Essex mum who just happens to be living this very glamorous life in Beverly Hills.
