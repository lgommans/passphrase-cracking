English,Actor
My parents would have loved me to go to university - Oxbridge, particularly.
I was never a juvenile lead or a romantic hero, and I didn't come into my own as an actor until I was 40.
I have a rubbery face.
I was not easy to cast, but also, I have never been typecast.
People who are seriously damaged by sudden fame and notoriety have, in my experience, very low esteem at the root of their being.
To walk out on a marriage and leave a child was painful.
I was so determined not to pass on to my children what I perceived to be the faults of my upbringing.
Of course, I've known people who have mental difficulties, so I know how fragile people's psyches are and how little it can take to overbalance somebody.
