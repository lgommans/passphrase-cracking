When I was studying, I was part of a children's entertainment company, and I'd have to dress up as a pirate or fairy and go to corporate parties and entertain the children. I will never, ever do that again. The worst was the demanding children - I've never been so exhausted doing a job as that one.
My first job was playing 'Nurse 2' in a film by Ben Elton called 'Maybe Baby,' and the first actors I worked with professionally were Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson. I was totally star-struck. I got that job on my final day of drama school, so it was a nice bridge into the professional world.
I had periods when I was out of work, and I still do - I just don't worry about them as much any more.
I'll go wherever the work takes me. If something comes along that feels right, the family will come with me.
