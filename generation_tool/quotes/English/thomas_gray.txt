English,Poet
Where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise.
Commerce changes the fate and genius of nations.
Youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.
Poetry is thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.
Alas, regardless of their doom, the little victims play! No sense have they of ills to come, nor care beyond today.
And weep the more, because I weep in vain.
Visions of glory, spare my aching sight.
If the best man's faults were written on his forehead, he would draw his hat over his eyes.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
'Tis folly to be wise.
He gave to misery (all he had) a tear.
Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune, he had not the method of making a fortune.
I shall be but a shrimp of an author.
