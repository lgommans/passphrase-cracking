Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and aesthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient.
In June as many as a dozen species may burst their buds on a single day. No man can heed all of these anniversaries; no man can ignore all of them.
One swallow does not make a summer, but one skein of geese, cleaving the murk of March thaw, is the Spring.
