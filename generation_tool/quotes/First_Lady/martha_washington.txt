American,First Lady
I am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself. For I have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition.
I've learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances.
The greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not our circumstances.
I live a very dull life here... indeed I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else.
The greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances. We carry the seeds of the one or the other about with us in our minds wherever we go.
