American,First Lady
I never have tantrums. If anything makes me mad, I'm silent. If I'm not talking, leave me alone.
I've been blessed with a wonderful husband, two caring daughters and sons-in-law, and four really special grandchildren. They have each enhanced my life.
I feel there's enough seriousness in the world without seeing it in the theatre.
I have made my own decisions ever since my father died.
I'm a perfectionist. I won't do a thing without trying to do it well.
I always look forward, not back.
I have sacrificed everything in my life that I consider precious to advance the political career of my husband.
Being first lady is the hardest unpaid job in the world.
I'll have to have a room of my own. Nobody could sleep with Dick. He wakes up during the night, switches on the lights, speaks into his tape recorder.
I only know what I read in the papers.
I didn't know what it was not to work hard as I grew up.
I don't have time to be depressed.
If I had a choice, I'd rather be admired less and have my husband tormented less. I'd prefer that people concentrate on a fair assessment of him and his Presidency.
All lives have triumphs and tragedies, laughter and tears, and mine has been no different.
All lives have triumphs and tragedies, laughter and tears, and mine has been no different. What really matters is whether, after all of that, you remain strong and a comfort to your loved ones. I have tried to meet that test.
I have always tried my best to do what I thought was the right thing at the time.
I think a person has to just be herself.
I'd like to work on job and educational opportunities for all.
I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with.
I never had time to dream about being anyone else.
It takes heart to be in political life.
I love my husband. I believe in him, and I am proud of his accomplishments.
I do or die, but I never cancel out.
I have a very positive outlook.
The truth sustains me.
