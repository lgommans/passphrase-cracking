French,Politician
I would like to stress this point undoubtedly: France sees the Arab Spring as auspicious. The Arab Spring holds out tremendous hope - hope for democracy and the rule of law, hope for peace and stability, hope for better future in which every person can pursue goals commensurate with his or her needs, talents and ambitions.
Any confrontation, such as a verbal one with the United States, would be harmful for everybody.
The people have spoken. Their decision is sovereign. We all respect it... I wish good luck to those who will now govern France.
For me, the country where I feel good, where I feel in harmony with the lifestyle and fundamental values, is the United States - more than any other country.
Sometimes I say in France: Europe is no more the center of the world - and the United States, neither. We have other key players on the international stage: China, of course; but also Brazil, India and South Africa. And their influence is very, very strong.
The French are very bizarre. There is this collective depiction: 'We're in decline, we're being assailed, we must protect ourselves.'
In politics, one is never finished. Look at me!
