French,Athlete
I'm certain I can be the fastest in the world.
My dad was very into cycling and had lots of magazines around the house. So I knew about the best cyclists of that era: Arnaud Tournant, Laurent Gane. I watched a lot of the Tour de France and the Tour of Spain with him.
I started as a road cyclist and did all types apart from BMX. I started doing a lot of competitions, and then my dad suggested I tried the track. At first the thought of falling is scary, but you realise soon that if you go fast enough, you'll be fine. I realised it was more than a hobby when I was 16.
It is still difficult being a black cyclist. There are people who say bad things to you that they won't to a white person. It is stupid that that is the case, but your skin colour is there, and some people judge you on that.
