French,Poet
When truth is no longer free, freedom is no longer real: the truths of the police are the truths of today.
An orange on the table, your dress on the rug, and you in my bed, sweet present of the present, cool of night, warmth of my life.
Even if happiness forgets you a little bit, never completely forget about it.
Love is so simple.
Our Father which art in heaven - Stay there - And we will stay on earth - Which is sometimes so pretty.
