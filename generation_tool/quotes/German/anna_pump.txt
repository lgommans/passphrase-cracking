I love simple foods as well as grand. Dinners that take a half-hour from skillet to plate are as important as a five-course dinner. A meal that can materialize in an hour and be presented with care, love and pride is something every busy person longs to be able to do.
My mother could make something out of nothing - and everything started from scratch.
I am not a chef. I can't claim that title. The difference is a cook doesn't have a degree. A chef has formal education. It has nothing to do with talent or actual preparation - one just can't claim the title if you don't have degree.
We must make organic and farm-raised costs more affordable. We need to come to a level where people who don't have a lot of money can afford it. If we could eat just fresh foods, it would be wonderful.
