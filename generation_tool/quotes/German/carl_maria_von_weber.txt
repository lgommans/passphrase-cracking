German,Composer
What love is to man, music is to the arts and to mankind.
An artist's sphere of influence is the world.
What love is to man, music is to the arts and to mankind. Music is love itself - it is the purest, most ethereal language of passion, showing in a thousand ways all possible changes of color and feeling; and though true in only a single instance, it yet can be understood by thousands of men - who all feel differently.
