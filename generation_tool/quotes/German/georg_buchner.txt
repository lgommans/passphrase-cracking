German,Dramatist
We are only puppets, our strings are being pulled by unknown forces.
Revolution is like Saturn, it devours its own children.
A good man with a good conscience doesn't walk so fast.
One must love humanity in order to reach out into the unique essence of each individual: no one can be too low or too ugly.
Peace to the shacks! War on the palaces!
That is a long word: forever!
Dying people often become childish.
Death is the most blessed dream.
Whoever finishes a revolution only halfway, digs his own grave.
We are always on stage, even when we are stabbed in earnest at the end.
There are only Epicureans, either crude or refined; Christ was the most refined.
They say in the grave there is peace, and peace and the grave are one and the same.
How many women does one need to sing the scale of love all the way up and down?
Love is a peculiar thing.
Your words smell of corpses.
The life of the wealthy is one long Sunday.
We have not made the Revolution, the Revolution has made us.
Government must be a transparent garment which tightly clings to the people's body.
The strides of humanity are slow, they can only be counted in centuries.
The world is chaos. Nothingness is the yet-to-be-born god of the world.
I'll know how to die with courage; that is easier than living.
The revolutionary government is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.
The weapon of the Republic is terror, and virtue is its strength.
The death clock is ticking slowly in our breast, and each drop of blood measures its time, and our life is a lingering fever.
Raise your eyes and count the small gang of your oppressors who are only strong through the blood they suck from you and through your arms which you lend them unwillingly.
The breath of an aristocrat is the death rattle of freedom.
