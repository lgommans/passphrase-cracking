The blood pigment haemoglobin is a compound which can be split by diverse methods into its constituents, pigment and protein.
In cases of porphyria, a minor disease, the patient excretes large quantities of porphyrins.
Coproporphyrin in particular is widespread; traces are present in normal urine and also in yeast. In special cultures, yeast can be made to produce considerable quantities of coproporphyrin.
If we introduce iron complexly into ooporphyrin, we obtain haemin.
