German,Sculptor
Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation.
Art is a fruit that grows in man, like a fruit on a plant, or a child in its mother's womb.
