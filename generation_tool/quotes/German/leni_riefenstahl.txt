Through my optimism I naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life.
The applause was so loud and insistent that I had to respond with several encores. I was numb with happiness, when it was over, I knew that this alone must be my life and my world.
I feel as though I have lived many lives, experienced the heights and depths of each and like the waves of the ocean, never known rest. Throughout the years, I have looked always for the unusual, for the wonderful, for the mysteries at the heart of life.
I am fascinated by what is beautiful, strong, healthy, what is living. I seek harmony.
I set about seeking a thread, a theme, a style, in the realm of legend. Something that might allow me to give free rein to my juvenile sense of romanticism and the beautiful image.
Reality doesn't interest me.
I want to see, that's all. This is my life. I want to see.
