German,Athlete
I have one of the most beautiful places in the world in Orange County. That's a great place to live.
What is different is I am giving the kids a chance to train every day. Not only once a day, but sometimes when they do not have school, we will try to do something in the morning too.
What we are missing over here is the life of soccer.
In Europe, it's different - you eat soccer, you breathe soccer, you drink soccer. Everything is about soccer.
A lot of kids do not know my club exists yet. I did not do any big advertising, and that's what I might do in the next two or three weeks, put something in the paper.
People have to pay a lot of money to play soccer here.
I want to spend more time with those kids. I want to dedicate my time to train those kids and teach them what it takes, what they need to do to get to this level.
If I would take a job with a professional league, I need to be ready.
One is my club, I want to develop those players, and I want to be in the beginning at least, until I have everything ready, I want to spend as much time to develop those kids as possible.
The other thing is I don't want to move any more. I have moved so many times in my life.
I could stay in Germany and start my coaching career there. I did not want to.
If I am taking a job, I really want to do it 100% on a daily basis, and that's not what I can do right now.
