Greek,Philosopher
Appearances are a glimpse of the unseen.
Everything has a natural explanation. The moon is not a god, but a great rock, and the sun a hot rock.
Men would live exceedingly quiet if these two words, mine and thine, were taken away.
The seed of everything is in everything else.
The descent to Hades is the same from every place.
It is not I who have lost the Athenians, but the Athenians who have lost me.
