Greek,Leader
We are given to the cult of personality; when things go badly we look to some messiah to save us. If by chance we think we have found one, it will not be long before we destroy him.
You do what you have to do in life, when you form a philosophy that you can't talk yourself out of.
People who decide they came to earth to work, who make work their personal philosophy, are kept very busy.
