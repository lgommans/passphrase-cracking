Greek,Royalty
Growing up, it was very clear that I was a member of a royal family with a potential function later on. The question was: when and how and if?
Greeks have always been very confident, very strong people. That is - that is our real, I guess, benefit, is that we are independent thinkers. We will always get up on our feet. We - we sometimes act the best when we are downtrodden.
