There are hurdles, there are handicaps, hardships you have to face in life, but you hope for a great future.
Everyone starts a film thinking that it would be a big hit. But sometimes it goes haywire.
I ran away from my house when I was about 12 years old to audition for a film.
Instead of focusing on my looks I focus on the character that I am playing.
An outsider can see some things much better.
Not exactly but I get inspiration from stories which are unconventional.
I have lot of respect of filmmakers who work in Telugu and Tamil.
But it is not conscious strategy to go for unconventional roles.
If you make a feelgood film which is complete candyfloss, where everybody is good and everything is beautiful and hunky dory, it won't appeal to the audience.
India has the purity, the innocence. India knows what it wants. There is a direction. It has so much to offer.
In India I've been to all the award functions, but that was in Hindi; now it's in English so it's a much bigger scale.
