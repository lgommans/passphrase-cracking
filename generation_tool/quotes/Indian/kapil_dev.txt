Apart from education, you need good health, and for that, you need to play sports.
If you play good cricket, a lot of bad things get hidden.
Irrespective of any political party, I am a supporter of good people who want to do something for the society.
The next generation has always been and will be better than the previous one. If it is not, then the world would not be moving forward.
All you have to do is to dream big and try to fulfil it.
Though teenagers are generally very interested in sports, they must realise that education is the most important thing in their lives. They must find the right balance.
Selectors can't please everyone, but I am OK if they are working for the benefit of Indian cricket. It's an administrative decision to appoint a selection committee, and I would like to let them do their job.
I always breathe cricket.
My best wishes are with Indian cricket in general. I wish each one of our cricketers success at the international and domestic level.
When you are growing up, everyone will help you. When you reach the top, everyone will start pulling you down. The same people who help you will be the same people who try to pull you down.
Sports should not become routine. It should be about passion.
Let me clarify it through the national news agency that I am not joining Aam Aadmi Party. There has been reports that I will be officially joining AAP, but I can assure you that nothing of that sort is happening.
I have played cricket on my own terms.
I don't look into negative things. Go past mistakes and look forward.
I feel that World Cup cricket should be played like football in which all the 160 countries take part. If only a handful of countries are going to keep on playing in the World Cup without making the game popular, I will be a sad man.
The hunger to win must not die... The appetite has to remain big.
Every person gets negative things, they learn from those negative things, and you become a positive person.
I was a naughty kid. Teachers did not like me much.
As I enter a new phase of life and my circle broadens, I start learning new things.
If you are playing on a turning wicket, toss plays an important role. The team that wins the toss gets an opportunity to play on the fresh wicket. You should always prepare the wicket as per team's strength. But a rank turner might backfire.
Cricket is very simple... you play till you can sustain.
Fast bowling is an art, like spin bowling.
It is always nice when you are honoured. The Lifetime award makes me feel old. I am only 55.
As an Indian, I would like to back my government.
If your work becomes a source of enjoyment and a challenge, it will never seem like work - it will be fun. If you ever feel that your work is a burden, there is no point carrying on with it.
In the long run, I believe that honesty is definitely the best policy. One can get away by being dishonest for a short term, but ultimately, honesty is what pays.
When you take risks and things don't go your way, you can be heavily criticised by the media.
I am not too intelligent.
I think pride is more important sometimes than making money.
People often ask me whether I believe in God. I haven't seen God. But I think that one's beliefs are one's God - and, in those terms, yes, God is there.
Spirituality lies in what you do and how you do it and not what result you get.
Test cricket is a different sort of cricket altogether. Some players who are good for one-day cricket may be a handicap in a Test match.
The West Indians and Pakistanis play one-day cricket so well because they play for English counties.
Cricket has become more popular, not me... When the game grows, those who've played it also 'grow.'
One can't feel old in a day or overnight!
