Indian,Activist
I had a clear vision: if I take up an assignment, I'll do full justice to it; otherwise I'll walk away.
The focus is what is right before you - to give it your best. It sows the seeds of tomorrow.
I believe in prayer. I believe in gratitude and serving people.
My policing was nothing but activism - it had to be.
