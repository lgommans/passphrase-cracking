Indonesian,Author
I'll do as I please. My mind is not to be imprisoned.
I happen to be pretty productive when I am in jail. When you are in jail, you have to spend more time with yourself.
Even though no one admits it, writers are leaders in their communities.
I don't write to give joy to readers but to give them a conscience.
Every award for me is important because it means a slap against militarism and fascism in Indonesia.
Every book that is banned is a badge of honor.
I don't follow any kind of 'isms.' If there is one, it will be Pram-ism.
Let us see whether it is the New Order or me who will be the loser before Indonesian history. I have won. The New Order has fallen and my writings have been translated into 40 languages.
