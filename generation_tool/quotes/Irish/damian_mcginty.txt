Irish,Actor
Obviously I like pretty girls, but I'm also looking for someone who can take control. I know guys complain about girls telling them what to do, but I think we all kind of enjoy it.
I need a girl who will put me in my place, but I also want to laugh and have a good time.
Every performer can get better. It's not about staying with what God gave you and doing nothing with it for the rest of your life.
Growing up, I always wanted to sing.
I live in Derry, a little town in Ireland, and I don't have the background of Hollywood or Broadway.
