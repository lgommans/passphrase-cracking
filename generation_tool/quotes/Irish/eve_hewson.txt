Irish,Actress
There were times when I wondered if I was doing the right thing, studying when I could have been going to auditions.
I don't get handed money - and I never will. I have to work!
In my family, I would never dare to think of being Paris Hilton! And to me, that doesn't look like a happy existence - it's just not who I am.
That's the thing about acting - you can't fake it.
No one knows who I am and no-one cares. I could jump in front of a camera man and he'd just tell me to get out of the way.
I get called 'Memphis Eve,' but my first name is Eve. I know Memphis is in there somewhere, but on my passport I'm 'Eve Sunny Day Hewson.'
I always wanted to go to Sundance.
