Irish,Athlete
It will be difficult to let go but it is going to happen sooner rather than later in my case.
I became more confident within myself and matured as a person and become a little bit more opinionated - maybe the lads might say a little bit too opinionated for their liking but that is just a natural progression for a player.
I wouldn't even mention myself in the same breath as someone like big Paul.
He was a fantastic player, but the thing that impressed me most about Paul was his manner off the pitch. He was always very humble about his achievements and had a lot of time for the paying public and people in general.
Looking back I find it hard to believe that I could forge a career in anything other than football but I didn't do too badly in my final exams and there were a few business-related courses that interested me.
I am hugely proud to have played for Ireland.
I never felt I would get to the stage where I would to have to actively think about retiring from international football as I always thought it would pass me by.
I never felt I would be part of the international scene for 50 caps in my wildest dreams.
I definitely want to be involved but only while I think I can make a contribution and I make a difference.
I enjoyed seven years at Wimbledon and there were high and low points.
