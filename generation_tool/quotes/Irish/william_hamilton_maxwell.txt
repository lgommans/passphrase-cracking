Irish,Novelist
The country is in an extraordinary ferment.
Billing and cooing to me is worse to witness an execution.
Irishmen are not reserved, and the company appeared dying to be intimately acquainted.
I am naturally taciturn, and became a silent and attentive listener.
Never were two people more opposite in sentiment than my companions.
