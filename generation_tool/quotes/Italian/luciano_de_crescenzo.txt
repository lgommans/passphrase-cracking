We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.
I have a concept of Naples that is not so much of a city, per se, but rather an ingredient of the human spirit that I detect in everyone, Neapolitan or not. The idea that 'Neapolitanism' and mass ignorance are somehow indissolubly linked is one that I am prepared to fight with all the strength I have.
Neapolitans have always had their fast food. It's called pizza.
