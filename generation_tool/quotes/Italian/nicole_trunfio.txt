Italian,Model
I look up to people that are much older than me, so being a mentor is a full time job.
My mentors in life are much older than me and have been through life. They can actually give me some sound advice on what I'm going through.
I love the feel of good quality Italian black lace that feels delicate and really feminine.
Occasionally I will audition for a big overseas movie, but that's it.
I try to go to the gym three to four times a week and mix it up with yoga or a personal trainer.
I truly love Australia; I miss Aussie kids and their attitude!
I love not having a daily routine, just having the things I need with me and going anywhere in the world.
I like pieces that are cool and simple. I try to wear really cute things, but they just don't suit me at all.
Skin is really important; after all, it's my business.
My big break was when I won 'Search for a Supermodel Australia,' and then I came second in the world series, and that was all good, but I was just having fun; it wasn't real to me.
I get recognised in America.
Because I come from such a close family, my natural instinct is to marry and have kids as soon as possible.
I could definitely see myself living back in Australia again. If I had a family, I could move back.
I live in New York. I have an amazing apartment over there; I have this amazing life over there that's full of glamour. I get treated like a queen over there - and that's one of the reasons I love coming home. It's very grounding.
My weight is something that people seem to talk about a lot.
I haven't looked to my peers for advice because we're all going through the same thing. How do you ask your friends for advice when they're going through the exact same thing?
I have such a passion for theatre.
I will pursue my passion of cooking every day until my hands fall off and I lose all sense of smell and taste.
