Jamaican,Athlete
Sometimes I'm at home and I remember I'm supposed to do 100 push-ups and I don't.
Many track and field people know that if I stay relaxed and run my race like I'm supposed to, I will be the winner at the Olympic Games.
I just want to give my best in London, I want to cross that line and see a personal best on the clock then I will see what position I am in.
I am a bit different from the other sprinters because, I would say, I can run many different ways while the other guys they just came on and they can only run one way.
I should just stay composed and run to the finish line.
Over the years I have been kind of lazy, thinking my talent alone can do it.
I am trying to attend every training session and do all of my workouts.
From Day 1 I wasn't planning to run until I am very old.
I am almost 30 so I am approaching this one as if it will be my last Olympic Games. I want to put out 110 percent to make sure that I am up at the top.
I want to be the king of sprints because I think I am.
I think about cars to try and distract myself. It's a good way to relax, take your mind off everything.
I know, I'm like a kid. Maybe I was a bit too spoilt growing up. Everything just came like I wanted it to.
I'm ready to win.
