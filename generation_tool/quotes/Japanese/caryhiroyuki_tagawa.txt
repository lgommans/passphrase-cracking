It's not whether you fall or make a mistake, it's what you do when you fall. And I say you stand up. You keep standing up. It's not how many times you fall, it's how many times you stand up.
Hollywood is my day job.
I believe the body can take care of itself. It's all about self-health. It's about depending on our breathing.
You release more toxins from the body through a deep exhale than you do from anything else.
Hollywood was a detour, although my mother was an aristocrat from Tokyo who ran away to join the theatre, so acting is in my genes.
My look is 'Poly'n'Asian' - part Polynesian native, part Asian warrior.
Nature is a big part of my weekend. Whenever possible, I take Friday and Monday off and spend four days outdoors. We should remind ourselves that there was something here before us, a force more powerful than us.
When you start working on a series, it's almost too much work. It's like a movie a week.
I originally started off as a healer before I came to Hollywood.
The one thing that about me, being a healer, I just have a different kind of relationship with people. So I am defiantly a different type of celebrity.
I really believe that breath, in and of itself... can become the ultimate self-healing tool.
The Hawaiian language needs to be studied globally as a language of life.
