Japanese,Actor
Sometimes I'm doing a big movie, or sometimes I'm doing a TV show, but as an actor, it's almost the same thing for me. If I'm doing action, or comedy, or something more heartfelt, it's a different approach, but it's all acting for me.
Action is just one of my skills.
If there is an action scene, I want to do everything myself.
It's hard for me to perform in English.
I was very comfortable on the set of 'Lost'. I was so nervous when I went on to the set because I had just watched all the 'Lost' episodes. I was, like, a fan. A big fan.
