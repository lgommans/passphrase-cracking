Japanese,Leader
Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not.
The strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience.
When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou have passed through. Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever.
Patience means restraining one's inclinations.
