Some people think I'm a total moron and I would hope most people think I'm very good at what I do.
Certainly the O.J. Simpson case was a turning point in my career.
I think that in the end, a talk show is a very different animal.
You can be a great reporter and not be such a great talk show host.
I think by laying it out for the viewer I'm avoiding the issue of bias.
They can say I have an opinion about something.
I'm not going to let people get away with either a dishonest or inaccurate premise to what we're talking about because I think that does the viewer a disturbance.
But doing what I do, you will never get unanimity of people.
I read our emails every day and I know there are people out there who think I'm awful.
Supreme Court arguments and decisions are fascinating to a few of us and really pretty boring to most.
