Latvian,Model
I like to think of myself as classy.
I was really into my studies and wanted to be a doctor.
I never forbid myself anything.
I love Rag & Bone, Dior, and Valentino; I like feminine, sexy things. Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, too.
I like Victoria Beckham - she has really good taste. Also, Natasha Poly, Miranda Kerr, and Alessandra Ambrosio. They know how to dress effortlessly sexy, but still cool.
I really want to work for myself and build a business from nowhere.
