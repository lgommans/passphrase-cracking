Lebanese,Politician
Justice is revenge.
It's very easy to have slogans and rhetoric that people will follow, but eventually the slogans fall away.
The main problem that we have in Lebanon, and in the region, is we don't have a real peace process and I think this is the main focal problem that we have in the region.
Nobody's going to give you everything on a silver tray. It's going to be difficult.
Although sometimes I might sound sometimes idealist or too optimistic but I think my father used to say to me in everything bad there's something good that is going to come out of it and there will always be a tomorrow.
I don't operate under threats. Full stop. I don't. I don't buckle to pressure.
Without justice you won't have stability.
Violence would be a huge gift to those who want a divided Lebanon.
I believe a relationship with a country is simply bound to the interests of two countries and not by personal issues.
I have popular support.
In Lebanon, it's never over for anyone. You cannot write off anyone or anything in this country.
