Australian,Model
I like to dress up but I'm not so concerned with looking very sexy, it's really more the art of dressing.
Fashion is quite inclusive and good at embracing different things and different forms of beauty. It's a very liberal industry. You can be yourself. Just not overweight.
My favourite author is Leon Trotsky - the political philosophy and the way he writes is beautiful, and really relevant, too.
I find myself to be quite sarcastic, and I wouldn't want to be with someone who didn't get that.
Love has no boundaries.
I know people want me to sort of defend myself, to sit here and be like, 'I'm a boy, but I wear make-up sometimes.' But, you know, to me, it doesn't really matter.
Most female models don't have any muscle mass.
I guess professionally I've left my gender open to artistic interpretation.
My whole life is controversy. What can I do? I'm like Britney Spears!
It just so happens that some of the things I like are feminine.
In this society, if a man is called a woman, that's the biggest insult he could get. Is that because women are considered something less?
I want to be the most eligible bachelor in New York City.
I love to work with people who are great at what they do.
I'm not a big fan of identity politics and sort of picking one thing and defining yourself with it.
When I'm sitting in a casting room in Paris, I'm not the thinnest model. Sometimes I'm not the most flat-chested, either.
As a kid, you get to the stage where you realise the gender barriers that exist in society and what you're supposed to do and not supposed to do.
I've been getting chatted up by men ever since I was 14.
