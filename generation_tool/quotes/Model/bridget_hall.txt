It's just me and my 6-month-old puppy. I am not dating anyone.
I don't remember ever having finished a book.
But, I understand that Black Comb and Whistler are supposed to be great for snowboarding. So I am looking forward to going there someday soon.
I am always looking for a cool tee shirt; maybe one with a rock band or an old advertisement.
I had to jump out of a plane! The shoot was for an editorial for a magazine; and it called for skydiving.
I love to find a great vintage secondhand shop.
My favorite teams are the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Jets.
Snowboarding! I love it! Some of the best places to snowboard are Telluride and Park Cities, Utah.
I am not a party girl.
Opening a family-style restaurant with comfort food like mac 'n' cheese, ribs and burgers has always been my dream.
Girls in my school were always prettier.
When I go out with my 16-year-old friends, I don't wear Chanel.
