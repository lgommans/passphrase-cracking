I feel like it's always important to curl your eyelashes. I always do when I wake up and you know you look tired, when you curl eyelashes and put mascara it makes such a huge difference, so that's the trick that I always use.
In any job, you have to give up certain things, and I believe that having a good quality of life means enjoying certain things only in moderation.
I am able to really enjoy the positive attention I receive.
I like to take care of myself and know what foods I should be eating.
I take really good care of my body.
