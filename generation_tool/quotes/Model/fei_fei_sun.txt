Wear some mascara, give attention to your eyebrows, and also take care of your lips.
I like Chanel mascara because it has the darkest black. For my eyebrows, I brush them through to keep them groomed and in place. And for my lips, I wear lip balm. I use Kiehl's Lip Balm #1. It's really helpful during fashion week. If I keep up with these three things, I feel like I look very fresh, young, and natural.
Suzhou is an ancient city full of old gardens that are very famous in China. It is very beautiful. Plus, I met my boyfriend there!
For clothes and accessories, I love my friend's boutique; One by One and UT.LAB for shoes.
I never pass up the chance to shop at vintage stores.
