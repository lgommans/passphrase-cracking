Model
I love everything special or unique. Sometimes I love girly clothes, sometimes I love strong boy looks. You never know what is the next look of Ming.
I want to be a big model. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I believe that will be one day I do it perfectly!
I love my black hair, but some imes I'd like to be blond, but I don't think it suits Asian girl... What a pity!
My personal style is kind of random; it's always changing - I'm a Pisces! Sometimes I like one particular style for a season, and the next season I will dress totally different.
I love to accentuate my eyes, so I'll wear eyeshadow and mascara.
I like to go to places where you can relax a little after you're done working.
