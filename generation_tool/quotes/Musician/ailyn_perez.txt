American,Musician
Sometimes the leads are equally balanced, like in 'Romeo and Juliet,' but sometimes they're just not.
The more you're out there singing, learning, and adding roles to your repertoire, it reforms the next piece.
From a young age, I was encouraged to sing, dance and learn folk and popular songs in Spanish.
I had teachers in high school to point me in the direction of the University of Indiana School of Music, and after IU, I went on to study at the Academy of Arts in Philadelphia. I graduated in 2006.
Music and opera are a big part of my life.
My family background is Mexican, and I was born in Chicago. It's pretty much family tradition every time we get together for Christmas and major holidays to sing. Our family time is centered around the food and a little bit of performing for one another.
