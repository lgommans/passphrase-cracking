Israeli,Musician
I had family and friends back home. Just because I could potentially feel alone in Los Angeles, that didn't mean I was alone.
I had a career at home, and I just knew that it'd be okay if nothing happened in Los Angeles.
If I could, I want to take a page from the George Clooney-like actors of the world. They do things that are relevant, things that don't necessarily have huge box office appeal, but they matter.
I always had a weird thing with being the last person somewhere... like a movie theater or a classroom. I get a weird sense of anxiety.
I'm not a real blond... Shocking.
My closest friends from Israel make fun of me for becoming an American, and my American friends make fun of how Israeli I am... I can't win.
