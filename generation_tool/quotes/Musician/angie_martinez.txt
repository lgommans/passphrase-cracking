After you date a player or two it's nice to just chill with a guy that can keep it basic.
We have to remember that no matter how much hardship we go through in our life, there is always going to be that fragile place in our heart.
Every weekend we've been trying to go out of town, to let people know about this album. I've been trying to host parties. It's hard, because it's a lot of work to do both.
I am going to do as much as I can do, because I hate to do anything and not give my all.
I had a lot of respect for Biggie, and it was just a weird, kinda difficult thing. When I'm doing touchy interviews like that, I just try to be fair to both parties.
I had no idea what to expect when we did Ladies' Night. I didn't think it was going to get nominated for a Grammy. I didn't know that we would have to perform on the MTV Awards show.
I love Jay personally and as an artist; I think he's incredible.
I might like somebody, and have to go interview somebody that hates them, but I still have to be fair.
I ran into Snoop one night. I was in the studio later, and I got this beat and thought he would sound great on it. I called him and he came right through that night.
I went to night school and summer school, I made that whole year up and I actually graduated on time. Also, I got a part-time job at the radio station.
Imagine the first time you are about to rap in a studio and you find yourself in a booth with Redman and KRS!
Nobody from my label called any of their labels to get this done. Most of it happened very naturally. Mary and I have been friends for a long time. Then Jay-Z offered.
The people I chose to work with me on this album are there because I have a personal relationship with them.
