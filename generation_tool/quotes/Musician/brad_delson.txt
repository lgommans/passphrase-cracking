People think when you get a record deal all your problems will go away. We know that the bigger we get, the more problems we'll have. I guess Puff Daddy was somewhat - what's the word? - prophetic in that respect.
I'm inspired by the sheer ingenuity and intelligence possessed by my fellow band mates.
The biggest misconception about us is that we're just a rock band. We think our music is a cross-section of many genres; a hybrid of what the six of us have grown up on.
Yeah, I always listen to both classic and newer folk-influenced music. Singer-songwriter, alternative music. I also listen to more experimental dance music.
I was a big Transformers fan.
In fact, I want to be a Transformer as an adult. I would transform into a Gulf Stream 500.

Each album has its own cycle. We wanted to capture all those feelings and moments for this touring cycle.
'Music for Relief' has played a vital role in helping get aid to people who most need it. We are deeply honored to participate in what will likely be our biggest event to date.
With so many amazing artists on one bill, we expect this concert to be incredibly powerful in its ability to raise both money and awareness for the long-term rebuilding effort we must all support.
We're resolving our differences and we're looking forward to putting out a record next year.
