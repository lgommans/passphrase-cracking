American,Musician
I didn't have time for talent shows and stuff like that. I was into books and studying real hard.
It wasn't until my last year of college, 1976, that I decided well, maybe he's right. Delbert had been pushing me since high school to put 100% into my music.
I was upset with Delbert, because there he was going again and pushing me out in front, without asking me.
