American,Musician
When I was growing up, I didn't know anything existed outside the borders of Buffalo.
I was a big fan of black gospel. As a kid, there were black groups I sang with from my teen years to my early 20s.
My last name is Wellsley, but a lot of people say it's Lowendowski, which is my mother's last name, and I had it changed to my father's when I was 18.
