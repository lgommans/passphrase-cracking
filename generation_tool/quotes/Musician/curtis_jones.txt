I try to give positive energy in all my shows.
I am a God.
I don't judge anybody because I've been the one to party and look for the after party to begin! I have more fun now both when I DJ and in general.
It's like James Brown used to say... I don't know, but whatever I play it's got to be funky.
What I'm making music for now is more similar to what I was doing in the beginning. In those days it was all about doing music so when people heard it in a club it would take their minds of their worries. I got more artistic but now I've gone back to basics.
I don't know why but it feels like home to me. The Scottish people are really friendly - you like to have fun and you don't care about anything, which is the same as I am.
