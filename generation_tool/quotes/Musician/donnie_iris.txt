I get a lot of inspiration from the audience feedback to our live shows.
I think getting the rest of the guys in the band to write is important.
I've always thought of myself as being extremely lucky. The idea is to keep that luck going. Headlining the Stanley was a real kick. I think it's the type of thing I could get used to.
