To me, the glass is always half full, never half empty.
It's very important to give back to the community and do anything you can.
I love L.A. for the beach and stuff, that's the reason I live here.
I still do a bit of this and a bit of that. Some brews and there's nothing wrong with a bud or two! I still do a bit of this and a bit of that. Some brews and there's nothing wrong with a bud or two!
I'm not trying to stay in the same place and I'm not trying to compete with what's currently in fashion. That would be dishonest. But, at the same time, I'm different and the music reflects that to some degree.
I've always loved the blues, John Lee Hooker, Janis Joplin, Hendrix.
You look at Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Bob Seger. All they ever wanted to do was go out there and entertain, and I'm the same way.
I'm younger than Rod Stewart and Bruce Springsteen, but I'm still getting up there in age.
