British,Musician
If you had a good radio - and everybody did in those days - you could find it.
Suckle was the first West Indian DJ and he had this fantastic source of music.
The BBC were not playing the music that was happening on the street so we did an independent production because we knew we had an audience. Then we licensed the album to EMI.
We were at Pye Studios for half an hour so we set the gear up and we did two tracks. A month later we found out it was selling thirty thousand copies a day.
I broke up the band in the office in Gerrard Street.
Some people think I'm a rock 'n' roll musician and some think I'm a jazz musician but, for me, there is no difference.
In my youth I thought I was going to be a professional rugby player.
My generation had the best years. We missed the Second World War and caught the outburst of rock 'n' roll.
I avoid the media circus, keep my head down and try to keep growing and learning things.
