American,Musician
Life is one long jubilee.
A song without music is a lot like H2 without the O.
One can be very happy without demanding that others agree with them.
Old age adds to the respect due to virtue, but it takes nothing from the contempt inspired by vice; it whitens only the hair.
Love is sweeping the country.
Deep, unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a regeneration, the initiation into a new state.
