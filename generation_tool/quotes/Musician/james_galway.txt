Irish,Musician
Never just run through a study because you happen to be familiar with it, but use it to see what you can get from it on this new day which has been granted you.
I do not consider my self as having mastered the flute, but I get a real kick out of trying.
Being unprepared heightens nerves.
Control of vibrato helps your musical expression.
The mind of the performer is a very strange thing.
Everyone who plays the flute should learn singing.
I have never received a flute from them for free and I would not accept such a gift from any manufacturer.
It is normal to be nervous.
You cannot prepare enough for anything.
I think it is most important for a teacher to play the pieces and studies that are being played by the student.
You can sightread better if you know your scales and arpeggios.
I do not see scales as abstract.
Scales played in the correct musical way are very exciting and rewarding.
Yes indeed I have gained a lot out of playing scales and etudes.
Running through things because you are familiar with them, breeds routine and this is the seed of boredom.
I have to report to those of you who think diamonds make a difference that I cannot tell what it is. Seriously, as you all know, they make no difference at all. They just make the flute look a little more special.
