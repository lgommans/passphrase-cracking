American,Musician
I love building a song up from nothing and jumping from one instrument to another.
I feel that recording a song already compromises the magical music one can create in the mind, so the fewer people watering down this process the better.
I can't say that I knocked on every door, but the few that I did didn't respond the way I wanted them to, so I think it was kind of disenchanting enough for me to go back to being subterranean.
