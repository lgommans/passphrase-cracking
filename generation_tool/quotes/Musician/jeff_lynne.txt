Old music is the same as new music - it's just a different way of delivering it.
At the end of the day I have to please myself. And I've made a record to please myself.
I just realized how long it was since the last album, and where did the time go? You know?
Music is my first love.
Yes, I love to play drums and bass and guitar and piano. Those are the main instruments I play. That is it.
I think from the age of thirteen, I really wanted to be a producer and I've always thought that the producer was the top of the tree.
As you get older, the days have gone, and the years have gone, and it's 'whoosh!'
I try to find nice chord changes, that's how I love to start, and then I start trying to knock it into a song, knock it into shape.
When you do a song new live on stage, it's kind of a bit weird until it gets worn in, you know, like oiled up a bit. It's still a little bit stiff until you really thrashed at it for a few weeks.
The hairs stand up on the back of my neck at certain music.
I'm still getting thrilled with music even after 40 years of doing it professionally.
To me, making records isn't work.
The first band I saw were Mike Sheridan and The Nightriders, in their brown mohair suits, in 1966.
It was so simple in the old days. You put out an album, people promoted it, it got in the charts, and you had a hit.
I don't actually like touring.
I just want to be in the studio. When you've got all the gear you want in your own house, it's difficult to go out and do something else, you know?
Live shows are fun - sometimes. But you have to practice for months on end.
