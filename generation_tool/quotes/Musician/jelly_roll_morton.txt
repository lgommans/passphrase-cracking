Jazz music is to be played sweet, soft, plenty rhythm.
I have been robbed of three million dollars all told. Everyone today is playing my stuff and I don't even get credit. Kansas City style, Chicago style, New Orleans style hell, they're all Jelly Roll style.
Get up from that piano. You hurtin' its feelings.
