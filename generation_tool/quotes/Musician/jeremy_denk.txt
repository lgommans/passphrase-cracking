American,Musician
I've learned a lot from being a chameleon, sort of adopting the musical personalities of who I was playing with.
I was a kid with a lot of different, strange interests - kind of crazy.
I'm one of those pianists who tends to ignore every existing recording and lots of traditions about playing pieces when I start.
It's long been my dream to have myself declared incompetent so I could just practice all day, and blog, and not have to take care of any normal life things.
Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to go to Oberlin and wanted the liberal arts. Obviously I really get intense pleasure out of drawing connections between pieces and poems and literature and ideas.
