If I stopped writing and being at my piano, I wouldn't know how to live. It's your best friend.
I see some some of these other guys, and they're wearing the hats and the jackets and saying the words and they're relating and they're picking. But there's something missing.
I'm having a good time watching Shooter. He's a good kid. He's been a good son to me. He has never failed.
I'd always been on the giving end of music and creating.
I'm very happy. I was little scared because it's such a big bite.
In our depths, I think we all feel very small in relation to the greater universe and God.
It's just what it is. It just all happened in my stride.
It's part of what I do at my piano - the hymns. And then I write.
Mother was a great force in her area of evangelism.
Music is important.
The fact that this is getting released, and people are just now hearing it, kind of tickles me. This is just awesome that the media is excited to talk to me and find out what's happening.
There's just no vision. You have no ground, no vision.
What I felt is the same kind of love I felt between Waylon and his audience. And that's what I miss.
