People like the idea of the trio and so I did mostly trio.
I always had the facial hair so I looked older than I was.
I heard Mr. Wild Bill Davis. I heard him play in 1930 and he told me that it would take me fifteen years just to learn the pedals, the pedals of the organ and I got mad.
Three months. I was playing the organ for three months. It was a challenge for me in the beginning.
And then when I found my sound, it took me two and a half weeks to find my sound and when I did I pulled out all the stops, all the stops I could find.
My first recording, a guy came down to Philadelphia and heard me play and he introduced me to Alfred Lion.
I did my first recording. It was called The Champ.
Ninety-five percent of my audience was white.
All the colleges I played, most of the colleges, they were white.
I just came from Aspen, Colorado and they had fifteen kids I played for and they all played horns.
I played with Sam Lay, Jimmy Reed, Big Walter Horton, Big Moose Walker, and all those guys.
Yeah, you know everybody has somebody that they patterned themselves after.
My mom would have liked it that I patterned myself more after Jimmy Reed.
I played with Eddie Taylor's son, Tim Taylor and Carey Bells son Lurie Bell.
Michael Coleman, now that was a boy that taught me some stuff too.
My boys told me they'd rather play than practice.
