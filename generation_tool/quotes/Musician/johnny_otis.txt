American,Musician
Genetically, I'm pure Greek. Psychologically, environmentally, culturally, by choice, I'm a member of the black community.
Society wants to categorize everything, but to me it's all African-American music.
I get a wave of pride in America when I look back at what we've accomplished in the field of music.
People are going to wake up to this great reservoir of music we've created in America - cakewalks, one-steps, boogie-woogie, country and western. I had a bit to do with one of those traditions.
I'm not suggesting our music is the only music, but I am suggesting that there are certain elements in America's culture that are so precious that it would be a shame for them to go down the drain.
When I got near teen age, I was so happy with my friends and the African-American culture that I couldn't imagine not being part of it.
