Musician
It's a complicated relationship with a guitar. I love the Bullet, for sure.
I am the extreme member of the band because I never go out after the show. It's my rule.
To me, the idea of living this lifestyle is so boring that I would prefer to read Marcel Proust the whole time during a tour.
I always considered technical musicianship as something you should be ashamed of - I don't know why.
It's a great honor when somebody takes your song and does something different with it. That's what music is all about: to constantly change what somebody else has done.
My heroes, I couldn't imagine them practicing. Like Bob Dylan, you know? Bob Dylan's a very, very good guitar player, but it's like he's trying to hide it. I always loved this attitude. When you're very good... it's like being an athlete - and I always hated sports!
I thought it was too 'glam rock' to practice. The problem is that now I'm a pretty bad guitar player.
The bands you like and know that are French are always outsiders in the French music industry - Daft Punk, Air.
When people say 'stadium songs,' it's really negative. All the festival headliners, I've realised, are usually the worst bands.
