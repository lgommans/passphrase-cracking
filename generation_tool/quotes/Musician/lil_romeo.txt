American,Musician
I love college life.
My dad and my uncles used to always be in the studio at my house.
We would make songs, and the producers said we should play it for my dad. I was kind of scared, I didn't know what to think cuz we were just joking around.
Dreams can come true.
Family always gonna be there.
I always have to bring back an all-A report card.
Don't change for nobody.
I have a lot of gadgets, remote controls for everything - the curtains, pool cover - it's like The Jetsons!
I run in the morning, lift weights in the afternoon, basketball training at night, and then lift weights again at night.
I don't bring anything expensive to the dorms.
I love romantic comedies.
