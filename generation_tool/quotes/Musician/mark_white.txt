Musician
I was exposed to jazz early on.
After a couple years of occasional lessons with Pass I moved to Boston to attend the New England Conservatory.
I agree totally with Metheny regarding the sound influencing the way you play.
Tone on jazz guitars is a real tough issue.
The combination of experience and experimentation will ultimately yield a personal sound.
Still others want a traditional guitar sound if they call you for guitar.
