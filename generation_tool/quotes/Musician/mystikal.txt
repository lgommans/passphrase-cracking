In New Orleans, bounce music was prevalent. That was all they wanted to hear. It was new and trendy, and it was hot, and it was taking off. Artists were coming out of everywhere. They did some great songs, some really catchy, fun songs. That was just the feel of New Orleans music.
Every body and thing has politics involved. Every. Single. Thing.
All you have to do is put me in front of the people and put the beat in front of me, and the rest is history.
I have to be able to be the artist that I am.
I just want to make sure to always tell my fans thank you for the support.
I'm writing songs to perform, to entertain. And when I'm really trying to get inspired, I go backwards, and I just rap.
I try to set trends.
I'm in control of the positions that I allow myself to be in.
Respect your success.
All I gotta do is my job, do what it is that I bring to the table - that fire - and put the thump on these songs, and everything's gonna work from there.
My girlfriend is rap. Music and albums and records and my kids.
The best bounce rapper ain't gonna be able to compete with Jay-Z, not on a major scale.
Dark can't exist with the light. Ain't nothing dark about God.
I guess I reinvented myself about 18 times throughout my career.
I come from an era of music when it had heart and soul.
Lil Wayne'll make you wanna jump up, get three jobs, write a song, and do a movie!
Six years is a long time. To leave the fans with their hands in the air and to come back six years later, and the people still have their hands in the air, that's nothing but God. I'm standing in a position that's so humbling.
It's the least I can do, to come back with some strong music.
I did my thing with Jive. I was a national recording artist, but I had run into a wall.
