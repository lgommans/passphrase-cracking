English,Musician
I am still working with music, but Gordon and I no longer perform together.
I have very much enjoyed being in the music business in different roles through five different decades.
Paul and I don't see that much of each other these days, but I certainly still regard him as a friend.
Shows were very different then - even as the headliner we did a very short set by today's standards and sound systems were really primitive. But the girls made it all worthwhile!
The best music of any era lasts well, I think.
Well, for the reasons I mention above, although I am not sure the live shows were really so brilliant - but nobody could hear much so perhaps it did not matter! It was certainly a very exciting time for us all.
Well, in the sense that we do not tour or record together anymore - then I suppose not. But if our old recordings get heard more we shall be delighted.
Sometimes people's careers take off on their first albums, sometimes they don't.
In any business, the more you learn, the more sympathetic you can be to other people's positions.
