English,Musician
I'm sorry I can't speak very coherently.
I don't think I'm easy to talk about. I've got a very irregular head. And I'm not anything that you think I am anyway.
I do tend to take lines from other lines I like, and then write around them.
I'm full of dust and guitars.
I'm treading the backward path. Mostly, I just waste my time.
I don't really read a lot. Maybe I should.
I'd like to be rich. I'd like a lot of money to put into my physicals and to buy food for all my friends.
When we parted I had written everything for the group. My leaving sort of evened things out within the group.
I think young people should have a lot of fun. But I never seem to have any.
I think it's good if a song has more than one meaning. Maybe that kind of song can reach far more people.
I wasn't always this introverted.
Fairy-tales are nice.
I'm disappearing, avoiding most things.
A lot of people want to make films and do photography and things, but I'm quite happy doing what I'm doing.
Have you seen the roses? There's a whole lot of colours.
Getting used to the studio and everything was fun, we freaked about alot. I was working very hard then.
I like songs that are simple.
I never felt so close to a guitar as that silver one with mirrors that I used on stage all the time.
I've just had an operation, but nothing too serious.
If I'd stayed at college I would have become a teacher.
It's always been too slow for me. Playing. The pace of things. I'm a fast sprinter. The trouble was, after playing in the group for a few months, I couldn't reach that point.
Living in Cambridge, with nature and everything, it's so clean.
The only work I've done the last two years is interviews. I'm very good at it.
