The best thing to do is stare it in the face and move on. We have to face our fears and plow through. I think taking chances takes a lot more courage than staying stagnant and doing what's safe and comfortable.
When someone has cancer, the whole family and everyone who loves them does, too.
Artists who write songs... what they're going through usually comes through in their music.
I think I've grown a lot in the last few years, and I needed to express myself as an artist on this. It wasn't necessarily about going in and making an album chocked full of hit singles... there were a lot of things I did out of the joy and the want to do it.
That's a song about reaching deep inside yourself where you can completely be who you are.
It's nice to be able to engage with this fan base that I've worked to build, brick by brick.
I'm not ready to retire, and I think I have some of the best music of my life coming up.
I want to keep people engaged and I want them to feel connected to what I'm doing.
