I always put dance stuff out because you have to work, man. You have to eat. You have to compromise sometimes to make it. I had to make sacrifices, and I had to raise my children.
Sometimes people don't like me because I'm too honest; I speak the truth.
It's not really a curse or anything that you're blind; it's really a blessing.
If I'm talking to you, I can't see you, but I can see inside of you and what you're thinking. That's a mixed blessing.
I was involved with the Nation of Islam. I wasn't doing no marching. I've been involved with the Nation for 50 years. Back in those days, they tried to label us as black Muslims. There are Muslims all over the world. It doesn't have to be black; it doesn't matter what color he is.
