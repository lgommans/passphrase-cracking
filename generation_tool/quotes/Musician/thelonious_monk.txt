All musicians are subconsciously mathematicians.
I never though much about race.
Everybody in all countries tries to play jazz.
I don't know what other people are doing - I just know about me.
We have two kids, my wife and myself.
I'd go stupid collecting and counting my money.
I guess, you know, if I didn't make it with the piano, I guess I would've been the biggest bum.
I can shoot pool, and I can play ping-pong. I'm pretty good at those games.
Be-bop wasn't developed in any deliberate way.
