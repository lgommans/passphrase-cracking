American,Musician
I think I sound like a fella who's always making a plea through his music. Sort of a plea of sincerity.
I don't sing to people. I sing for them. I told that once to Elvis Presley. He bought it. After that Elvis sang not to but for the audience. A subtle difference.
I want people to feel good after I sing.
