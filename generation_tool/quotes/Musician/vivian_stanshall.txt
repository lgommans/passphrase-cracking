I'm not different for the sake of being different, only for the desperate sake of being myself. I can't join your gang: you'd think I was a phony and I'd know it.

If I had all the money I'd spent on drink, I'd spend it on drink.
Do you know what a Palmist once said to me? She said: will you let go!
