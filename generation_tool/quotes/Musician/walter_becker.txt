American,Musician
I'm a self-taught musician aside from what I've been able to pick up from other players.
I listen to a mixture of old jazz, contemporary, pop, some world beat stuff and various odds and ends.
My primary influences were the best jazz players from the 50's and 60's and later some of the pop people from the same time period along with the better of the well known blues musicians.
