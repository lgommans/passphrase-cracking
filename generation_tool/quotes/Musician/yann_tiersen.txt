French,Musician
I want less and less control with music. Just playing music without any idea of composition or writing.
I started making music with my band in the '80s, so I am more product of post punk than classical music, and I have always carried on this way.
In France the music schools are a bit old fashioned. I was more excited about doing my own stuff or to play with my friend in my band, than studying the piano.
I can't imagine playing a boring gig. Like, a boring audience without reaction, I will play against them.
When I'm working in the studio, I like to be on my own because I don't know where I'm going; I want to be completely free to spend lots of time on songs.
Most of the time I like to start an album abroad, not at home, just to avoid the pressure, to not wake up and think, 'OK, it's the first of recording this album.' I like to avoid that.
I love working and writing new songs. But sometimes you need to wait, to have something in your mind, and then you can let yourself play music.
I don't compose, actually. I just record. I'm the opposite of a composer in my way of working. I'm more instinctive.
