New Zealander,Actor
I hope I'm going to act for the rest of my life. What scares me is that if I get a big head, my mum said she would take me out of the business instantly - and if you knew my mum, she would do it!
I feel like I'm more of a physical actor than a voice actor.
I love doing the conventions and being an ambassador for 'Star Wars.'
I love being an ambassador for 'Star Wars.'
I had never really done voice-over. If you've ever seen me, I'm more the communicator through body language and movement... I'm a physical actor.
I haven't given up on acting, but I've gone away from it for a while to concentrate on myself and the fans of 'Star Wars.'
