New Zealander,Scientist
If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.
You should never bet against anything in science at odds of more than about 1012 to 1.
Of all created comforts, God is the lender; you are the borrower, not the owner.
All science is either physics or stamp collecting.
