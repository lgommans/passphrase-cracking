It is wrong to use equal language for unequal actions.
The Bible says that two cannot walk together unless they are agreed.
We have been filled with grief as we have witnessed the decline of the North American Church that was once filled with missionary zeal and yet now seems determined to bury itself in a deadly embrace with the spirit of the age.
We will not, on the altar of money, mortgage our conscience, mortgage our faith, mortgage our salvation.
We are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once.
We are insisting and we will continue to insist that this faith of the church must continue to be upheld come rain, come fire. That is our position.
