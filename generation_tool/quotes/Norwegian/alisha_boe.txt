I was depressed a lot as a kid, and I was really sad and wouldn't be able to get out of bed.
Audiences need to keep demanding shows with strong female leads.
I read '13 Reasons Why' in middle school, and the message of the book stuck with me: to treat people better because you never know what they're going through.
Everyone on 'Ray Donovan' was super nice. I was kind of surprised by how welcoming everyone was because of how established the show was.
I have noticed a growth in demand from audiences to include more women of colour and women to be cast as significant roles in TV shows and movies.
I'm so honoured and excited to be working in the business at a time when it's truly progressing.
I didn't really have the most healthy of upbringings.
