Norwegian,Actress
I wasn't even going to do acting. I don't know how it even happened, to be honest. I was going to go into psychology or something like that. Or business. And then some moment of madness took over and I decided, 'Oh, I'm gonna go to London and try to be an actor.'
I love leather. I'm very much a leather jacket, leather trousers kind of girl.
