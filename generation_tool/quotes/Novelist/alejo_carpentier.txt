Cuban,Novelist
I studied harmony and composition in a very spontaneous manner.
I gladly accepted the commission but was uncertain about what the end result would be. On the one hand, Cuban music was conquering the world; being heard everywhere, and our small island was already producing one of the popular musical genres of the 20th century.

The concept of the marvelous begins to take form when it arises from an unexpected alteration of reality, the miracle.
From the beginning, the sensation of the marvelous presupposes faith.
I had breathed in the atmosphere created by Henri Christophe, the monarch of incredible aims, much more surprising than all the kings invented by the surrealists.
