English,Novelist
Sow an act and you reap a habit. Sow a habit and you reap a character. Sow a character and you reap a destiny.
Not a day passes over the earth, but men and women of no note do great deeds, speak great words and suffer noble sorrows.
The joys we expect are not so bright, nor the troubles so dark as we fancy they will be.
Make 'em laugh; make 'em cry; make 'em wait.
The absent are like children, helpless to defend themselves.
Judicious absence is a weapon.
