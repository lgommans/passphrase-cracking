English,Novelist
Don't just count your years, make your years count.
Memoirs are the backstairs of history.
A witty woman is a treasure; a witty beauty is a power.
Who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is answered.
A human act once set in motion flows on forever to the great account. Our deathlessness is in what we do, not in what we are.
Jealousy is love bed of burning snarl.
Always imitate the behavior of the winners when you lose.
I expect Woman will be the last thing civilized by Man.
She poured a little social sewage into his ears.
Caricature is rough truth.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life!
Cynicism is intellectual dandyism.
Possession without obligation to the object possessed approaches felicity.
The well of true wit is truth itself.
Speech is the small change of silence.
Kissing don't last: cookery do!
Bring the army of the faithful through.
The man of science is nothing if not a poet gone wrong.
The most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination.
I expect that Woman will be the last thing civilized by Man.
There is nothing the body suffers the soul may not profit by.
The man or country that fights priestcraft and priests is to my mind striking deeper for freedom than can be struck anywhere.
