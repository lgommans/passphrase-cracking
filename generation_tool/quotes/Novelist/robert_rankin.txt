Yes, I have over the years done a lot of the audio books, which are just plain reading.
When you write, you hear the characters speaking to you as you take dictation from what they say. And obviously, they had particular personalities when you hear them.
I always had a problem when I did the audio books myself because they weren't made to have me doing all the voices. And to hear established actors, and you think, 'Wow, that sounds like it's supposed to sound,' is great. They've got the right inflections, which is an enormous skill.
Too afraid of plagiarising someone, so I stopped reading fiction in 1981.
