Pakistani,Politician
I can't let my mother's death have been in vain. Democracy is the best revenge, and we will have it.
I would like to help my people in any way I can. It's difficult times in Pakistan and we all have to help.
I grew up overnight on that day, Dec. 27, 2007.
I am confident Pakistani government will provide me with adequate security, unlike the government at the time that sabotaged my mother's security in Pakistan.
I am chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.
