Philosopher
Play so that you may be serious.
Written laws are like spiders' webs, and will, like them, only entangle and hold the poor and weak, while the rich and powerful will easily break through them.
The first draught serveth for health, the second for pleasure, the third for shame, and the fourth for madness.
Wise men argue causes; fools decide them.
Every man is his own chief enemy.
