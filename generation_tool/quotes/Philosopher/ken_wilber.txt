American,Philosopher
I rise to taste the dawn, and find that love alone will shine today.
Most of us, I suspect, prefer our teachers to be of the Nice Guy variety.
What is it in you that brings you to a spiritual teacher in the first place? It's not the spirit in you, since that is already enlightened, and has no need to seek. No, it is the ego in you that brings you to a teacher.
The Enlightenment was an attempt to liberate myth and base truth claims on evidence, not just dogma. But when science threw out the church, they threw out the baby with the bath water.
I think I was a born scientist.
I went to Duke University in the medical track. And then I decided I wanted to do something more creative, so I switched to biochemistry at Nebraska.
I don't talk about consciousness. I talk about interiority.
What's my philosophy? In a word, integral.
