Philosopher
Life may be not only meaningless but absurd.
Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable.
There is a tendency to seek an objective account of everything before admitting its reality.
Eventually, I believe, current attempts to understand the mind by analogy with man-made computers that can perform superbly some of the same external tasks as conscious beings will be recognized as a gigantic waste of time.
