American,Photographer
My work reflects a relationship to the built world that shifts between control and randomness, strangeness and beauty, comfort and fear.
I usually have one project I'm focusing on but often have many other projects in the back of my mind for several years.
I would often see windows that looked to me like they weren't real - almost like a painting on a wall instead of a window. I thought it was kind of a cool idea.
I know from experience it's very hard to get access to a prison to take pictures.
As a photographer, I'm interested in how dramatically photography has changed. Most images are not real or are composites, and most of us don't even know it anymore.
