American,Photographer
I wish more people felt that photography was an adventure the same as life itself and felt that their individual feelings were worth expressing. To me, that makes photography more exciting.
Experience is the best teacher of all. And for that, there are no guarantees that one will become an artist. Only the journey matters.
