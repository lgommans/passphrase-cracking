French,Photographer
Photography to me is catching a moment which is passing, and which is true.
I take photographs with love, so I try to make them art objects. But I make them for myself first and foremost - that is important.
It's marvellous, marvellous! Nothing will ever be as much fun. I'm going to photograph everything, everything!
