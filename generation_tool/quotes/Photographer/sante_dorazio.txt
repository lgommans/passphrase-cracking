American,Photographer
I was always taught to let the obstacles be your guide because they lead you to places that you wouldn't have gone on your own. Instead of going through a rock, you go around it, creating a path.
I had been, to the age of 25, a bookworm.
I try to find the picture, not create it.
If I create anything, I create the atmosphere of trust and openness.
I'm trained to look for certain things... I shoot, I shoot, I shoot, and then I go find it in the ether.
I made most of my living doing beauty, because I was never really the fashion person.
Over the years I always did some water colors, and I did a series of pictures of drawings. I always did it during a period of time that was slow in the photo business, but in essence it was always frustrating because I'd get started, and then it would be time to get back to work and I wouldn't get anywhere with the painting.
My process of working is that I don't create a picture, I find it.
I was in Milan, and somebody gave me a Trussardi diary, and I thought 'Genius.' Inside I put the Polaroids, how much film I shot, who I shot with. This way, for billing later on, I had all the information.
