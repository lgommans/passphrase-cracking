Harmony is pure love, for love is complete agreement.
There is no greater glory than love, nor any greater punishment than jealousy.
With a few flowers in my garden, half a dozen pictures and some books, I live without envy.
Dreaming of a tomorrow, which tomorrow, will be as distant then as 'tis today.
Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins.
