'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
By blood a king, in heart a clown.
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering, 'It will be happier.'
No man ever got very high by pulling other people down. The intelligent merchant does not knock his competitors. The sensible worker does not knock those who work with him. Don't knock your friends. Don't knock your enemies. Don't knock yourself.
Ours not to reason why, ours but to do and die.
I must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair.
Sin is too stupid to see beyond itself.
Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?
Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control; these three alone lead one to sovereign power.
A lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies.
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.
Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Words, like nature, half reveal and half conceal the soul within.
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time.
Who is wise in love, love most, say least.
There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.
What rights are those that dare not resist for them?
A sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier times.
Theirs is not to make reply: Theirs is not to reason why: Theirs is but to do and die.
All experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move.
The happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Love is the only gold.
Authority forgets a dying king.
My strength is as the strength of ten, because my heart is pure.
