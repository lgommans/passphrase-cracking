American,Poet
Is there something we have forgotten? Some precious thing we have lost, wandering in strange lands?
Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept and tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky.
Yet would we die as some have done, beating a way for the rising sun.
How dare anyone, parent, schoolteacher, or merely literary critic, tell me not to act colored.
