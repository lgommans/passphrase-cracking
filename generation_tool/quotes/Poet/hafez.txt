Poet
Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you.
Don't be surprised at Fortune's turns and twists: That wheel has spun a thousand yarns before.
Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, 'You owe me.' Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky.
Send a bouquet of your face with the morning breeze.
Oh Cup-bearer, set my glass afire with the light of wine!
I have learned so much from God that I can no longer call myself a Christian, a Hindu, a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Jew.
