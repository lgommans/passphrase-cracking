Greek,Poet
A sympathetic friend can be quite as dear as a brother.
Words empty as the wind are best left unsaid.
There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.
There is a time for many words, and there is also a time for sleep.
Wise to resolve, and patient to perform.
The charity that is a trifle to us can be precious to others.
Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for other's good, and melt at other's woe.
The difficulty is not so great to die for a friend, as to find a friend worth dying for.
Two urns on Jove's high throne have ever stood, the source of evil one, and one of good; from thence the cup of mortal man he fills, blessings to these, to those distributes ills; to most he mingles both.
In youth and beauty, wisdom is but rare!
A decent boldness ever meets with friends.
For rarely are sons similar to their fathers: most are worse, and a few are better than their fathers.
Light is the task where many share the toil.
Hateful to me as are the gates of hell, Is he who, hiding one thing in his heart, Utters another.
Be still my heart; thou hast known worse than this.
How vain, without the merit, is the name.
And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared.
Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.
True friends appear less moved than counterfeit.
To have a great man for an intimate friend seems pleasant to those who have never tried it; those who have, fear it.
Hunger is insolent, and will be fed.
Without a sign, his sword the brave man draws, and asks no omen, but his country's cause.
It is not good to have a rule of many.
Even were sleep is concerned, too much is a bad thing.
Nothing shall I, while sane, compare with a friend.
Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.
