Turkish,Poet
Living is no laughing matter: you must live with great seriousness like a squirrel for example - I mean without looking for something beyond and above living, I mean living must be your whole occupation.
However and wherever we are, we must live as if we will never die.
And don't forget, a prisoner's wife must always think good thoughts.
