French,Poet
The world is full of fools; and he who would not wish to see one, must not only shut himself up alone, but must also break his looking-glass.
The dreadful burden of having nothing to do.
However big the fool, there is always a bigger fool to admire him.
No one who cannot limit himself has ever been able to write.
