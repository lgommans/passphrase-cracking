Polish,Poet
Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art.
You can close your eyes to reality but not to memories.
The window to the world can be covered by a newspaper.
The weakest link in a chain is the strongest because it can break it.
No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.
Is it progress if a cannibal uses a fork?
When you jump for joy, beware that no one moves the ground from beneath your feet.
When smashing monuments, save the pedestals - they always come in handy.
You must first have a lot of patience to learn to have patience.
Mankind deserves sacrifice - but not of mankind.
In a war of ideas it is people who get killed.
Thoughts, like fleas, jump from man to man, but they don't bite everybody.
Whenever man begins to doubt himself, he does something so stupid that he is reassured.
Don't trust the heart, it wants your blood.
Telling lies does not work in advertising.
The first requisite for immortality is death.
Never lie when the truth is more profitable.
People find life entirely too time-consuming.
Sometimes something worth doing is worth overdoing.
The pleasure of reading is doubled when one lives with another who shares the same books.
First of all, I choose the great roles, and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don't come, I choose the ones that pay the rent.
Value your words. Each one may be the last.
