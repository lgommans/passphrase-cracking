Polish,Musician
I don't think I handle the notes much differently from other pianists. But the pauses between the notes - ah, there is where the artistry lies!!
I know two kinds of audiences only - one coughing, and one not coughing.
I am the only person here who is enjoying this, and I get the money; they pay and have to suffer.
The notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the notes ah, that is where the art resides.
When a piece gets difficult, make faces.
