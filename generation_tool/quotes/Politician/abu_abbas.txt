Palestinian,Politician
It is true that a large percentage of the Western world hopes that I am imprisoned or dead. But all my people, the Palestinians and the Arabs, wish me long life and freedom.
We never had planned to hijack a ship. We never thought of any war plans outside the Palestinian lands. We wished that the program had not failed and then the warriors could have achieved their goals.
I do not feel remorse. Everybody makes mistakes in war.
When America is chasing you, the whole world is chasing you.
The purpose of armed struggle is not simply to kill... its purpose is to reach a political goal.
