English,Politician
There are no true friends in politics. We are all sharks circling, and waiting, for traces of blood to appear in the water.
There's nothing so improves the mood of the Party as the imminent execution of a senior colleague.
In the end we are all sacked and it's always awful. It is as inevitable as death following life. If you are elevated there comes a day when you are demoted. Even Prime Ministers.
They're just actors. I much prefer the real thing!
The more you know about a species, the more you understand about how better to help protect them.
