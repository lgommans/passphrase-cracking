Irish,Politician
I call on everyone of goodwill both in Ireland and abroad to join now in ensuring that the beginning of peace becomes a reality, before this year is out. Let us together open a new era in our history.
I am convinced that nobody should be afraid of peace.
What Ireland needs now above all else is peace.
