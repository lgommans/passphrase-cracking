American,Politician
I was planning to be a baseball player until I ran into something called a curveball. And that set me back.
When I finished my term, I thought about running for governor then but decided not to because, frankly, I didn't think I was ready. I wasn't comfortable that I was prepared to do the job.
As attorney general, I've had some connection with just about every important public issue in the last eight years in Kentucky. All of the important public issues of the day have, at some point.
As attorney general, I can either look into it or I can ignore it because they're a bunch of powerful legislators... and I'm afraid they're going to cut my budget.
I have the happy circumstance of either being accused of political grandstanding on the one hand or cover-ups on the other.
