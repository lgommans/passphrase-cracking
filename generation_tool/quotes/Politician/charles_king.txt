I think in church you're raised like God is God and you are here.
We influence singing but never really songwriting.
The gift of song is just like... I think music is one of those true things in this world that is universal.
You know when I really realized like 'wow' what a gift this is was when I sang at camp and a girl wrote me a letter and said the song that I sung kept her from committing suicide.
I always sang in church always was in a gospel choir and directed choirs and always performed, but I never thought of it as a powerful thing.
I have grown in my writing and I care about it now and I know how important it is to write stuff.
I think there are some songwriters who are just brilliant who can write and then I think there are some songwriters who can like me I have a problem writing chorus lyrics but I can write a song in a story like that.
I know at my church a lot of the times we sung from hymn books and as we got older we started to change with time. I can honestly say that I was never influenced to write for the church.
You can fill this table up with people who are racist, homophobic, Satanist worshippers, sexist and we can be arguing but if you put on a song, I guarantee that people will stop and listen and that's what I love about music, it can bring people together.
