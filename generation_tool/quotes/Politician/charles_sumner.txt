American,Politician
From the beginning of our history the country has been afflicted with compromise. It is by compromise that human rights have been abandoned.
The true grandeur of humanity is in moral elevation, sustained, enlightened and decorated by the intellect of man.
The age of chivalry has gone; the age of humanity has come.
I have never known a man who was sensual in his youth, who was high-minded when old.
No true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind.
