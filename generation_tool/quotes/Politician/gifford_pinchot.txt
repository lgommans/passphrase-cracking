World-wide practice of Conservation and the fair and continued access by all nations to the resources they need are the two indispensable foundations of continuous plenty and of permanent peace.
Unless we practice conservation, those who come after us will have to pay the price of misery, degradation, and failure for the progress and prosperity of our day.
Conservation means the wise use of the earth and its resources for the lasting good of men.
The vast possibilities of our great future will become realities only if we make ourselves responsible for that future.
Innovations never happen as planned.
The earth and its resources belong of right to its people.
The outgrowth of conservation, the inevitable result, is national efficiency.
