Danish,Politician
We can say farewell to 10 years of bourgeois rule... now we have the opportunity to change Denmark.
For young girls, whom I meet a lot when I travel around the country, it will be a big thing. It will really show them that there's no post in Denmark that a girl can't aspire to.
People want to make sacrifices but they don't want to be sacrificed.
This is not an election where we hand out gifts. It is an election where we ask everyone to contribute more.
We have the opportunity to change Denmark - that opportunity must be seized.
Without growth we can't pay down our debt, and without growth there's no money for welfare.
We are not jumping on the austerity bandwagon. A healthy economy is by far the most important thing for Social Democrats.
Of course we have to address the deficit if we win.
I feel like giving myself a pat on the back. We can create history tonight. We can bid goodbye to 10 years of (Liberal-Conservative) government which has ground to a halt, and get a new government and a new majority in Denmark.
Denmark needs change, Denmark needs to move on and Denmark needs my leadership.
We did it. Make no mistake: We have written history. Today there's a change of guards in Denmark.
I'm taking care of the children, doing a bit of cooking and trying to do a bit of DIY around the house. But that's not going too well.
I know too much about British politics to comment on British politics.
I really appreciate the British part of my family.
But what sets Europe apart is we insist on a social model that consists of solidarity, equal opportunity and a certain amount of redistribution.
So yes, European decision making is not pretty. But it does work.
