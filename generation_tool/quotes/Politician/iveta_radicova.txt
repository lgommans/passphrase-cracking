Politician
From my point of view it's impossible to cut debt in a country with new debt from another country.
If we have a common currency, the main regulator for policy in the country is the fiscal policy.
We need first of all the reform of our justice system. We need reform of the education system, because of quality of education because of innovation and technology. And we need administrative reform. Too much bureaucracy.
It is the entire euro zone system which is under threat at the moment, not just a few small countries anymore... Our euro is under threat. The changing situation needs a quick and immediate reaction.
If another euro country fails, so does Slovakia. Our economy is 80% open and if the citizens of Spain and Portugal have no money to buy cars made here in Slovakia then that will be bad for us. Everything is connected.
In some countries we have had the right to vote for less than 100 years, so the entry of women into political leadership has caused a tsunami.
