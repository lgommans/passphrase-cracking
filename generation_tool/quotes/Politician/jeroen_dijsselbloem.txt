If I finance a bank and I know if the bank will get in trouble, I will be hit and I will lose money, I will put a price on that.
If there is a risk in a bank, our first question should be 'Okay, what are you in the bank going to do about that? What can you do to recapitalise yourself?'. If the bank can't do it, then we'll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in recapitalising the bank, and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders.
Banks should contribute to the real economy, make a positive contribution to economic growth.
Taking away the risk from the financial sector and taking it on to the public shoulders is not the right approach.
Macroeconomic adjustment programmes are tailor-made to the situation of the country concerned and no models or templates are used.
If we are going to approach the euro area as a zone with a harsh line in the middle between AAA and non-AAA, between the north and the south, no way are we going to move forward.
As a minister, you shouldn't imagine you know better than the technical experts in your ministry. In the end you're there to apply the political stamp of approval.
