American,Politician
I am pleased with the direction we are moving in.
I don't think anyone should pick a candidate for any office based solely on gender. That would be, I believe, a mistake.
The budget is tight, and that is exactly where we want it to be and where we need it to be.
The reform of government needs to continue.
This unchecked spending is growing faster than our economy, faster than inflation, and far beyond our means to sustain it.
Certainly accountability of government is what people are clamoring for; they want to know that when lawmakers make a promise or a proposal, you can actually accomplish it.
There's a fine line in being too specific so you can't be too flexible, and being too vague in being specific and people not thinking it's meaningful.
Near-term deficits are temporary and manageable if - and only if - we keep spending in check, the tax burden low and the economy growing.
