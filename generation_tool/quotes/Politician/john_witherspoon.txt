American,Politician
Never rise to speak till you have something to say; and when you have said it, cease.
Never read a book through merely because you have begun it.
Those who wish well to the State ought to choose to places of trust men of inward principle, justified by exemplary conversation.
The people in general ought to have regard to the moral character of those whom they invest with authority either in the legislative, executive, or judicial branches.
