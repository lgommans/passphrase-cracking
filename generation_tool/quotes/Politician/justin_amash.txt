American,Politician
I follow a set of principles, I follow the Constitution. And that's what I base my votes on. Limited government, economic freedom and individual liberty.
As a legislator, I saw how effective I could be by being transparent, posting and explaining all of my votes.
If you're going to vote yes and change the law. You have to know what's in it. You can't depend on other people.
I haven't been in politics too long so that's a good thing.
Those of us who are pro-life should demand more from Congress.
In the state of Michigan, where I served in the state Legislature, there was a lot of shuffling of money between one year and the other to balance the budget.
Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional.
I don't have a particular go-to political blog.
Everyone knows about the substantive issues of concern, like federal health care, but very little is said about the process, the lack of accountability.
