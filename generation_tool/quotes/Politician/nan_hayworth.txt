American,Politician
We're facing a natural disaster in the middle of an economic disaster. The federal government has to balance its budget the way our families do.
Jay Townsend has offered, and I have accepted, his resignation from his position with my campaign. Now let's return to talking about issues that really matter to families: job creation, spending restraint and economic development.
If we can return to a government that the Founders, in their wisdom, envisioned for us, we can return to a government that will allow our economy to thrive again, and our people to live in liberty.
We need to do things better, but in a way that makes sense.
The government would be making decisions about what type of care is given, what procedures can be performed, and the kind of medications prescribed. It would be a very profound change from the ideal to which we aspire.
Doctors cannot afford to provide care at the rate of reimbursement that Medicare insists that they accept.
We have to honor our commitments to today's beneficiaries, but we can't solve the growing deficit and debt problems unless we are smart, courageous, and sensible in planning for future.
Right now, there are nearly 30 jobs bills passed by the House with support from both Republicans and Democrats that are awaiting action in the Democratic-run Senate.
We are hopeful that President Obama, in his State of the Union Address, will express a willingness to work with Republicans to enact all of these jobs bills.
We were elected in a wave because the people in America, if they had a single issue that troubled them the most, it was that health care vote.
The tenor of the comments as we got closer and closer to August got dominated by 'Wouldja please get this over with' and not let us go into default.
I like going to rifle and pistol clubs and joining them in target shooting. I also share the same respect for individual initiative and love of family.
