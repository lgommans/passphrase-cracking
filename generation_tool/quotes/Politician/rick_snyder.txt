I'm very proud of the auto industry in Michigan.
But as a practical matter, Detroit's the sports city in the country.
So if you want great sports, Michigan's the place to be.
I'm a proud Republican - there's no issue with that at all, so why can't I be a proud Republican and just try to solve problems?
