Canadian,Politician
You only need a few people to effect a kidnapping.
There was no censorship of the press: in general, the War Measures Act could have been made even more radical.
There was never in my mind a desire to give in on the subject of freeing the political prisoners.
There is nothing more foreign to a civilised and democratic system than preventive detention.
One can always debate questions back and forth.
It seemed to be inadmissible to give in on such a fundamental point. This would have meant that any one who would have wanted to be a terrorist could gain eventually their freedom thanks to another kidnapping.
It is very difficult to know what may be in the back of the mind of public figures.
I have always said that we did not expect a revolution in the streets.
A diplomat had been kidnapped, a cabinet minister had been kidnapped, they were under threats of murder. The police forces were rather tired. After a whole week, we were unable to find those that had effected the kidnappings.
