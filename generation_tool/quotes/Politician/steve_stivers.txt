The advantage of the free market system is that people invest their capital, they create jobs by investing their capital, and hopefully they get a return on that investment. I don't think there's anything wrong with good old American capitalism.
Congress should just do its job and pass a transportation-infrastructure bill - a regular bill that doesn't borrow money and mortgage my future.
You know, capital isn't patriotic. Capital goes to where it needs to go to get a return.
I've actually cut my personal pay individually; we didn't vote on that, but I've done that individually. It's important that folks know that we're going to roll up our sleeves and work on things, and members of Congress are going to sacrifice our own budgets first.
