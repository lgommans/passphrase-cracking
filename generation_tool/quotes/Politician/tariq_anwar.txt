Indian,Politician
My dream is to make Katihar a model district. I have no personal ambition.
I brought several national projects to Katihar.
I have an emotional attachment with Katihar.
Bio-Technology is expected to play a major role in improving productivity.
I have got everything which a politician needs.
Though I am an MP from Maharashtra, my heart beats for Katihar.
You can go and see the Katihar railway station. This is the most beautiful station in Bihar, even better than the Patna junction.
I want to develop Katihar as an ideal district. That is my dream for my constituency.
