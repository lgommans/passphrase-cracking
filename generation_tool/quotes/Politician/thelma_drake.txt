American,Politician
What I see as the greatest threat to America is that the American people will put political pressure on their leaders to pull out of Iraq before we should.
We don't mind that we still have troops in Germany, or that we still have troops in Japan or Korea. But they are not in danger, and we know that they are in danger in Iraq.
We are going to have to be there until we defeat this enemy.
There is only one option in Iraq: that we win.
