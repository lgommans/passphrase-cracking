American,Politician
When we go to Congress, there are strict rules about what I can be involved with and what I can't be involved with when it comes to business relationships and business operations.
In the fall of 2012 I did drop some weight, and then it all came back on and then some, just like the average person who deals with this goes through.
My goal is to feel healthy.
From my perspective, we as a nation need to make policy a priority and drive the politics as a result of good policy.
I think in 2012 one of the primary issues that will get a lot of discussion will be comprehensive tax reform.
I've created an internal rule that Sunday is off-limits unless I put it on the schedule myself. That's family time.
