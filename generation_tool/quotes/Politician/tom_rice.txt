American,Politician
Our Founding Fathers created the Executive Branch to implement and enforce the laws written by Congress, and vested this power in the president.
President Obama has adopted a practice of picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce. In most cases, his laws of choice conveniently coincide with his administration's political agenda.
