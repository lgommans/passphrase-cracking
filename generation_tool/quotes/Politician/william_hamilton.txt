Scottish,Politician
Concrete is, essentially, the color of bad weather.
I simply can't believe nice communities release effluents.
Britain is not a country that is easily rocked by revolution... In Britain our institutions evolve. We are a Fabian Society writ large.
Truth, like a torch, the more it's shook it shines.
The will of the world is never the will of God.
The infinite God can not by us, in the present limitation of our faculties, be comprehended or conceived.
