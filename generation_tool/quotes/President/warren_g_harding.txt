American,President
I don't know what to do or where to turn in this taxation matter. Somewhere there must be a book that tells all about it, where I could go to straighten it out in my mind. But I don't know where the book is, and maybe I couldn't read it if I found it.
America's present need is not heroics but healing; not nostrums but normalcy; not revolution but restoration.
I don't know much about Americanism, but it's a damn good word with which to carry an election.
