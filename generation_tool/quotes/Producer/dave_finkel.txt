A standard sitcom... is a very standard idea, like these people falling in love and living with each other, and all these people living with each other. It's like, okay, we hooked them up in episode 15, how do we bust that, how do we find a new kernel in it?
I liked Norman Lear's ideology that you could trust an audience to stay with you.
There's no such thing as writer's block. I'm brilliant all the time every day. It never stops.
I mean this sincerely... and I don't know why, but there was a period of time that for some reason, whenever 'Charles in Charge' was on, I couldn't not watch it. I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. I just couldn't not watch.
I'm insanely proud of every single one of my credits until the people who created the shows are dead.
