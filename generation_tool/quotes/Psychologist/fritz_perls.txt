Our dependency makes slaves out of us, especially if this dependency is a dependency of our self-esteem. If you need encouragement, praise, pats on the back from everybody, then you make everybody your judge.
I am not in this world to live up to other people's expectations, nor do I feel that the world must live up to mine.
