Boundary setting is really a huge part of time management.
Even if you're ill, physical activity at a lower level will help you beat it.
There's no such thing as multitasking.
Time only has value when it intersects with energy.
It's not how many hours you put in with a client or on a project. It's the quantity and quality of your energy - your focus and force - that determine whether that time is valuable.
The most important asset you need to protect in order to manage the demands of a job or an investment portfolio is your production of energy. And, just like with money, if you do a great job managing your energy, you'll get a great return.
When people are entering a high-stress period, they don't sleep and don't exercise, but in fact, it should be just the opposite.
