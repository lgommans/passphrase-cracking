In any country, governance issues are there. Challenges are there, pressures are there. When multi-party coalitions take decisions, sometimes delays will be there. But that is what democracy is: it is beauty or it's challenge.
I don't think countries engage with each other looking at immediate gains. It's building a partnership.
India does not encourage - India has forbidden - child labour. We are a rule-based and rule-governed country.
