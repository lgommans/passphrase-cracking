American,Public Servant
I believe that Bill Clinton will be remembered as one of our nation's great Presidents, and Senator Clinton as one of our nation's great public servants.
The hardest decisions in life are not between good and bad or right and wrong, but between two goods or two rights.
The Democratic Party is on the move across the country. Voters are responding to our message of progress and fiscal responsibility.
Today I am announcing my support for Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States of America.
I ask Hoosiers to come together and vote for Barack Obama to be our next President.
You can be for someone without being against someone else.
You can unite behind a candidate and a vision for America without rejecting another candidate and their vision, because in real life, opposed to party politics, we Democrats are on the same side.
My endorsement of Senator Obama will not be welcome news to my friends and family at the Clinton campaign.
