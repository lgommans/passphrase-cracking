Even a secret agent can't lie to a Jewish mother.
I spent a lot of time in churches. If you go to a synagogue, someone is always asking if you're alone, if you're married. In a church, in a hundred years no one would ask.
Many times I asked myself, 'Who is a painter in your own eyes?'
The problem here is with a human being, not with a monster, not with an animal. The human being does things that even the monster does not do, because the human is more sophisticated.
Writing and Painting are the same for me.
