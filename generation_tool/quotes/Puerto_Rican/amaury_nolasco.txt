Puerto Rican,Actor
If you have a brother or sister, tell them you love them every day - that's the most beautiful thing. I told my sister how much I loved her every day. That's the only reason I'm OK right now.
When I left Chicago, people said, 'Careful with that Texas heat'. I'm like, 'I'm from Puerto Rico. I know heat.'
You know how when people lose their grandma or grandpa, people they say they're sorry? They do mean it, but... there's nothing to say. There's a void that cannot be filled.
These displays of affection mean a lot to our family and are a reminder of the heart that my people have. In this time of grief we ask for a little privacy and space to digest this news; our sister was our sun and we are broken by her departure.
I believe, and I may be wrong, the system sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Prison is supposed to rehabilitate, but they don't do that in a lot of cases.
I am more of a surprise kind of guy. I love to find out as I go.
When you dare me to do something, I will say, 'Watch me'. That is what I say to critics. 'Watch me'.
I hate to go to movies or watch a TV show and know the ending within 15 minutes.
Imagine somebody says you are going to die in a few weeks; I'd really rather not know.
