Puerto Rican,Actor
I can't live without a sense of humor. I need to be laughing and entertained at all times.
I would love to continue working on animated films. Yeah, those are my ambitions. No doubt.
I think my favorite thing is songwriting.
I'd say it's even harder to cater to Hispanics than to the lesbian or gay community. We're so culturally separated: Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Venezuelans. We're all so different.
Coming in and out of Hollywood for pilot season, I may have to thicken my accent or hear that, physically, I'm not Latino. I not only am, but there's another 50,000 people who look exactly like me.
I take my kids to school... I make them breakfast. Unfortunately, dad is a big spoiler, and most days, I make four different breakfasts.
