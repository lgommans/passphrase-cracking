No government fights fascism to destroy it. When the bourgeoisie sees that power is slipping out of its hands, it brings up fascism to hold onto their privileges.
We carry a new world here, in our hearts. That world is growing this minute.
We are ready to end fascism once and for all, even in spite of the Republican government.
We are going to inherit the earth; there is not the slightest doubt about that.
The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history.
There are only two roads, victory for the working class, freedom, or victory for the fascists which means tyranny. Both combatants know what's in store for the loser.
It is we the workers who built these palaces and cities here in Spain and in America and everywhere. We, the workers, can build others to take their place. And better ones! We are not in the least afraid of ruins.
