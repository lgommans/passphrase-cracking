Revolutionary
I am the son of peasants and I know what is happening in the villages. That is why I wanted to take revenge, and I regret nothing.
I only know that I fired twice, or perhaps several times, without knowing whether I had hit or missed.
I aimed at the Archduke. I do not remember what I thought at that moment.
