Let us celebrate the occasion with wine and sweet words.
Nothing is more wretched than the mind of a man conscious of guilt.
Patience is the best remedy for every trouble.
The day, water, sun, moon, night - I do not have to purchase these things with money.
I would rather be adorned by beauty of character than jewels. Jewels are the gift of fortune, while character comes from within.
Flight without feathers is not easy.
Nothing but heaven itself is better than a friend who is really a friend.
For nobody is curious, who isn't malevolent.
Man is not man, but a wolf to those he does not know.
A mouse does not rely on just one hole.
Courage in danger is half the battle.
Friendship is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.
The greatest talents often lie buried out of sight.
Persevere in virtue and diligence.
Where there are friends there is wealth.
Good merchandise, even hidden, soon finds buyers.
Wisdom is not attained by years, but by ability.
The poor man who enters into a partnership with one who is rich makes a risky venture.
Your wealth is where your friends are.
Every man, however wise, needs the advice of some sagacious friend in the affairs of life.
Property is unstable, and youth perishes in a moment. Life itself is held in the grinning fangs of Death, Yet men delay to obtain release from the world. Alas, the conduct of mankind is surprising.
How great in number are the little minded men.
Let deeds match words.
If you have overcome your inclination and not been overcome by it, you have reason to rejoice.
No blessing lasts forever.
Conquered, we conquer.
