Romanian,Businessman
I don't need to impress children.
I have 18 cars, but I never had a Rolls-Royce.
I have every single Ferrari that came out. I have all the Mercedes they came out with, all the Jaguars they came out with, all the Porsches they came out with.
I have a Lamborghini Diablo. I have Mercedes 600, a 500, a 300, a 190. I have a Ferrari Testarossa, a Porsche speedster.
Some players get over-dependable on their coaches.
I am not Shakespeare or Hemingway, but I have written stories on tennis that were brilliant.
Me writing about tennis is like a baker baking bread.
I eat leftover caviar by hand, with baked potato, like peasants.
