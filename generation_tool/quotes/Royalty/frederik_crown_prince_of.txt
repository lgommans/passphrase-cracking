Royalty
Greenland is a wonderful country.
I don't have to make my own bed.
My mum had me brought up by nannies and governesses. I didn't have much to do with my parents until I was 21.
I am just an apprentice.
My role as king will be much like my mum's as queen, so long as I remain in tune with the people.
Father of four. I like the sound of that.
I would just like to have children. Lots of children.
Going to the Arctic was immense for me.
Historically, royal families have represented an institution. The institution is built on heritage, and is timeless in that sense.
I hope that my family will continue in another thousand years.
