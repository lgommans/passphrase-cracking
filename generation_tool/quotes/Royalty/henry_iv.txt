Royalty
It is in the midst of disasters that bold men grow bolder.
I want there to be no peasant in my kingdom so poor that he cannot have a chicken in his pot every Sunday.
I had rather be plundered by my enemies than by my friends.
Paris must not be a cemetery. I do not wish to reign over the dead.
I would willingly give fifty thousand crowns to be able to say that I took Paris without costing the life of one single man.
Religion is not changed as easily as a shirt.
