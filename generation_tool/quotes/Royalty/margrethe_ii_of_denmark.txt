I will remain on the throne until I fall off.
One shouldn't write one's own epitaph. I hope people will remember me as one who did her best - and who wasn't an anachronism.
I smoke wherever there's an ashtray.
The time that I devote to painting is not a lot of time, but I do it 100 percent while I am working, and then there's nothing else that counts.
I can, of course, think what I want, just like everyone else. I simply have to refrain from saying everything I think.
We are being challenged by Islam these years. There are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.
There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam.
There are, of course, always painters whom I admire and find fascinating. I've often thought, 'Goodness, if I could paint like the Danish Golden Age painters, the early 19th century painters, the way they could paint a landscape - absolutely beautiful.'
Painting is not what my life is about, but it is very important to me, and I am very lucky to be able to give some time to it.
I hope I will be able to paint as long as I live.
