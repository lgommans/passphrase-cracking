If you skate too slow, it's not feeling comfortable at all.
My mother gave up everything for me. In Yekaterinburg, she had a job and an apartment in the centre of the city and her whole life. And in Moscow - nothing.
The main thing for me now is figure skating, which I intend to devote more than one year.
