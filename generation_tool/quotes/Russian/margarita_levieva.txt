Russian,Actress
I was always the serious kid.
I'm not an insecure person, per se, but I just never saw myself as the girl who walks into a place and everybody goes, 'Wow.'
I don't usually have those 'twin experiences' that people talk about.
I grew up in communist Russia where we didn't have anything, so I'm not worried that I can't buy an extra pair of shoes.
I'm Russian Jewish. And I had to grow up really quickly.
I had to dance in a Tweety Bird costume once.
One of my first commercials was for a Samsung cellphone. It was made as a mini-movie.
