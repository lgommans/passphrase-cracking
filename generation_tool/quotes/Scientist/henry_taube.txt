The benefits of science are not to be reckoned only in terms of the physical.
Science as an intellectual exercise enriches our culture, and is in itself ennobling.
And as we continue to improve our understanding of the basic science on which applications increasingly depend, material benefits of this and other kinds are secured for the future.
My own interest in basic aspects of electron transfer between metal complexes became active only after I came to the University of Chicago in 1946.
