If we do not voluntarily bring population growth under control in the next one or two decades, the nature will do it for us in the most brutal way, whether we like it or not.
Many people and governments share the mistaken belief that science, with new, ingenious devices and techniques, can rescue us from the troubles we face without our having to mend our ways and change our patterns of activity. This is not so.
We must act swiftly in order to halt the rate of decay our planet faces.
Education of both men and women is a wonderful contraceptive.
We must... guarantee women control over their own reproductive decisions.
The destruction of our environment and resources cannot be stemmed unless the growth of the world's population is stemmed and ultimately reduced.
Governments must now take a leading role in moving their nations in the right direction.
