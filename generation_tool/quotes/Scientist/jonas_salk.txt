The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.
I have had dreams and I have had nightmares, but I have conquered my nightmares because of my dreams.
There is hope in dreams, imagination, and in the courage of those who wish to make those dreams a reality.
It is always with excitement that I wake up in the morning wondering what my intuition will toss up to me, like gifts from the sea. I work with it and rely on it. It's my partner.
Hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality.
I pictured myself as a virus or a cancer cell and tried to sense what it would be like.
Nothing happens quite by chance. It's a question of accretion of information and experience.
Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.
The worst tragedy that could have befallen me was my success. I knew right away that I was through - cast out.
