I guess that's just the life of an inventor: what people do with your ideas takes you totally by surprise.
I hope I'm saving lives. There are very few people in their careers that have the opportunity to do something to benefit mankind.
Even in my neighborhood, the kids come to me for interviews for their term papers. I ask them later what grades they got, and they're always A-pluses.
Not long ago, I got to meet some troopers whose lives had been saved. They came with their wives, their children, their parents. It was a very moving occasion.
