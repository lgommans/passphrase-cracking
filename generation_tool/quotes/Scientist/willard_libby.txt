You honor me greatly and beyond my ability as an individual but in so doing you honor my colleagues also who made possible the results you have cited.
We hope that this honor you have done us will bring the time of further realization of these benefits closer and will help all mankind to live better and be happier through the atom and isotopes.
True, the initial ideas are in general those of an individual, but the establishment of the reality and truth is in general the work of more than one person.
Most achievements in science are to a certain degree group efforts.
And yet the Nobel Prizes, in singling out individuals, have done a great deal of good in pointing up to the world as a whole and setting forth clearly goals for achievement.
