If you have men who will only come if they know there is a good road, I don't want them. I want men who will come if there is no road at all.
I determined never to stop until I had come to the end and achieved my purpose.
I will go anywhere, provided it is forward.
I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward.
I will place no value on anything I have or may possess except in relation to the kingdom of Christ.
Nothing earthly will make me give up my work in despair.
All that I am I owe to Jesus Christ, revealed to me in His divine Book.
Fear God and work hard.
