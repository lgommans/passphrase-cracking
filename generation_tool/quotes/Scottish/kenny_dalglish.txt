I was putting myself under enormous pressure to be successful.
Paul Lambert has assembled a great bunch of lads and training has been going very well. I am just desperate to get into the team and do my best for the club.
I am absolutely delighted to get back into football with Livingston.
What is called for is dignity. We need to set an example.
I had to know if I could make it somewhere else. I did not want to go through the rest of my life wondering what might have been without putting myself to the test.
The scoreline is a bit flattering really.
It has been an honor and a privilege to have had the chance to come back to Liverpool Football Club as manager.
We have got a problem winning games in the league. We have to educate ourselves and maybe we have to not play the lovely football that we have been.
