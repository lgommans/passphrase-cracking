American,Soldier
I shall begin my march for Camp tomorrow morning. It was not in my power to move until I could procure shoes for the troops almost barefoot.
Our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free.
Upon the whole it was a Glorious day-Our men are in the Spirits-and I am confident we shall give them a total defeat the next Action; which is at no great distance.
Issue the orders Sir, and I will storm Hell.
