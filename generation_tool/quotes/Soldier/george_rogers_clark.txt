American,Soldier
I am George Rogers Clark. You have just become a prisoner of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
The sword is very handsome. I am too old and infirm, as you see, to ever use a sword again, but I am glad that my old mother state has not entirely forgotten me.
Damn the sword! When Virginia wanted a sword, I gave her one. Now she sends me a toy! I require bread!
