We need to make sure that we have one another's back and recognize the fact that patriots come in all different sizes, shapes, colors, not all of them wear uniforms, some of them are employers, some of them are the family members who stay at home and take of business back here in the state of Oklahoma.
We had the best-equipped and we have the best-trained military force on the face of the earth, right here in Oklahoma.
The United States Air Force didn't even become a separate service until 1947.
