American,Soldier
We entered Gettysburg in the afternoon, just in time to meet the enemy entering the town, and in good season to drive him back before his getting a foothold.
I am willing to serve my country, but do not wish to sacrifice the brave men under my command.
It is too late; now I wish I could live.
The zeal, bravery, and good behavior of the officers and men on the night of June 30, and during July 1, was commendable in the extreme.
If I have any choice I would prefer Western Troops.
If the regulars are to be put together, I believe they would prefer me to the other Cavalry Commanders.
I am disgusted and worn out with the system that seems to prevail.
Found everybody in a terrible state of excitement on account of the enemy's advance upon this place.
I have not been able to get any grain yet. It is all in the country, and the people talk instead of working.
General: I attempted to take Williamsport yesterday, but found too large a force of infantry and artillery. After a long fight, I withdrew to this place.
I can do nothing with the enemy save observe him.
Shortly after this, I placed my command on our extreme left, to watch and fight the enemy should he make another attack, and went to Cemetary Hill for observation.
There was splendid fighting on the part of the division on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th. There was no faltering or hesitation. Each man went to work determined to carry anything in reason.
During the whole campaign, from June 27 to July 31, there has been no shirking or hesitation, to tiring on the part of a single man so far as I have seen; the brigade commanders reported none.
