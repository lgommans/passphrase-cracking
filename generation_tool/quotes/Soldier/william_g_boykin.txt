American,Soldier
I do stand in opposition to those who want to implement Sharia and essentially attack the Constitution of the United States.
Those Muslims in America's army that stand with the Constitution, I support them, and I think we all have to.
If there is no God, there is no hope.
There is no greater threat to America than Islam.
