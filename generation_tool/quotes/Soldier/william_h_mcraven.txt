If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.
You can't change the world alone - you will need some help - and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends, colleagues, the good will of strangers and a strong coxswain to guide them.
If you can't do the little things right, you will never do the big things right.
I think the best way to get a good night sleep is to work hard throughout the day. If you work hard and, of course, work out.
If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle.
Basic SEAL training is six months of long, torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.
SEAL training was a great equalizer. Nothing mattered but your will to succeed. Not your color, not your ethnic background, not your education and not your social status.
My wife and I make the bed every morning, but it's a queen size bed today, as opposed to a rack, you know, a small single bed, which I had in basic SEAL training.
I'm not a political guy.
To me, basic SEAL training was a lifetime of challenges crammed into six months.
I think ninjas are probably quieter than SEALs, but we are better swimmers, and also better with guns and blowing things up.
