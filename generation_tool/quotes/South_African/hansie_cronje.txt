I realized I made a big mistake and if I could have it over again, I would do it so much differently.
I always played to win.
I love surfing more than cricket, more interesting and you meet great people.

It's good fun, yes, but when we play, we take it seriously and want to do well.
The very quick and high sales of the book caught us off guard, but fortunately we got the second edition from the printers at the end of last week and the shops should now be stocked again.
We didn't sleep last week - we literally didn't sleep - because we've been so busy with the book.
We really tried hard not to make it a cricket book, it appeals to a much wider community.
