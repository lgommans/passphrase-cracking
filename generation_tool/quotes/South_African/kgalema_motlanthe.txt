South African,Politician
I have a political attitude, but I'm certainly not a politician.
Once it gets to a point where it becomes a matter of life and death to occupy a position of leadership or not, with an eye on future opportunities, therein lies the danger.
I don't want to lead an organization where I have no sense of what the members think of me - and by arrangement. I would never do that.
I know exactly what I will do. I will go and work with the Congress of South African Students.
If there are activists in Cosas and they do poorly academically, then they would be cited as examples as to why others should not be in Cosas.
