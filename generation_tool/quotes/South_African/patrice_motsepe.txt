South African,Businessman
Education is at the heart of achieving your dreams.
If we continue doing the right things in Africa, we can create a very exciting and competitive global market here.
You have to have a globally competitive mining dispensation.
My comrades would call me a 'black capitalist.'
I've heard people say South Africans are arrogant, that they act no differently from their colonial masters. That needs to change. It's in your business interest as an entrepreneur to form meaningful partnerships. That's how you do well for your shareholders.
I have confidence in mining. I see exciting opportunities in it.
Abe Krok was a man of integrity who made a unique contribution to Mamelodi Sundowns and to South African football.
The relationship between ARMgold and Harmony continues to develop and grow.
Youth all over the world are very hungry to succeed.
South Africans are caring, compassionate and loving people.
The system of creating opportunities for those who were by law excluded, you've got to do that. But you mustn't create a perception that the process is devoid of competitiveness... devoid of building a world class, sustainable black business community.
People don't know that there were very successful black businessmen in the years of apartheid.
Only in South Africa could you have a change in government without civil war. If there wasn't the depth of love and caring among our people, this would not have happened.
You could be worth $2 billion today and a half a billion tomorrow. It doesn't take much for this to disappear overnight.
