To be free and to live a free life - that is the most beautiful thing there is.
I inherited that calm from my father, who was a farmer. You sow, you wait for good or bad weather, you harvest, but working is something you always need to do.
My strength was that I am more balanced and calmer than most other riders.
I didn't feel I had to prove anything more.
If I had been born with an aggressive character, then maybe my palmares would have been longer.
I have earned enough to take it a bit easier now.
I did try to win a sixth, but it was not to be.
Sooner or later a rider will emerge who will win more Tours. In every sport we have seen how the records eventually get broken and cycling is no exception.
