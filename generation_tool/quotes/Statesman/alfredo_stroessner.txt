I have to think of my status as a resident in this country. But I do insist that in Paraguay there was order; the judiciary had the power of complete independence; justice was fully exercised.
I was always confident that I knew. I never expected this.
There was no reason for a revolution in Paraguay.
We can't make any statements here. We can't talk about the internal politics of Paraguay.
