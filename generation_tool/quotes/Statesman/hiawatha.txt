Statesman
Instead of a man of peace and love, I have become a man of violence and revenge.
Every human longs for peace and love.
Peace will be when you accept it in your heart.
All the other chiefs and tribes have accepted the Great Law of Peace. They now live in peace with one another.
It was not the path I was to take. Because of my deeds, I will never know peace again.
