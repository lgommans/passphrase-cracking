Uruguayan,Statesman
Practicing medicine is not only my vocation, it gives me an opportunity to continue to be in direct contact with people, to see them and hear their needs.
I invite you, from my sentiments, my convictions and my responsibilities, to work together in the construction of a Uruguay where being young is not suspicious, where aging is not a problem.
It's not enough to have economic growth. You have to distribute wealth throughout all of society.
The decisions and problems of Uruguay will be resolved by Uruguayans.
Because of my medical and ideological training, I am accustomed to saying that life is adaptation and symbiosis.
I was fascinated by each area I studied, whether neurology, urology or surgery.
To me, politics is an extension of what I do in medicine.
