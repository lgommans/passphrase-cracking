Fragrance is, to me, something very personal; because it is something you wear every day, it should represent you and be an extension of your style.
I'm obsessed with vinyasa flow yoga and Pilates. And since I live in Sweden, and we have good seafood, I tend to cook a lot of fish, preferably with oven-roasted veggies and a cauliflower mash.
I try to be as organic and natural as possible when it comes to make up, so I always carry around coconut oil for removing and jojoba or Argan oil as a moisturiser.
A Maybelline New York woman is strong and confident - I love that attitude.
I'm honored and thrilled to represent such an iconic brand and to be a part of the Maybelline New York family.
