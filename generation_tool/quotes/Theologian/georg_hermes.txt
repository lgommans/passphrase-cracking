German,Theologian
The soul passeth from form to form; and the mansions of her pilgrimage are manifold.
From one Soul of the Universe are all Souls derived.
Not all human souls but only the pious ones are divine.
Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.
