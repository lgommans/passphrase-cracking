The luxury we have when we do a series is that we go through a long journey, and it keeps a lot of information and things to be revealed.
I love improvisation. It's quite exciting.
Life is tragic comedy, in a way. There is humor.
In theater, there's a lot of work to do to build the characters. It's a great experience.
