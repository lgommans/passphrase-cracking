When I read 'Dream of Red Mansions,' I was really struck by the fact that it was built differently from a lot of genre works. Specifically, a lot of the events that should have taken centre-stage - wars, social upheavals - were seen entirely through the eyes of the women of a Chinese household.
It certainly seems as though a great majority of genre is conflict-focused and, not only that, but focused on large physical conflicts.
