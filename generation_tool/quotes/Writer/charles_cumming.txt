Worrying about how you'll be remembered is pointless. Better to try to live your life in such a way that people will respect you while you're still alive.
I'm fascinated by the journey that an intelligent and an ambitious woman makes in the professional world in contrast to the journey that a man of similar ambition, of similar intelligence makes. What sort of concessions does a woman have to make? Does she have to work 20 percent harder than a man?
As we get older, life becomes very complicated in terms of concessions we have to make.
I find a difference in British spy fiction and American spy fiction. In the American version, it's more militaristic, partly because the CIA has more of the military makeup. Whereas MI6 is more of a cerebral, intelligence-based, relationship-based service, i.e., all they do is recruit people to get information out of them.
I enjoy writing.
I'm not good with bullies and zealots.
