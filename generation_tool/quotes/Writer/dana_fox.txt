I am really looking for a chance to direct. I feel like that's kind of the next frontier for me. I know that it's really hard to do, but I feel like I want to have a chance to try and translate something I've written and try and get a tone across.
It's harder and harder to make a well-done romantic comedy these days because the conventions have been so played out.
I had amazing stuff happen right off the top. I thought this was how it worked. Hollywood is awesome! Cut to three years later: What happened?
I'm a believer in paying your dues.
My big philosophy is: Try and work with good people, because the process is your life. That's going to be really, really hard. I'm glad I learned the lesson, 'Failure is OK.'
I won't say, 'I have two degrees; I shouldn't be getting your latte.' Because I paid my dues when I got to the table, I actually had something to say.
Audiences know exactly what's coming and they know from the beginning of the movie that everything's going to be OK and there will be high jinks that will get you from the beginning to the end, and eventually all the misunderstandings will be worked out and everyone will be in love.
It's rare to find women who have that balance between work and life, who are really psyched for another woman's success.
