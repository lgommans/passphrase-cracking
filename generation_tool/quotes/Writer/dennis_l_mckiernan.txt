American,Writer
A middle child, I was born in the depths of the Great Depression. My dad and mom were factory workers, struggling to make ends meet.
Upon graduation from high school, following my brother by a couple of years, I joined the U.S. Air Force.
In 1989, I retired from Bell Laboratories to become a full-time writer. Not that I didn't enjoy my engineering career, but rather I liked being a novelist just a bit better.
The Kwajalein waters are incredibly lucid: vision typically up to three hundred feet.
