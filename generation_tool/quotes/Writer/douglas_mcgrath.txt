I can remember my sister and me volunteering for Nixon. My parents liked him. I liked my parents. So I figured he was good.
Since cable got the power and freedom it has, you can explore someone in a way you couldn't in the old days when Mannix was Mannix was Mannix. I thought maybe that Nixon would be an interesting series.
You can think deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into a subject, depending on what you are writing about.
There is nothing quite like 'The Night of the Hunter'. I have never seen a film to which it can be fairly compared.
