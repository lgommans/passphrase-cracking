British,Writer
Everyday holds the possibility of a miracle.
Writing doesn't come easily to me. It gets more and more difficult.
I'm very interested in my new kitchen equipment shop. I've started it with two friends.
I don't copy recipes without trying them out. I don't reprint without trying them again.
An awful lot of people think it's easy to lift recipes out.
