Not all of our work is dark, but when we are working on a dark project, we really tend to go there.
We're always attracted to characters who are people we could identify with and yet are put through incredibly tortured or difficult circumstances - the idea being that you don't really know who you are until you've been tested or suffered in some way.
We can't really make a living doing comic books, despite the fact that would be an awfully fun way to make a living.
In our office, we have a whiteboard with all of our ideas and things we want to write on it - great ideas we have that we haven't had the time to get around to yet.
