American,Writer
I'm a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy.
I've always wanted to write a novel. It's overwhelming and daunting, and it's one of those things that every writer fantasizes about doing.
I'm one of three brothers.
Traditionally, people have been adapting novels and short stories forever. Now, they're doing it simultaneously, with an eye towards writing the movie before the novel has even come out or been finished. It's a function of this hyper-accelerated society we live in, where everyone is trying to short circuit the process.
Where I came from, no one was a writer.
