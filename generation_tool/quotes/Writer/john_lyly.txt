The true measure of life is not length, but honesty.
A clear conscience is a sure card.
Night hath a thousand eyes.
As the best wine doth make the sharpest vinegar, so the deepest love turneth to the deadliest hate.
We might knit that knot with our tongues that we shall never undo with our teeth.
Marriages are made in heaven and consummated on Earth.
Where the mind is past hope, the heart is past shame.
He that loseth his honesty hath nothing else to lose.
The sun shineth upon the dunghill, and is not corrupted.
A merry companion is as good as a wagon.
To give reason for fancy were to weigh the fire, and measure the wind.
