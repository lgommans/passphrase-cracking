American,Writer
I keep an ongoing list of my fifty favorite books, which I recalibrate whenever I discover a new one that seems to demand a spot there.
I'm a Sagittarius, born in the year of the rat, all of which is basically meaningless to me.
I write out of gratitude for all the books I have loved over the years.
I can tell you that I never begin working on a story until I have a title centered at the top of the first page.
