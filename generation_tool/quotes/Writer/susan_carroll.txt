American,Writer
I have been intrigued by Catherine de Medici and the legends surrounding her for a long time.
I am not an analytical writer. Once I flesh out my characters and decide on the elements of my plot, the story unfolds in my head almost as though it was a movie reel.
I freely admit that I took great license in writing 'The Dark Queen,' more so than my other historical romance novels. This is largely because I viewed the book as a fantasy novel as much as an historical. I do feel that writers should strive for as much accuracy as possible but, in the end, remember that we are writing fiction.
I feel all the religions should be able to co-exist if the various factions would be willing to respect and learn from each other's faiths.
