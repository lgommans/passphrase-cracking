I'm a voracious reader. I also have a ton of favorite TV shows I'm addicted to.
Ninety percent of my ideas come to me either when I'm reading or watching a show.
I loved Alessandra Torre's 'Black Lies.'
I'm quite adept at writing two or sometimes even three stories at once. So if I get stuck on one story, I switch the next and let my subconscious work on unraveling any plot problems from another story.
