 ...Prepared in innocence to meet our king of glory 
 And so we have this 
 You have it in your secret windows 
 And you're understanding to understand it and to bring it forth 
 It takes minute detail 
 It takes a holy life 
 It takes emotions 
 It takes dedication 
 It takes dedication 
 It takes a death 
 And only god can allow it 
 And you couldn't do it if you're not the seed of god 
 And so the path through the great corridors 
 These are corridors unto his perfection 
 That is which the prophet and the Urim and Thummim has penetrated 
 That through this great sea of blackness 
 That I penetrated through these corridors 
 And I went through that last segment 
 Where I went through these dark serpentines 
 I passed through that corridor 
 Where they sat 
 Where they are 
 And when you penetrate to the most high God 
 You will believe you are mad 
 You will believe you've gone insane 
 But I tell you, if you follow the secret window 
 And you die to the ego nature 
 You will penetrate this darkness. 
 Oh yes, there's many a man or woman 
 That's been put in the insane asylum 
 When this has happened to them 
 And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane 
 But they saw something that's real 
 And they see it when they're on drugs 
 The only thing is they see it 
 Not through the light of God, and the way I show you 
 I show you to see it through the light of God 
 And the understanding of God 
 Because when you see the face of God you will die 
 And there will be nothing left of you 
 Except the God-man, the God-woman 
 The heavenly man, the heavenly woman 
 The heavenly child 
 There will be terror under this day of night 
 There will be a song of jubilee waiting for your king 
 There will be nothing you will be looking for in this world 
 Except for your God 
 This is all a dream 
 A dream in death. 
 And so I went through that window 
 And the tower of hell and the great serpentines of the highest order 
 And I went through that when I showed you chart #3

 What'll we do with the baby? 
 What'll we do with the baby-o? 
 What'll we do with the baby? 
 What'll we do with the baby-o? 
 Wrap him up in a tablecloth 
 Throw him up in the old hayloft 
 That's what we do with the baby 
 That's what we do with the baby-o 
 Every time the baby grins, 
 Give my baby another bottle of gin 
 That's what we do with the baby 
 That's what we do with the baby-o 
 Every time the baby cries 
 Stick my finger in the babies eyes 
 That's what we do with the baby 
 That's what we do with the baby-o

 (Instrumental)The Dead Flag Blues (Intro) 
 The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel 
 And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides 
 And a dark wind blows 
 The government is corrupt 
 And we're on so many drugs 
 With the radio on and the curtains drawn 
 We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine 
 And the machine is bleeding to death 
 The sun has fallen down 
 And the billboards are all leering 
 And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles 
 It went like this: 
 The buildings tumbled in on themselves 
 Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble 
 And pulled out their hair 
 The skyline was beautiful on fire 
 All twisted metal stretching upwards 
 Everything washed in a thin orange haze 
 I said: "kiss me, you're beautiful - 
 These are truly the last days" 
 You grabbed my hand and we fell into it 
 Like a daydream or a fever 
 We woke up one morning and fell a little further down - 
 For sure it's the valley of death 
 I open up my wallet 
 And it's full of blood

 (Instrumental)Interviewer: Well... Where are you coming from? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: (pause) Well... I don't like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and, erm... that's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem. The government... the American government - they're sneaky, they're very deceitful, they're liars, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government is one systematic government that... that nobody can trust. I don't trust them myself. 
 Interviewer: And how long have you been writing for? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Huh? 
 Interviewer: How long have you been writing for? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Since I was four. 
 Interviewer: Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do open-mics, absolutely. 
 Interviewer: What kind of reactions do you usually get? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Usually, people are... are pretty much in agreement with what I'm saying. 
 Interviewer: We overheard you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding ticket? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: That's accurate. 
 Interviewer: right. Do you wanna tell us that story? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... "Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody," I said. I says... "I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour." I says "I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket ...and I'm here to get my fines out of the way and get the fuck to work." The judge says "You can't talk like that in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court." then I said... I told the judge, "If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you." I said "Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen." I said "I'm not gonna take any shit." I said "I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket like I said." I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25 dollars and I says "Here's my money, now I am leaving." 
 And I left it at that. 
 (At this point the interview fades whilst the music grows in intensity) 
 Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge "I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you." I said "If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would." And the judge says "Yeah, you have a point," He goes "You don't need to get loud," I said "Don't get loud?" I says "I've got every right to get loud." I says "You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it. You think you're god because you have a robe and you can put people up the goddamn river for 20 years? Well you're not." 
 And I left it at that. 
 Interviewer: Did you walk away? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes I did... I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this country's government. I just don't like it, because... they're sneaky, like I said - they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, they rip people off. That's the American government for you. America is a third world country, and people don't recognise it... and I think that that's pretty god damn sad, that they don't recognise their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slum. 
 Interviewer: Well... Do you have any weapons? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, I do. I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle... 
 Interviewer: Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: No way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse. Like I said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it stands. 
 Interviewer: What do you think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even got a mind that's that... that inhumane. 
 Interviewer: are you ready for what's coming? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Ready as I'll ever be. 
 Interviewer: Most people aren't. 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: There's a little saying... Dates back for generations... 
 Interviewer: Go on... 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of it. 
 Interviewer: Would you mind reciting your poem for us? 
 Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Not at all, I don't see why... I don't see why I couldn't. 
 There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind 
 It's not state of the art, it's a serious state of the mind 
 The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite 
 A menace to society, a social disease 
 To brainwash the mind is a social disorder 
 The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order 
 Watching beginnings of social decay 
 Gloating and sneering at life's disarray 
 Eating away at your own self esteem 
 Pouncing on every word that you might be saying 
 To attack someone's mind is a social disorder 
 The constitution, the government, martial law order 
 Superficially smiling a shake of the hand 
 As soon as your back is turned treason is planned 
 When every good thing's laid to rest 
 By the governments hate, by the constitution and their lies 
 And every time you think you're safe 
 And when you go to turn away 
 You know they're sharpening all their knives 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to relate it 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to escape it 
 Without a conscience they destroy 
 And that's a thing that they enjoy 
 They're a sickness that's in all of our minds 
 They want to sink the ship and leave 
 The way they laugh at you and me 
 You know it happens all the time 
 But it only happens in your mind 
 The rats in the cellar you know who you are... 
 Or do you?

 You will believe you've gone insane 
 But I tell you, if you follow the secret window 
 And you die to the ego nature 
 You will penetrate this darkness. 
 Oh yes, there's many a man or woman 
 That's been put in the insane asylum 
 When this has happened to them 
 And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane 
 But they saw something that's real 
 And they see it when they're on drugs 
 The only thing is they see it 
 Not through the light of God, and the way I show you 
 I show you to see it through the light of God 
 And the understanding of God 
 Because when you see the face of God you will die 
 And there will be nothing left of you 
 Except the God-man, the God-woman 
 The heavenly man, the heavenly woman 
 The heavenly child 
 There will be terror under this day of night 
 There will be a song of jubilee waiting for your king 
 There will be nothing you will be looking for in this world 
 Except for your God 
 This is all a dream 
 A dream in death. 
 And so I went through that window 
 And the tower of hell and the great serpentines of the highest order 
 And I went through that when I showed you chart #3

 InstrumentalThe Dead Flag Blues (Intro) 
 The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel 
 And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides 
 And a dark wind blows 
 The government is corrupt 
 And we're on so many drugs 
 With the radio on and the curtains drawn 
 We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine 
 And the machine is bleeding to death 
 The sun has fallen down 
 And the billboards are all leering 
 And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles 
 It went like this: 
 The buildings tumbled in on themselves 
 Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble 
 And pulled out their hair 
 The skyline was beautiful on fire 
 All twisted metal stretching upwards 
 Everything washed in a thin orange haze 
 I said: "kiss me, you're beautiful - 
 These are truly the last days" 
 You grabbed my hand and we fell into it 
 Like a daydream or a fever 
 We woke up one morning and fell a little further down - 
 For sure it's the valley of death 
 I open up my wallet 
 And it's full of blood

 What kind of thing should I do? 
 Eh... I don't know. 
 Yeah? 
 What's my motivation? 
 Ooh that sounded- 
 How 'bout like that?On silver mount zion 
 All buried in ruins 
 We was dancing the horro 
 Until we vomited black 
 Spinning like crazy 
 Sheshana was jonesin' 
 The towers had fallen 
 And the wind called out 
 My grandfather's name 
 Let's kill first the banker 
 With his professional demeanor 
 Let's televise and broadcast 
 The raping of kings 
 Let our crowds be fed on 
 Tear gas and plate glass 
 'Cause the people united 
 Is a wonderful thing 
 I know that your dying 
 And I know I'm unwell 
 And together we sashay 
 Through variations of hell 
 As you walk through clouds of fire 
 The love in my head was never real 
 Oh don't be afraid 
 Though the parade 
 Will not pass our way 
 It's nobler to never get paid 
 Than to bank on shit and dismayYou lie in the snow, cold but not dead 
 Stare into the sun, long since its last heat 
 Feel the freeze burn skin 
 Salt your open wounds 
 A burning desire clears your eyes 
 A willful air fills your lungs 
 You choke your first breath of wildfire and ocean's depth 
 Climb out of your hole, see your spirit take form 
 This world of cold stone gives nothing in return 
 To those who sleep while the restless burn 
 There are the few driven to flame 
 Most are content to drown in the wake of dreamsThe Dead Flag Blues (Intro)

 But that goes out to whatever carnival all over the world, all over the countries. And a lot of freakof natures were put into it. Used to call them "geeks." A "geek" was a person who was an alcoholic or on drugs. And they put 'em in a cage, and he was a wild-man. But they stopped that in the cities and they... but the carnival got traveled in the country... they still had the "geeks." They'd all come pay money to see a man, like an animal in a cage. 
 But uh, it wasn't done because it was uh uh uh a playground... you see, some for the first time were amazed... and you remember it was part of the sideshow. But today they got so many "geeks" out there... that they're actually running amongst the public, not in a cage where they should be.

 Where are you going?*INTERVIEWER and BLAISE BAILEY FINNEGAN III 
 - Just where ah - Just where you coming from? 
 - Well... I don't like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and erm... that's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem. The governm, th-the American government - they're sneaky, they're-they're very deceitful, they're-they're-the liers, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government is one i-is one systematic government that-that nobody can trust. *I* don't trust 'em myself. 
 - And how long have you been writing for? 
 - Huh? 
 - How long have you been writing for? 
 - Since I was four. 
 - Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions? 
 - Oh, I love open-mic. I love coming here doing open-mic, absolutely. 
 - What kind of reactions do you usually get? 
 - Usually, people are-are pretty much in agreement with what I'm saying. 
 - We overheard you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding ticket...? 
 - That's accurate. 
 - Wait, do you wanna tell us that story? 
 - Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... "Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody," I said. I says... "I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour." I says "I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket, and I'm here to and I'm here to get my fines out of the way and get the fuck to work." The judge says "You can't talk like that in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court." Then I said, If-I told the judge, "If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you." I said "Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen." I said "I'm not gonna take any shit." I said "I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket like I said." I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25 dollars up and I says "Here's my money, now I am leaving." And I left it at that. I... Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge "I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you." I said "If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would." And the judge says "Yeah, you have a point," He goes "You don't need to get loud," I said "Don't get loud?" I says "I've got every right to get loud." I says "You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it. You think you're God because you have a robe and you can put people up the god damn river for 20 years? Well you're not." And I left it at that. 
 - Did you walk away? 
 - Yes I did. I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this country's government. I just don't like it, bec- I just don't - they're sneaky, like I said, they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, They rip the people off. That's the American government for you. America *is* a third world country, and people don't recognize it, and I think that that's pretty goddamn sad, that they don't recognize their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slum. 
 - Well... Do you have any weapons? 
 - Yes, I do. I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a s- I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9 mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, um... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle... 
 - Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse? 
 - No way. Things are just gonna get worst and keep on getting worst. Like I said, America's a third world country as it is in a way and we'r-we're j- we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it stands. 
 - What do you think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003? 
 - Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even got a mind that's that... that inhumane. 
 - Are you ready for what's coming? 
 - Ready as I'll ever be. 
 - Most people aren't. 
 - There's a little saying... Dates back for generations... Go... Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window. I won't think a think a fu - I won't think a thing of it. 
 - Would you mind reciting your poem for us? 
 - Not at all, I don't see why I shouldn't - I don't see why I couldn't. There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind. It's not state of the art, it's a serious state of the mind, the muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite, a menace to society, a social disease to brainwash the mind is a social disorder . The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order watching beginnings of social decay пloating and sneering at life's disarrayб eating away at your own self esteem, pouncing on every word that you might be saying to attack someone's mind is a social disorder. The constitution, the government, martial law order, superficially smiling a shake of the hand as soon as your back is turned treason is planned when every good thing's laid to rest, by - by the governments hate, by the constitution and their lies and every time you think you're safe, and when you go to turn away you know they're sharpening all their knives, all in your mind, all in your head. Try to relate it, all in your mind, all in your head, try to escape it without a conscience they destroy. And that's a thing that they enjoy. They're a sickness that's in all of our minds, they want to sink the ship and leave, the way they laugh at you and me. You know it happens all the time but it only happens in your mind. The rats in the cellar you know who you are... Or do you? Watching beginnings of social decay...

 And-ah... Anyways, let's see what else I-I, eh... 
 It was Coney Island, they called Coney Island the playground of the world. 
 There was no place like it, in the whole world... like Coney Island when I was a youngster. 
 No place in the world like it! 
 It was so fabulous, now it's shrunk down to almost nothing, you see, eh-heh. 
 And I still remember, in my mind how things used to be. 
 And-ah you know I feel very bad. 
 But people from all over the world came here, from all over the world. 
 There was a playground they called the playground of the world, over here. 
 Anyways, so but I-ah you know. 
 I even got, when I was very small I even got lost in Coney Island. 
 But they found me. On the beach. 
 And we used to sleep on the beach here, sleep overnight. 
 They don't do it anymore... things changed. 
 They don't sleep anymore on the beach...

 The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel 
 And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides 
 And a dark wind blows 
 The government is corrupt 
 And we're on so many drugs 
 With the radio on and the curtains drawn 
 We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine 
 And the machine is bleeding to death 
 The sun has fallen down 
 And the billboards are all leering 
 And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles 
 It went like this: 
 The buildings tumbled in on themselves 
 Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble 
 And pulled out their hair 
 The skyline was beautiful on fire 
 All twisted metal stretching upwards 
 Everything washed in a thin orange haze 
 I said: "kiss me, you're beautiful - 
 These are truly the last days" 
 You grabbed my hand and we fell into it 
 Like a daydream or a fever 
 We woke up one morning and fell a little further down - 
 For sure it's the valley of death 
 I open up my wallet 
 And it's full of blood

 Chart #3 
 ...Prepared in innocence to meet our king of glory 
 And so we have this 
 You have it in your secret windows 
 And you're understanding to understand it and to bring it forth 
 It takes minute detail 
 It takes a holy life 
 It takes emotions 
 It takes dedication 
 It takes dedication 
 It takes a death 
 And only god can allow it 
 And you couldn't do it if you're not the seed of god 
 And so the path through the great corridors 
 These are corridors unto his perfection 
 That is which the prophet and the Urim and Thummim has penetrated 
 That through this great sea of blackness 
 That I penetrated through these corridors 
 And I went through that last segment 
 Where I went through these dark serpentines 
 I passed through that corridor 
 Where they sat 
 Where they are 
 And when you penetrate to the most high God 
 You will believe you are mad 
 You will believe you've gone insane 
 But I tell you, if you follow the secret window 
 And you die to the ego nature 
 You will penetrate this darkness. 
 Oh yes, there's many a man or woman 
 That's been put in the insane asylum 
 When this has happened to them 
 And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane 
 But they saw something that's real 
 And they see it when they're on drugs 
 The only thing is they see it 
 Not through the light of God, and the way I show you 
 I show you to see it through the light of God 
 And the understanding of God 
 Because when you see the face of God you will die 
 And there will be nothing left of you 
 Except the God-man, the God-woman 
 The heavenly man, the heavenly woman 
 The heavenly child 
 There will be terror under this day of night 
 There will be a song of jubilee waiting for your king 
 There will be nothing you will be looking for in this world 
 Except for your God 
 This is all a dream 
 A dream in death. 
 And so I went through that window 
 And the tower of hell and the great serpentines of the highest order 
 And I went through that when I showed you chart #3

 I don't know what to do. 
 I don'tt - I don't know what to do. 
 What kind of thing should I do? 
 Eh... I don't know. 
 Yeah? 
 What's my motivation? 
 Ooh that sounded- 
 How 'bout like that?The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel 
 And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides and a dark wind blows 
 The government is corrupt 
 And we're on so many drugs with the radio on and the curtains drawn 
 We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine 
 And the machine is bleeding to death 
 The sun has fallen down 
 And the billboards are all leering 
 And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles 
 It went like this 
 The buildings tumbled in on themselves 
 Mothers clutching babies 
 Picked through the rubble and pulled out their hair 
 The skyline was beautiful on fire 
 All twisted metal stretching upwards 
 Everything washed in a thin orange haze 
 I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful, these are truly the last days" 
 You grabbed my hand and we fell into it 
 Like a daydream or a fever 
 We woke up one morning and fell a little further down 
 For sure it's the valley of death 
 I open up my wallet and it's full of bloodLift Your. Skinny Fists, Like Antennas to Heaven...
