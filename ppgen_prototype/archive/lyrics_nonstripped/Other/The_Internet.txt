Drivin' in my car 
 Damn near cut me off 
 Now you're in the fast lane 
 So you better not slow me down 
 And I refuse to change my direction 
 So you best make up your mind 
 Before I get caught in the intersection 
 And minor traffic lights 
 We said that we'd make signals 
 Get right or get left 
 Don't seem like you're ready 
 So just get out of my way 
 Seventy in six 
 Get right or get left 
 Don't tell me you're sorry 
 Just get out my lane 
 Slowin' me down 
 Slowin' me down 
 And now we're moving faster 
 You're catching up to speed 
 And yes your car looks good to me 
 And you know it, don't try to speed off 
 Like I didn't teach you, well you know 
 Are you ready for the open road 
 We said that we'd make signals 
 Get right or get left 
 Don't seem like you're ready 
 So just get out of my way 
 Seventy in six 
 Get right or get left 
 Don't tell me you're sorry 
 Just get out my lane 
 Slowin' me down 
 Slowin' me down 
 Warning signs were there 
 But we never cared 
 So we crashed 
 And learned a lesson 
 And to take care of the damage 
 We need to admit that accidents happen 
 So if it's cool with you 
 I'll just be on my wayYou're beautiful 
 You brighten up my day 
 And when your skin touches mine 
 I get goosebumps right away 
 But you don't even know 
 Don't even know, know

 Had everything you ever wanted 
 In you 
 Planned with false hopes 
 Made your insecurities showed 
 It wasn't but you say 
 Made no difference 
 I'm hoping that some day 
 And with this change 
 She knows 
 I really hope that she knows 
 What she could be 
 She knows 
 I really hope that she knows 
 Is out to be 
 She's like the perfect daughter 
 She's never had anything given 
 Weren't careful 
 Now you have a son to hold 
 It wasn't but you say 
 Made no difference 
 I'm hoping that some day 
 And with this change 
 She knows 
 I really hope that she knows 
 What she could be 
 She knows 
 I really hope that she knows 
 Is out to beI was rollin' through the ghetto 
 In my Lincoln Continental 
 Blowin' Kush smoke out the window 
 What you think my windows tint for? 
 It go drastic 
 Measures in a tale so tragic 
 Follow formula 64 as you trail my tracks 
 Bitch, there's nothin' more pleasant than gettin' paid on point 
 Pretty bitches with gold grills just to hold my joints 
 I make 'em plead 
 As the director says scene 
 New words, don't say my name 
 I just make 'em say king 
 Four rings on that motherfuckin' wood grain wheel 
 Raw, I'm Johnny Law, but you should check my appeal 
 Once upon a time not too far back 
 There was a young wolf pack 
 That grew up in a lack 
 Syd left King 
 And Ace played Black Jack 
 Bitches be talkin' shit 
 That's how you end up smacked 
 I'm after chips 
 And if we eating then I'm after your bitch 
 Ain't no cost, just pimpin' player 
 You should be after the risk 
 We winnin' like there ain't no other way to play the game 
 All I hang around is zeros 
 Figure my checks should look the same 
 I was rollin' through the ghetto 
 In my Lincoln Continental 
 Blowin' Kush smoke out the window 
 What you think my windows tint fo'?Her state of mind is constantly changing 
 To Hell and back 
 She drives, switching lanes 
 Not knowing what she has till she knows where she's going 
 If she can just get past this traffic 
 She tries and tries to find peace of mind 
 But these days everything's in your face 
 So she stays sober in her mind 
 Blowin' smoke in the sky 
 'Cause it's her only vice 
 I wonder why 
 She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 No 
 She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 No 
 Some people seen the way she is changing 
 They don't know the struggles that she was raised with 
 So shut the fuck up 
 Just shut the fuck up 
 Stop thinking that you know everything 
 You don't and you never will so just let it go 
 And be free as long as you're kind 
 Then you can roll with the finest 
 So don't wonder why 
 She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 No 
 She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 'Cause she don't give a fuck 
 NoWe can conquer the world 
 Just you and me no one else 
 Tell me if that's cool 
 What chu wanna do 
 Ah Oh 
 Guns drawn in an all black car 
 Bustin' at all the lames 
 Who got something to say about us 
 We can rob this world blind 
 And maybe next time 
 They'll think twice 
 Before they try fuckin' with us 
 Just imagine what it be like be like 
 If you and me ruled everything 
 Would it be (Cool) 
 Or Would it be cool

 If you and me ruled everything 
 Would it be (Cool)

 Like partners in crime 
 Till the end of time 
 Guns drawn in an all black car

 Stand up when you're talking to me 
 Been drinking whiskey I don't know what I'm saying 
 But god damn I feel free 
 And I 
 Feel like I'm out my mind 
 I'm high 
 Don't pay attention to downside 
 As these days go bye, go bye 
 While we praise no lie, there's no lies 
 Never would have thought life would end up like this 
 Designer clothes, seeing things the naked eye might miss 
 The mind it wanders, I find that its harder 
 To realize what the fuck it is we doing on this earth, it's a curse 
 Excuse me mister can I get some info 
 You look pretty wise and I'm, just an ignorant mind 
 I heard that ignorance is bliss 
 So it is what it is 
 Excuse me mister can I get some info 
 You look pretty wise and I'm, just an ignorant mind 
 I heard that ignorance is bliss 
 So it is what it isThey say that every day is a struggle 
 And it takes time 
 But do they do they have a clue? 
 How do I, do I tell the truth from a lie now? 
 They try to say, hello, it's goodbye tomorrow 
 Throw a little 
 You'll be all right, you'll be all right 
 Just think if things were perfect 
 Would it be worth it if even had all? 
 So don't act like you can't take it 
 We were built to be greatless 
 I know how easy 
 (I know how easy) 
 It is to give up 
 (It is easy give up) 
 But don't let people 
 (Don't let people) 
 Hold you down 
 (Hold you down) 
 And I know sometimes 
 (I know sometimes) 
 That it will amaze you 
 (That it will amaze you) 
 But don't let it fade you 
 (Don't let it fade you) 
 Hold your ground 
 (Hold your ground) 
 Hmm 
 They say, they say, hmm 
 They say, they say, hmm 
 They say, they say, hmm 
 Why do we trust does we don't know? 
 There's no need to hide, you know what's inside 
 Why do we hate when there's love to spare? 
 Why don't we understand 
 That the only way to grow is make love 
 Just think if things were perfect 
 Would it be worth it if even had all 
 So don't act like you can't take it 
 We were built to be greatless 
 I know how easy 
 (I know how easy) 
 It is to give up

 Minded out my past 
 Damn it's so familiar 
 That they hardly ever last 
 Now they tried tellin' me 
 Messed up on my mind 
 Called and saved my pain 
 Got the ones you'll never find 
 It's all right

 Shocked up looking for a bitch to fuck.

 The way you move around me there's something seductive to it

 Yeah, yeah 
 Girl when you 
 Teasing me, pleasing me, guaranteed 
 You know that I love it when you (I love the way) 
 Dance for me, flashing me, all for free 
 That's the way I like it baby 
 It's what you do 
 Me and you should rendezvous 
 Somewhere we can meet in private 
 Your debut, time to shoot 
 Now's your cue, so 
 Won't you shadow dance for me? 
 Play it off and tell me how it feels 
 (For me) 
 If I could freeze the hands of time 
 I would stay right here with you 
 Right by my side, that'd be nice 
 The night is young, your taste is sweet 
 Lay with me until we find 
 Just what we need, what we need 
 Tell me that you love me, babe 
 Tell me that you love me, girl 
 Tell me if you love me, baby 
 Do you really love me, baby? 
 Do you really love it, girl?I see you, I see what I need 
 Upside down 'cause it's not how it seems 
 Intricacies, making believe 
 Your diary is inside of me 
 Come fly with me, way down below 
 And scream silently in the undertows 
 It's society that makes it hard to sleep 
 I close my eyes but I still see 
 The fire 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 'Cause I see you in my dreams 
 It's hard to tell whether or not I wanna know 
 I'm thinking all the time and I guess it shows 
 It's tough for us to go back in time 
 To the night before everything was fine 
 When you talked to me and I talked to you 
 We watched pedophiles on the morning news 
 And the water dripped from my faucet top 
 If I collect it all, could we get it back 
 Please 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 'Cause I see you in my dreams 
 Baby, will you forget a-'bout me 
 You're at the front of mind 
 Sitting behind my eyes all the time 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 I know that I'll never forget you girl 
 'Cause I see you in my dreamsWhen I was young I 
 Fell in love with you 
 You were my balloon 
 When you left I 
 Called upon the rain 
 Now you sit in skies of grey 
 Hoped we meet another day 
 But you up and flew away 
 I'm moving on 
 Told myself that one day I'd find you 
 My red balloon, my red balloon 
 Said don't fly away, help me fly away 
 When I get older I plan to follow you 
 In my new hot air balloon 
 When I'm bored I 
 I can get so high, high, high 
 In my champagne golden skySometimes we do things 
 Others don't understand 
 If they ask why 
 Just tell them that 
 Tellem that I love you, babe 
 Tellem that I love you, baby 
 Tellem that I love you, baby 
 Gonna tellem that I love you babe 
 (Tellem that I love you babe) 
 Tell 'em that I love you babe 
 Tell 'em that I love you, baby 
 Love you babe 
 (Love you babe) 
 I'm always gonna love you baby 
 (Always gonna love you baby)What happened to make you, to make you start to hate me? 
 I once was your heart; worth love, and you were my? everything 
 Sometimes I wonder why I still try 
 Don't say it's over 
 'Cause we both know no one's perfect, baby, I feel like this could be worth it 
 Oh 
 'Cause I haven't felt much myself lately, what I got to do to get back my lady? 
 Oh oh oh ohOpen the door 
 I look you in your face, realize I don't love you no more 
 You ask me why 
 Reoccurring thoughts of him are there 
 You'll never understand 
 You 
 You asked to be put on this level and I ignored you 
 And now I see 
 (?) 
 So the bong is where I stare 
 Girl. You know I love you, girl. You know I care 
 Girl. You know I love you, girl. You know I care 
 Frank clouds 
 Seem to like to follow me around since I lost you 
 Ask me how 
 I could leave with something so small and unsure like I didn't love you anymore 
 But you 
 Pushed me to a level of insanity, I know 
 Now, all I ask 
 Is if I ever had a chance 
 Or were we never gonna last 
 Girl. You know I love you, girl. You know I care 
 Girl. You know I love you, girl. You know I care 
 Texting me "I love you" as you were getting digged down by and old flame 
 At least you asked first when you preferred to win home games 
 Fuck it I'll let her smile, like everything that you do 
 For everything thing that you do, and it's a girl will in school 
 But as the moonlight crept in to her vacant room 
 She she's in the coup 
 Her naked, breaking curfew, nuts, and zippers too 
 See, ocean blue right after the hundredth argument 
 Dipped just as quick as you read 
 Quit the new beau and my crush hates me now 
 I'm fifty states away so ask me about your day 
 If you listen to the album I sent you 
 You shouldn't expect an answer 
 And it's 
 Shit, I'll find some new bitches I think that you can turn 
 By any chance, as it stands, that you still want me 
 I'll be in the same state you left me in 
 Alone 
 Or maybe I'll be with a bad bitch and I will check you 
 And tell you that you're nothing special 
 But you are 
 But I probably won'tLife's a mess 
 Mind's in disarray 
 So are my clothes 
 As I undress 
 And pick an outfit for this sunny day 
 'Cause it's okay 
 I attempt 
 Not to let my optimism slip away 
 'Cause it's okay 
 Cause as long as the sun is rising 
 We can get up, and brighten 
 Somebody's day 
 I'm shinin' bright as the rays 
 Inside my soul 
 So, maybe you feel it 
 Maybe you don't 
 Maybe you love it 
 Maybe you won't 
 Maybe the sunshine isn't enough 
 To heal your pain 
 So, maybe you play 
 Or maybe you fold 
 Baby you stay 
 Baby go 
 Maybe you touch me 
 I'll be afloat 
 Or maybe we'll stop somewhere down the road 
 Put on some headphones, sit at my home 
 Watchin' the sun set 
 Shed its good light on me, yeah 
 I obsess 
 Over things that shouldn't matter 
 But they do 
 And it affects me 
 In the worst possible way 
 But it's okay 
 We forget 
 What a big part all the little things can play 
 And that's okay 
 Cause as long as the sun is rising 
 We can get up, and brighten 
 Somebody's day 
 I'm shinin' bright as the rays 
 Inside my soul
