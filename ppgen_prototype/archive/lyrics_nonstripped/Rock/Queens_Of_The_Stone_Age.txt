We get some rules to follow 
 That and this, these and those 
 No one knows 
 We get these pills to swallow 
 How they stick in your throat 
 Tastes like gold 
 Oh, what you do to me 
 No one knows 
 And I realize you're mine 
 Indeed, a fool am I 
 And I realize you're mine 
 Indeed, a fool am I, I 
 I journey through the desert 
 Of the mind with no hope 
 I follow 
 I drift along the ocean 
 Dead lifeboats in the sun 
 And come undone 
 Pleasantly caving in 
 I come undone 
 And I realize you're mine 
 Indeed, a fool am I 
 And I realize you're mine 
 Indeed, a fool am I, I 
 Heaven smiles above me 
 What a gift here below 
 But no one knows 
 The gift that you give to me 
 No one knowsYou're so impossible 
 Scream and moan, it chills my soul 
 Don't wanna hear you got left behind 
 All those times you stayed up and cried 
 It's no lie, you did it to yourself 
 Like chewed-up gum under my shelf 
 Don't look surprised, you must have known all along 
 It's just another love song 
 Another love song 
 It's never easy, it's not hard 
 When you've lost your mind 
 With you, it's sleazy 
 Don't tell me your worries 
 I'm sick, I'll leave you blind 
 Now the time has come 
 To leave this love that's left you dry 
 No need to work this out now 
 'Cause you know there's no reason why 
 It's just another love song 
 Another love song 
 Another love song 
 It's just another love song 
 I never told you it would last forever 
 You can't hold this boy for long, dig it 
 By the time you read my letter 
 Baby, I'll be gone 
 You're just another love song 
 Another love song 
 Another love song 
 You're just another love song 
 You're just another love song 
 Another love song 
 Another love song 
 You're just another love songSince you're gone, I sat at home 
 Wonder why no I'll never be free 
 But the thought of you 
 Goin' with another guy 
 No, it could never be me 
 You took a ring and pawned our love away 
 What can I say, I am left behind 
 So I take a drink, another cigarette 
 I can't forget that you once were mine 
 What can I say? 
 I guess it wasn't meant to be 
 Now you're gone 
 It's just, your love is like a drug 
 It's been so long 
 Your folks have bet you gone 
 I know that you're alive inside 
 So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away 
 I just wish that you still were mineYoung, dumb, don't see a problem 
 Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum 
 Simple as this, I'm in love with the risk 
 I know what I've done, but tell me what did I miss? 
 So, please don't save something 
 Waste not, save nothing 
 Lose the halo, don't need to resist 
 I lick on my lips, and I grip on your hips 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 First thing we succumb to 
 Shall erase and undo 
 Days are unreleased, if there's no police 
 Race to slip into whatever fits you 
 Make something, make someone 
 Beg on a knee, baby, baby, please 
 Pout your bottom lip while cracking the whip 
 You know what we want is candy to cum to 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 A total eclipse 
 In the teeth of the risk 
 The tongue is a twist 
 Perpetual bliss 
 Forever midnight 
 Forever midnight 
 Forever midnight 
 Forever 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick, sick, sick 
 Don't resist 
 Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna choose) 
 Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna change) 
 Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna choose) 
 Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna change) 
 Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna choose) 
 Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take) 
 Don't resist (I don't wanna change)I been waiting 
 Waiting under things that rise in the morning 
 I been holding 
 Holding back so long 
 You can own it 
 Take it off my hands, do me a favor 
 Nothin' wasted 
 Just fingerfucked and busted up all at once 
 I'm so lost out on the highway 
 With no direction left to go 
 Everyday sit up and wonder 
 Where it was I started from 
 The more you've found 
 The less you've been around 
 The more you've found 
 The less you've been around 
 The more you've found 
 The less you've been around 
 The more you've found 
 The less you've been around 
 The more you've found 
 The less you've been aroundThe sky is falling 
 Human race that we run 
 Has left me crawling 
 Staring straight at the sun 
 All in a moment, I notice 
 Every dog has his day 
 I paid attention 
 Cost me so much to hate 
 For so long 
 I saw only wrong 
 But now to remind 
 It's a waste of time 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 I wanted something 
 Nothing blank, I don't know 
 It's hard deflecting 
 Stones are easy to throw 
 All in a moment, I noticed 
 Hours, days left behind 
 Of wasted, useless 
 Selfless, none of a kind 
 For so long 
 I saw only wrong 
 Now to remind 
 Not to go back to the low 
 That has drained my life so long 
 That has drained my life so long 
 That has drained my life so long 
 That has drained my 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are falling 
 Close your eyes and see the skies are fallingWait by the phone 
 Late, all alone 
 He can't help you 
 But I know I could 
 Three years too long 
 You know this is wrong 
 Everything scars the skin 
 Push it in, break it off 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I gave it a start 
 I stomped on your heart 
 This is the end 
 No more pictures, we ain't friends 
 It's raining in my room 
 There's blood in my spoon 
 You're out of my highchair 
 I'm out of your womb 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 Three years too long 
 You know this is wrong 
 Everything scars the skin 
 Push it in, push it in, break it off 
 I'm gonna leave 
 Gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I'm gonna leave you 
 I'm gonna leave 
 I don't need youI don't even know what I'm doing here 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Little girl walking down the street 
 Godverdomme, you gotta be with me 
 Well, I know, you know 
 Everybody, everyone, let's go 
 Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet 
 Ah, ah, woo 
 Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang 
 I'm so old, you're so young 
 I know, you know 
 Everybody, everyone, let's go 
 Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet 
 Goddamn, ah, ah, whoa 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ik denk van ja, maar nee 
 Little girl, listen what I say 
 You know, I know 
 Everybody, everyone, let's go 
 Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet 
 Whoooo 
 Ah, baby, baby, you're so sweet 
 Goddamn, ah, ah, whoaFollow trails of you to here 
 Every mile takes you my way 
 Rolling faster than we can 
 Tables turnin' all the time 
 I'm the dog at your feet 
 So we are it again 
 You're the one 
 Fucking have to wait a dime 
 Every single flingin mile 
 They're coming faster all the while 
 You're the one 
 Ain't it somethin', we're born to hulaWhen I first met her she was seventeen 
 Seventeen 
 Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match 
 Burned alive 
 We run where no one could find us 
 Girl, we outrun everyone 
 But it doesn't matter now 
 Just come and love me how 
 Like the way you used to do 
 Yeah 
 Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream? 
 Fine with either 
 Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah 
 They'll terrorize 
 If the world exploded behind us 
 I never noticed if it done 
 Let nobody dare confine us 
 I'll bury anyone who does 
 But it doesn't matter now 
 Just come and love me how 
 Like the way you used to do 
 Now 
 The way you used to do 
 My heart's a ding-a-ling, a puppet on a string 
 C'est la vie 
 So lay your hands across my beating heart 
 Love 
 If the world exploded behind us 
 I never noticed if it done 
 Let nobody dare confine us 
 I'll bury anyone who does 
 But it doesn't matter now 
 Just come and love me how 
 Like the way you used to do 
 Used to do 
 Like the way you used to do 
 Come and love me now 
 Like the way you used to do 
 Like the way you used to doI don't think I am what I was before 
 I never watched anyone die before 
 I wish I'd never left home 
 I wish I'd left it alone 
 Temptation is a disease 
 You can never do as you please 
 Your body takes over and your mind don't care 
 Never think twice what might happen out there 
 Go straight in for the ultimate sin 
 And nobody else ever seems to care 
 So I took what I thought was mine 
 And waited for a very long time 
 And I thought I knew what happened to you 
 'Cause you told me exactly what to do 
 So I did it right and stayed up all night 
 Felt like killing myself for you 
 I don't think like I did before 
 I never watched anyone die before 
 I felt like I died as well 
 The look the words the smell 
 The way you looked at me 
 As if I'd never be free 
 I remember the words like a favorite song 
 'Cause I forget the way things went wrong 
 Faked a picture of perfect health 
 Then I realised I was killing myself 
 I don't think I am what I was before 
 I never watched anyone die before 
 I dream in slow motion and I wake up screamingGot some action on the other side 
 Loose teeth in my head 
 New programs are coming in 
 So rise and take your oath 
 I wish we'd get away 
 Drink wine and screw 
 I knew someone else before 
 Looked alot like you 
 And they're gone 
 I'm gone 
 In space 
 I been programed as I said before 
 Technology 
 Just rollin', wheezin and breathin 
 Eyeballs and teeth 
 Words are weightless here on earth 
 Because they're free 
 You knew someone else before 
 Looked alot like me 
 And they're gone 
 I'm gone 
 In space 
 And they're gone 
 And I'm gone 
 In spaceGitchy, gitchy, ooh la la 
 Da doo run run, you won't get far 
 I'm machine, obsolete 
 The land of the free lobotomy 
 I wanna suck, I wanna lick 
 I wanna grind, I wanna spit 
 Tears of pleasure, tears of pain 
 They trickle down your face the same 
 It's how you look, not how you feel 
 A city of glass with no heart 
 If I had a tail 
 I'd own 
 The night 
 If I had a tail 
 I'd swat 
 The flies 
 Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la la 
 Da doo run run, you won't get far 
 Animals in the midnight zone 
 When you own the world you're always home 
 Get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves 
 Brainwashed or true believers? 
 Buy flash cars, diamond rings 
 Expensive holes to bury things 
 I'm machine, I'm obsolete 
 In the land of the free immortality 
 If I had a tail 
 I'd own 
 The night 
 If I had a tail 
 I'd swat 
 The flies 
 See me dancing on the scars 
 Can you see me dance? 
 When I have a tail 
 I will 
 Control the night 
 When I have a tail 
 I will 
 Control the night 
 When I have a tail 
 I will 
 Control the night 
 When we have a tail 
 We will 
 Control the nightShe said, "I'll throw myself away 
 They're just photos after all" 
 I can't make you hang around 
 I can't wash you off my skin 
 Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out 
 You won't remember anyway 
 I can go with the flow 
 Don't say it doesn't matter (I can go with the flow) 
 Matter anymore 
 I can go with the flow (I can go) 
 Do you believe it in your head? 
 It's so safe to play along 
 Little soldiers in a row 
 Falling in and out of love 
 Something sweet to throw away 
 I want something good to die for 
 To make it beautiful to live 
 I want a new mistake 
 Lose is more than hesitate 
 Do you believe it in your head? 
 I can go with the flow 
 Don't say it doesn't matter (I can go with the flow) 
 Matter anymore 
 I can go with the flow 
 Do you believe it in your head? (I can go with the flow) 
 Do you believe it in your head? 
 Do you believe it in your head?

 Youth 
 You could be young again 
 Anew 
 Be un-reborn again 
 Askew 
 Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally 
 Buried so close to the fountain of youth you can almost reach

 You could be young again 
 Anew 
 Be un-reborn again 
 Right where the map ends, is where its hid 
 Under the X is where it lives 
 Askew 
 Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally 
 Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach 
 Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally 
 Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach 
 (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally) 
 I had a vision as clear as day 
 (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach) 
 Delusions of grandeur in our DNA 
 (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally) 
 Every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth 
 (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach) 
 Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth 
 Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh 
 Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh 
 Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh-uhuh-uhai 
 Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh 
 There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain 
 You can drink from the water before it's been drained away 
 Every drop like an ocean, every moment undone 
 Implosions of beauty back to where we begun 
 There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain 
 Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth 
 Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh 
 Screaming, mm-hm, mm-hm, hm-hm, hmmm-hmmm-hmmmWhere have you gone again, my sweet? 
 Everybody wants to know 
 Where have you gone again, my sweet? 
 Everybody wants to know 
 Where you gone? 
 Where you gone? 
 I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street 
 Waitin', when you comin' home? 
 I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street 
 Waitin', when you comin' home? 
 Gone so long, oh 
 Where you gone? 
 A long slow goodbye 
 A long slow goodbye 
 In every voice I hear you speak 
 Waitin' by the telephone 
 I close my eyes, I just can't sleep 
 Roll and tumble all night long 
 All night long 
 Where you gone? 
 A long slow goodbye 
 A long slow goodbye 
 A long slow goodbye 
 A long slow goodbye 
 I close my eyes, I just can't sleep 
 Where have you gone again, my sweet? 
 A long slow goodbye 
 A long slow goodbye

 Goodbye 
 Goodbye

 There's velvet eyes in Mexico 
 Just a fall away 
 And all she said was true 
 Speak in tongues, speak in lies 
 Drooling livers, born to die 
 It's a wonder that 
 Those guns don't point at you 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "You won't 
 Live forever" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "You won't 
 Live forever" 
 Point and shoot 
 I know just what you mean 
 In a world that's full of shit 
 And gasoline, baby 
 One dog's dead, one's on the phone 
 Just leave a lung or leave it alone 
 It's that same old song again 
 I hate it 'cause it's true 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "You won't 
 Live forever" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "Go on" 
 Keep sayin', "You won't 
 Live forever"Well, I've got a secret I cannot say 
 Blame all the movement to give it away 
 You've got something that I understand 
 Hold it in tightly, caught on command 
 Leap of faith, do you doubt 
 Cut you in, I just cut you out 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Look for reflections in your face 
 Canine devotion, time can't erase 
 Out on the corner, or locked in your room 
 I never believe them and I never assume 
 Stuck in belief, there is a lie 
 Promise is promise, an eye for an eye 
 We've got something to reveal 
 No one can know how we feel 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell 
 I think you already know 
 How far I'd go not to say 
 You know the art isn't gone 
 And I'm taking my song to the grave 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tell anyone 
 Whatever you do 
 Don't tellTwo glass eyes 
 I fucking tell you lies 
 I'm on the side of the road 
 You're all gonna fucking die 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot 
 Pow, pow 
 Pow 
 Oh 
 Fuck this world 
 Well, fuck you, too 
 I'll fucking kill your best friend 
 What you fucking gonna do, okay 
 Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, pow 
 Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot 
 Pow 
 Ah, pow 
 Whoo, pow 
 Ah, pow 
 Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, powEveryone it seems 
 Has somewhere to go 
 And the faster the world spins 
 The shorter the lights will glow 
 And I'm swimming in the night 
 Chasing down the moon 
 The deeper in the water 
 The more I long for you 
 Most of what you see, my dear 
 Is purely for show 
 Because not everything that goes around 
 Comes back around, you know 
 Holding on too long is just 
 A fear of letting go 
 Because not everything that goes around 
 Comes back around, you know 
 One thing that is clear 
 It's all down hill 
 From here 
 The love line in your hand 
 Cleverly disguised 
 All the promises of stone 
 Crumble in the night 
 Most of what you see, my dear 
 Is worth letting go 
 Because not everything that goes around 
 Comes back around, you know 
 Holding on too long is just 
 A fear of what to show 
 Because not everything that goes around 
 Comes back around, you know 
 Not everything that goes around 
 Comes back around, you know 
 One thing that is clear 
 It's all down hill 
 From here, oohI play a game 'til I'm dead 
 Or on a magazine 
 I wanna look like I'm dead 
 Dancing on a string 
 I eat the food when it's there 
 Make a mess of things 
 Get that look everywhere 
 But keep that look off my face 
 Everybody else wanna fall in love 
 There's no room for love in a modern sky 
 Living in the era vulgaris 
 Just drool in the dark 
 As you stare at the lights 
 From a crumbling tower I see everything 
 London, Tokyo, New York City 
 There's no love any place 
 Everybody else wanna fall in love 
 There's no room for love in a modern sky 
 Living in the era vulgaris 
 Just drool in the dark 
 As you stare at the lights 
 All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition 
 Over, over left with who we are 
 Did you tell anyone? 
 Did you tell any place? 
 Everybody else wanna fall in love 
 There's no room for love in a modern sky 
 Living in the era vulgaris 
 Just drool in the dark 
 As you stare at the lights 
 Living in the era vulgaris 
 Just drool in the dark 
 As you stare at the lights 
 Just stare at the lightsHolding hands 
 Skipping like a stone 
 On our way 
 To see what we have done 
 The first to speak 
 Is the first to lie 
 The children cross 
 Their hearts and hope to die 
 Bite your tongue 
 Swear to keep 
 Your mouth shut 
 Ask yourself 
 "Will I burn in hell?" 
 Then write it down 
 And cast it in the well 
 There they are 
 The mob, it cries for blood 
 To twist the tale 
 Into firewood 
 Fan the flames 
 With a little lie 
 Then turn your cheek 
 Until the fire dies 
 The skin, it peels 
 Like the truth, away 
 What it was 
 I will never say 
 Bite your tongue 
 Swear to keep 
 Keep your mouth shut 
 Make up something 
 Make up something good 
 Holding hands 
 Skipping like a stone 
 Burn the witch 
 Burn to ash and bone 
 Burn the witch 
 Burn to ash and bone 
 Burn the witch 
 Burn to ash and boneI slipped 
 Didn't mean, didn't mean to do it that way 
 But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow (shit) 
 I'm gone today 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh-oh-oh yeah 
 Come, let's play along 
 And let each other lose 
 A win would cause an alarm 
 Don't matter to me, don't matter to you 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh-oh-oh yeah 
 I could keep you all for myself 
 I know you gotta be free 
 So free yourself 
 I could keep you all for myself 
 I know you gotta be free 
 So free yourself 
 A self-inflicted wound 
 Your gift, impeccable aim 
 Can really clear a room 
 All the bodies piled up in your way 
 Oh yeah (it hurts) 
 So bad (and it must) 
 Oh-oh-oh yeah 
 I could keep you all for myself 
 I know you gotta be free 
 So free yourself 
 I could keep you all for myself 
 I know you gotta be free 
 To kill yourselfI seen you go 
 Through a park in a haze 
 And I don't listen 
 For traffic going the same way 
 A simple system 
 Yeah 
 I string 'em up, I cut 'em down 
 And dare I say 
 Do-do do do do x3 
 A perfect vision 
 Such simple ways to let you know 
 Free range humans 
 All cooped up, naked clone 
 Is playing lame 
 Yeah 
 I string 'em up, I cut 'em down 
 And dare I say 
 Do-do do do do x3I was born in the desert, May 17 in '73 
 When the needle hit the groove 
 I commence to moving 
 I was chasing what's calling me 
 Oh, feet don't fail me now 
 One foot in the gutter, one in the clouds 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I just gotta move on 
 Life is hard, that's why no one survives 
 I'm much older than I thought I'd be 
 Feel like a fool, just like a dancing fool, yeah 
 Footloose and fancy free 
 Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now 
 Stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I just gotta move on 
 Push myself, the breaking point 
 It's all I know to do except for why? 
 I chase break lights and bust ad nauseam 
 Driven by feelings I cannot hide 
 To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies 
 On and on and on and on and 
 Me and my gang come to bust you loose 
 We move with an urgency 
 Between pleasure and agony, on a runaway line 
 That's the sound that's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's calling me 
 It's 
 Time to go, regret it later 
 We're gonna take it as it comes 
 Future tense meets middle finger 
 We take the long way home 
 Oh, feet don't fail me now 
 Do whatcha gotta do, oh do it now 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 I just gotta move onI'm going out west where the wind blows tall 
 Cause Tony Franciosa used to date my ma' 
 They got some money out there; they're givin' it away 
 I'm gonna do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid 
 Do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid 
 Little brown sausages lying in the sand 
 I ain't no extra baby, I'm a leading man 
 My parole officer will be proud of me 
 With my Olds 88 
 And the Devil on a leash 
 With my Olds 88 
 And the Devil on a leash 
 I know karate, voodoo too 
 I'm gonna make myself available to you 
 I don't need no makeup 
 I got real scars 
 I got hair on my chest 
 N'I look good without a shirt on 
 Well, I won't loose my composure in a high-speed chase 
 My friends say I'm ugly, I've got a masculine face 
 I got some drag-strip courage 
 I can really drive a bed 
 I'm gonna change my name To Hannibal 
 Or maybe just Rex 
 Change my name To Hannibal 
 Or maybe just Rex 
 I know karate, voodoo too 
 I'm gonna make myself available to you 
 I don't need no makeup 
 I got real scars 
 I got hair on my chest 
 I look good without a shirt on 
 Drive all night, get some speed 
 I'm gonna wait for the sun to shine down on me 
 I got a hole in my roof 
 The shape of a heart 
 And I'm going out west 
 Where they appreciate me 
 Going out west 
 Where they appreciate me 
 Going out west 
 Going out west 
 Gone...Your heart is like a fortress 
 Keep your feelings locked away 
 Is it easier? 
 Does it make you feel safe? 
 You wander through the darkness 
 Of wilderness behind your eyes 
 I know you're afraid 
 But you gotta move on 
 Every fortress falls 
 It is not the end 
 It ain't if you fall 
 But how you rise that says 
 Who you really are 
 So get up and come through 
 If ever your fortress caves 
 You're always safe 
 I believe I know you 
 Yet, I don't truly know myself 
 I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt 
 I don't want to fail you so 
 I tell you the awful truth 
 Everyone faces darkness on their own 
 As I have done, so will you 
 Every fortress falls 
 It is not the end 
 It ain't if you fall 
 But how you rise that says 
 Who you really are 
 So get up and go through 
 If ever your fortress caves 
 You're always safe in mine 
 The Earth spins 'round the sun 
 And behold 
 Everything happens 
 Every night that falls prey to sunrise 
 If your fortress is under siege 
 You can always run for me 
 If your fortress is under siege 
 You can always run 
 Every fortress falls 
 It is not the end 
 It ain't if you fall 
 But how you rise that says 
 Who you really are 
 So get up and go through 
 If ever your fortress caves 
 You're always safe in mine 
 If ever your fortress caves 
 You're always safe in mine 
 If ever your fortress caves 
 You're always safe in mine 
 Come on through 
 Come on throughThe kid who wants some of the pretties in life 
 Tried shortcuts those are myths despite 
 The first hands, the backhands, the bruises, the bites 
 The painful spoonful the hustle invites 
 Speak my name and I'll appear 
 Right here 
 Hideaway 
 Hideaway 
 I'm all dressed up, no one left to blow 
 Addiction to friction leaves you raw 
 Left with the taste of flesh and bone 
 It's a beautiful day in the USA 
 Eye requires a pupil and I'm sure 
 It's yours 
 Hideaway 
 Hideaway 
 You'll stay fast and lonely 
 Never ever need to run and hide from me 
 New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms 
 You'll feel love 
 Innocence is what you lose 
 Like keys and dreams and old tattoos 
 With one quick twist love turns to scar 
 Cruising the bruises in my car 
 Catch the keys and take the wheel and drive 
 For a while 
 Hideaway 
 Hideaway 
 You'll stay fast and lonely 
 Never ever need to run and hide from me 
 New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms 
 You owe me everything 
 You owe me everything 
 You'll feel love 
 You'll feel love 
 Hold my hand 
 You'll feel love 
 You'll feel love 
 You'll feel love 
 Who needs love?Fast approaching monsters 
 Marching in a row 
 Grab what slips your mind and what your 
 Memory won't hold 
 Run, darling, run 
 I'll stall them if I can 
 You'll escape and I'll be left 
 Rotting on the vine 
 Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Run, darling, run 
 I'll stall them if I can 
 You'll escape and I'll be left 
 Rotting on the vine 
 Avert the childrens eyes 
 Forget, left untold 
 Don't look back to see the blood 
 River in the road 
 Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Get sweet revenge with my blood 
 River in the roadThe mule want it 
 The mule want it Sunday 
 He'll eat it 
 He'll eat it one day 
 How long, long, long 
 Do I wait, wait 
 Be the mule that you gotta be, yeah 
 Underwater 
 Underwater one day 
 Gonna sink it 
 Make 'em think it's too late 
 For your love, love, love 
 For your love, love, love 
 Be the mule that you gotta beI fall over and over and over 
 Over, oh, I want you 
 I get in, I get in, I get in 
 You're the only one I'm into 
 You and me 
 Fit so tight 
 I go lower and lower and lower 
 Lower, living easy 
 I don't know how long I got 
 Till it's over 
 You and me 
 Fit so tight 
 Can you do it again? 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Can you do it again? 
 All the way, all the way, all the way 
 There's nowhere left we can be 
 I'm into what you do 
 But I leave you nowhere 
 You and me 
 Fit so tight 
 All we need 
 Is one more time 
 Can you do it again? 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Can you do it again? 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Can you do it again? 
 Only get to live one life 
 Won't pretend you're only mine 
 Wherever you'll go 
 Wherever you'll find a way 
 So do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it againMy generation's for sale, beats a steady job 
 How much have you got? 
 My generation don't trust no one, it's hard to blame 
 Not even ourselves 
 The thing that's real for us is fortune and fame 
 All the rest seems like work 
 It's just like diamonds in shit 
 I'm high class, I'm a whore, actually both 
 Basically I'm a pro 
 We've all got our own style of baggage 
 Why hump it yourself? 
 You've made me an offer that I can refuse 
 'Cause either way I get screwed 
 Counter proposal, I go home and jerk off 
 It's truly a lie 
 I counterfeit myself 
 It's truly a lie 
 I counterfeit myself 
 You don't own, you don't own 
 You don't own, you don't own 
 You don't own what none can buy 
 You don't own, you don't own 
 Neither do I 
 High and mighty you say selling 
 Out is a shame, is that the name 
 Of your book, push a silver spoon 
 In your ass, no more holding us 
 Down, down, dog, down, mutt 
 Nice mutt 
 You're insulted, you can't be bought or sold 
 Translation: offer too low 
 You don't know what you're worth, it isn't much 
 My piano is for sale 
 How many times must I sell myself 
 Before my pieces are gone? 
 I'm one of a kind, I'm designer 
 Never again will I repeat myself 
 Enough is never enough 
 Never again will I repeat myself 
 It used to be the plan was screwing 
 The man, now it's "Have sex with the 
 Man" after he buys you ".com" 
 For sale at a low, low price 
 It's truly a lie 
 I counterfeit myself 
 It's truly a lie 
 I counterfeit myself 
 You don't own, You don't own 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own what none can buy 
 You don't own, you don't own 
 What none can buy 
 Neither do IHey sister, why you all alone? 
 I'm standin' out your window 
 Hey little sister, can I come inside, dear? 
 I wanna show you all my love 
 I wanna be the only one 
 I know you like nobody ever, baby 
 Little sister, can't you find another way? 
 No more livin' life behind a shadow 
 Little sister, can't you find another way? 
 No more livin' life behind a shadow 
 You whisper secrets in my ear 
 Slowly dancin', cheek to cheek 
 Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby 
 They say I'll only do you wrong 
 We come together 'cause I understand 
 Just who you really are, yeah, baby 
 Little sister, can't you find another way? 
 No more livin' life behind a shadow 
 Little sister, can't you find another way? 
 No more livin' life behind a shadowYou know why 
 They call and just let it ring 
 No reply 
 The door was open, I swear 
 Ain't no use in pickin' up 
 You know why 
 It's all my head, I know 
 So they tell me so 
 Until my head explodes 
 Into my head it goes 
 Tastes so good 
 Oh, but I knew it would 
 Tastes so good 
 Burn like a match house 
 Medicate just to make you soft 
 Love is blind 
 Catch and release me 
 What the hell were they thinking of 
 You know why 
 It's all my head, I know 
 So they tell me so 
 Until my head explodes 
 Into my head it goesWanna see my past in flames 
 Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't fussed 
 Where I was born, no escape 
 There ain't even no good bad drugs 
 In the city is it true 
 If you don't, you act like you do? 
 Feast of fools, I can't wait 
 Give 'em a taste of my misfit love 
 Complicate, incarcerate 
 Feel my heart wake up 
 Ain't born to lose, baby 
 I'm born to win 
 I'm so goddamn sick, baby, it's a sin 
 It's a sin 
 Transforming (thrill, I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill) 
 Is becoming (I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill) 
 Transforming (I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill) 
 Is becoming (I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill) 
 On me 
 Do me first, do your worst 
 Gimme what I want some of 
 One track mind, no time to waste 
 Sidewalk feel me strut so good 
 Gutter, don't you forget this face 
 Let 'em taste my misfit love 
 I'll show you all my dirty tricks 
 Then show 'em again, I'm so proud of 'em 
 It's cruel to be constantly 
 Feel my heart play dumb 
 Ain't born to lose, baby 
 I'm born to win 
 Yeah, I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin 
 It's a sin 
 Just a dead man walking through the dead of night 
 And if you are going anywhere tonight 
 Just a dead end walking through the dead of night 
 And if you are going, can I get a ride? 
 Just a dead man walking through the dead of night 
 It's impossible to wait until the light 
 'Cause I'm already gone 
 If you bet on me, you've won 
 'Cause I'm already gone 
 If you bet on me, you've won 
 'Cause I'm already gone 
 If you bet on me, you've won 
 'Cause I'm already gone 
 If you bet on me, you've wonHey, little sister, what have you done? 
 Hey, little sister, who's the only one? 
 Hey, little sister, who's your Superman? 
 Hey, little sister, who's the one you want? 
 Hey, little sister, shotgun! 
 It's a nice day to start again 
 It's a nice day for a white wedding 
 It's a nice day to start again 
 Hey, little sister, what have you done? (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 Hey, little sister, who's the only one? (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 I've been away for so long (So long) 
 I've been away for so long (So long) 
 I let you go for so long 
 It's a nice day to start again 
 C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding 
 It's a nice day to start again, ow! 
 There is nothing fair in this world, baby 
 There is nothing safe in this world 
 And there's nothing sure in this world 
 And there's nothing pure in this world 
 Look for something left in this world 
 Start again 
 C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding, wow! 
 It's a nice day to start again 
 It's a nice day to start again 
 It's a nice day to start againIt's late enough to go drivin' 
 And see what's mine 
 Life's the study of dying 
 How to do it right 
 If you're a holy roller 
 If you're bent on the loose 
 If you're hangin' around 
 I'm holdin' the noose 
 Come a little bit closer 
 And get untied 
 In a hearse rollin' over 
 Just a track in the line, fuck it 
 Come on, let's go drivin' 
 Come on, let's take a little ride 
 Life's the study of dying 
 How to do it rightI want God to come 
 And take me home 
 'Cause I'm all alone 
 In this crowd 
 Who are you to me? 
 Who am I supposed to be? 
 Not exactly sure 
 Anymore 
 Where's this going to? 
 Can I follow through? 
 Or just follow you 
 For a while? 
 Does anyone ever get this right? 
 I feel no love 
 Ain't no confusion here 
 It is as I feared 
 The illusion that you feel 
 Is real 
 To be vulnerable 
 Is needed most of all 
 If you intend to truly fall 
 Apart 
 You think the worst of all 
 Is far behind 
 The Vampyre 
 Of time and memories 
 Has died 
 I survived 
 I speak, I breathe 
 I'm incomplete 
 I'm alive 
 Hooray 
 You're wrong again 
 'Cause I feel no love 
 Does anyone ever get this right? 
 Does anyone ever get this right? 
 I feel no love 
 I feel no loveIt's the cruelest joke to play 
 I'm so high I run in place 
 Only a line we separate 
 So 
 I keep on playin' our favorite song 
 I turn it up, while you're gone 
 It's all I've got when you're in my head 
 And you're in my head, so I need it 
 You're the only thing I've got 
 That I can't seem to get enough 
 We collide for one embrace 
 So 
 I keep on playin' our favorite song 
 I turn it up, while you're gone 
 It's all I've got when you're in my head 
 And you're in my head, so I need it 
 I keep on playin' our favorite song 
 I turn it up, while you're gone 
 It's all I've got when you're in my head 
 And you're in my head, so I need it 
 My radio, I can't wait forever 
 I keep on playin' our favorite song 
 I turn it up, while you're gone 
 It's all I've got when you're in my head 
 And you're in my head, so I need it 
 I keep on playin' our favorite song 
 I turn it up, while you're gone 
 It's all I've got when you're in my head 
 And you're in my head, so I need it 
 I need it 
 I need it 
 I need it nowEveryday I wake up 
 Feeling this way 
 I take it downtown 
 With all the action going down 
 I strike a match, strike a match, cook it up 
 (My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life) 
 I feel so fucking sick (my life, your life) 
 On the bathroom floor 
 Try to get out and get right 
 Hustling little girls 
 Cheating little boys, yeah 
 Gotta get out 
 Gotta get out and get right 
 Gotta get out 
 I gotta get out no more 
 No more, no more 
 (My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life) 
 On the bathroom floor (my life) 
 And I'm feeling so sick (your life) 
 No more 
 (High life, low life) 
 (High life, low life) 
 (High life, low life) 
 (My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life) 
 And I feel so sick (my life) 
 No, no more (your life)Got guns, do you wanna 
 Take aim at each other? 
 Scratch the itch, give the finger 'cause we don't care 
 Anyway 
 Got knives, have you seen 'em? 
 In your back's where we keep 'em 
 And you're never gonna reach 'em, now that sounds fair 
 Oh, this is bound to be good 
 You can't but you thought that you could 
 Boiling it down 
 Little king, little crown 
 Oh 'you give and you give,' why don't you just give in? 
 Come on, take it with a smile 
 Hit the bottle for a while 
 You can beg, you can plead, it won't change a thing 
 Oh, this is bound to be good 
 You can't but you thought that you could 
 Oh, how can you win 
 Against yourself again? 
 How you like your position? 
 You ain't Robert Mitchum 
 You're 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag 
 Oh, this is bound to be good 
 You can't but you thought that you could 
 Oh, how can you win 
 Against yourself again? 
 Yeah, ooh yeah 
 Ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 Ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 OohI sat by the ocean 
 And drank a potion, baby, to erase you 
 Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you 
 There ain't no use in crying 
 It doesn't change anything, so baby, what good does it do? 
 Your friends they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to 
 Imagine I'd be your one and only 
 Instead I'm the lonely one 
 You, me 
 And a lie 
 Silence is closer 
 We're passing ships in the night 
 There's nowhere to run away 
 Said, "Boy if you want love, you'll have to go 
 And find it with someone new" 
 "Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?" 
 Lies are a funny thing 
 They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you 
 Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view 
 Imagine I'd be your one and only 
 Instead I'm the lonely one 
 You, me 
 And a lie 
 Silence is closer 
 We're passing ships in the night 
 You, me 
 And a lie 
 Silence is closer 
 We're passing ships in the night 
 Into the light 
 Left with nowhere to hide 
 Closer and closer 
 We're crashing ships in the nightWho'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next in line for heartache? 
 Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 For you? 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next to watch your love fade? 
 All your affections finally fade away. 
 There'll be no use in sighing. 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 For you? 
 One day you'll find out when I'm gone, 
 I was the best one you had, 
 I was the one who gave you love. 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next in line for heartaches? 
 Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? 
 There'll be no use in sighing. 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 For you? 
 One day you'll find out when I'm gone, 
 I was the best one you had, 
 I was the one who gave you love. 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next in line for heartaches? 
 Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 Who'll be the next in line? 
 For you? 
 For you?When I was young we used to play the game of hide and seek 
 Someone go hide, I count to ten 
 You probably never played, instead you talk a game of sheep 
 A skill you almost do perfect 
 Run, pig, run 
 Here I come 
 Wooh, ah, wooh, ah 
 Wooh, ah 
 I am no saint and make no claims to being in the right 
 It's just for now, I am wrong-less 
 You're probably wondering with what to do this has with you 
 I wanna play the game you missed 
 Run, pig, run 
 Here I come 
 There is no safe place, there is no safe place 
 There is no safe place to hide 
 Wooh, ah, wooh, ah 
 Wooh, ahWhen I was a little boy 
 I looked under the stairs 
 The king and the pawns 
 Were caught unawares 
 Standing in the shadows 
 A whisperer to be 
 Just fishing in the darkness 
 Of possibilities 
 Just 
 Look 
 At you run 
 Yeah 
 Look at you run 
 Yeah 
 Ooh 
 Look at you run 
 Among such style and grace 
 Our highest hopes 
 None standing still 
 The running joke 
 Where goes the warm embrace it fades 
 Without return 
 That lives to slip through fingertips and burn 
 Just 
 Look 
 At you run 
 Ooh 
 Look at you run 
 Ooh 
 Look at you run 
 Ooh 
 Look at you runAu revoir, adieu, goodnight 
 I'm too wrong to get right 
 But I can't wait forever 
 I've always been alone, a fool believes he's clever 
 Don't you wanna go into the hollow? 
 I won't go alone, aren't you gonna follow? 
 Ah 
 I live behind my eyes 
 Be sure to keep the surprise 
 I break what I have borrowed 
 That's why I always go alone into tomorrow 
 Don't you wanna go into the hollow? 
 I won't go alone, aren't you gonna follow? 
 Into the hollow 
 Into the hollowYour head's like a haunted house 
 A tutti frutti written over the caption 
 Miss diagnosis a-with-a the mostest 
 Cue the evil smile 
 Desperation can led to madness 
 De-de-degradation is a must 
 The A, B, C's of leprosy 
 Need a hand? Take mine 
 We're subleem, sublime 
 Fake apologize 
 Fucks in short supply 
 Too late, too slick, too young 
 Gag the bag reflex, spoken tongues 
 Séance, say what? 
 Say man, don't even think about it 
 Push the pest-aside 
 Xanadu's and xanadont's 
 Edumacate me, copulate me 
 A dirty trick and it's making me sick, ugh 
 (You okay?) I'm fine 
 Let's go! Is my sign 
 We're subleem, sublime 
 G-g-g-goddamn crime 
 Tonight 
 I'm gonna put up a fight 
 I'm gonna get a reaction 
 That I like 
 Burn the days 
 I reject your displays 
 I demand satisfaction 
 Or the knife 
 To trick the light fantastic, one takes wire on the shins 
 Petty disguises worn like skins, a distinction 
 Nice 
 Drink the Kool-Aid and swallow the pill 
 You say that you don't and you won't, but you will 
 Busted 
 Your head's like a haunted house 
 Peeping at your mumbo jumbo 
 Outta sight, going bump in the night 
 Screwacide 
 With posterier so superior 
 Ain't in the race for second place 
 Circumstances in my pants 
 Is calling for action 
 Girl, I'll blow your mind 
 Then you will blow mine 
 We're subleem, sublime 
 Goin' for a ride 
 HeyYou're a headcase with a smile 
 Can't stop to make up your mind 
 Education is so lame (so lame) 
 When you bitch and you moan 
 You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (hey) 
 You're a truth freak with a lie 
 The situation is so strange 
 It's a TV show (click) 
 In a hotel on the phone 
 You're gonna leave me, I should have known (should have known) 
 And I was thinkin', it's so sad 
 I didn't want you to go 
 Don't wanna follow the laws of man (yes, sir) 
 Bloody apron, leg of lamb 
 It's so hard to win 
 When there's so much to lose 
 Infiltrate the walls that are caving in 
 It ain't a bad thing 
 This ain't reality 
 Infiltrate the walls that are caving in 
 It ain't a bad thing 
 Think of it as natural 
 Second Avenue, raising Cain 
 I'm a sinner, ring my bell (hey man) 
 I'll tell you what, I'd get up 
 If I knew I fellI'm gonna suture up my future 
 I ain't jaded, I just hate it 
 See, I been down too long, it's kinda hard to explain 
 Burned and buried all I carried 
 All my evil through a needle 
 As if pulled through the eye, what was and what will, they're all gone 
 Don't sweat it 
 Thread it to forget it 
 To feel like you're already gone 
 To the rest of, the rest of 
 The life that you've got 
 Take a picture 
 And bury it all away 
 Bury it all away 
 Try to fake it, I just can't take it 
 I don't care if it hurts, just so long as it's real 
 I won't waste it, I turn to face it 
 I'd sharpen the knife, then used it to bone, made it dull 
 Tried explaining, done explaining 
 Got caught in the plaid, all this talking at once 
 I've been giving my love away to the things that tear it apart 
 I'm gonna suture up my future 
 Thread it to forget it 
 To feel like you're already gone 
 To the rest of, the rest of 
 The life that you've got 
 Tie the loose ends 
 And bury it all away 
 It's like this 
 It's like thisIf it gets you down, well, then I'll take it 
 If it gets you up, well, I don't want it 
 It let you down so broken-hearted 
 If it gets you down, well, then I want it 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 It was nothing at all 
 So I blow my mind to make it lazy 
 Those long, long days with no escaping 
 I hold the wheel, then let it go, don't wanna stop, don't wanna know 
 If it gets you down, well, just don't blame me 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 If only, only 
 It was nothing at allLie 
 Lie to my face 
 Tell me it ain't nothing 
 That's what I wanna hear 
 Take 
 The lie to the grave 
 That's what an old friend told me 
 Look what it did for him 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say? 
 So why tell it? 
 If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in 
 Heaven now 
 Run 
 You'll never escape 
 You see, you'll go nowhere 
 Based on who you appear 
 Broke 
 Laid to waste 
 Turn into sweet nothings 
 Kiss you goodbye 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say? 
 So why tell it? 
 If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in 
 Heaven now 
 I keep going over and over again 
 The neverending places I've never been 
 No one's catching on, calling my bluff 
 The Devil made me, only we never met 
 What'd you do? 
 Say it with a smile, boy 
 Making us all forget 
 What'd you do? 
 Say it with a smile, boy 
 Making us all forget 
 Making us all forget 
 Making us all forget 
 NOTE: The pre-version of the song, which is the one featured in the aforementioned games, has idential lyrics up until the line "The Devil made me, only we never met". The final verse in this version is as follows: 
 The truth 
 Has always had three sides 
 Mine, yours and how it went 
 The truth 
 Has always been a lie 
 I'm never telling it 
 Making us all forget 
 Making us all forget 
 Swear to GodSaw you lying down there on the marble slab 
 The best trip that I've ever had 
 High up in a jet plane, pass it around 
 My drink's on empty, need another round 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 Is this the best that you can do? 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 When we arrive in the middle of nowhere 
 Don't act like you know, I been here so many times 
 I never seen you before 
 But now that I have, I don't wanna see you no more 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 Is this the best that you can do? 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 Ah-ah, auto pilot, no control 
 Ah-ah, ah 
 Ah-ah, auto pilot, no control 
 Ah-ah, ah 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 High up in a jet plane with you 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 Is this the best that you can do? 
 I wanna fly, wanna ride with you 
 High up in a jet plane with youIf time itself was his demeanor 
 There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer 
 Of sunlight landin' on the street 
 Sunsuit girls must be discreet 
 Sunsuit girls must be discreet 
 Nursing their fathers locked inside 
 They masqueraded as his bride 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 But there's somethin' in your eyes 
 That says maybe that's never 
 Never say never 
 Slumped by the courthouse 
 With windburned skin 
 That man could give a fuck 
 About the grin on your face 
 As you walk by, randy as a goat 
 He's sleepin' on papers 
 When he'd be warm in your coat 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 But there's somethin' in your eyes 
 That says maybe that's never 
 Never say never 
 There's no easy way to lose your sight 
 On the street, on the stairs 
 Who's on your flight 
 Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin 
 But he's got her and she's got him 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 I might like you better if we slept together 
 But there's somethin' in your eyes 
 That says maybe that's never 
 Never say never 
 Never say never 
 Never say never 
 Never say never 
 Never say neverWould you like our way home? 
 I bleed my own 
 Round the hangin' tree 
 Swayin' in the breeze 
 In the summer sun 
 As we two are one 
 Round the hangin' tree 
 Swayin' in the breeze 
 In the summer sun 
 As we two are one 
 Swayin' 
 Can you see under my thumb? 
 There you are 
 Round the hangin' tree 
 Swayin' in the breeze 
 In the summer sun 
 As we two are one

 Up into the night sky they blast 
 Through the universe the engines whine 
 Could it be the end of man and time? 
 Back on earth the flame of life burns low 
 Everywhere is misery and woe 
 Pollution kills the air, the land and sea 
 Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah 
 Rocket engines burning fuel so fast 
 Up into the black sky so vast 
 Burning metal through the atmosphere 
 Earth remains in worry, hate and fear 
 With the hateful battles raging on 
 Rockets flying to the glowing sun 
 Through the empires of eternal void 
 Freedom from the final suicide 
 Freedom fighters sent out to the sun 
 Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution 
 Leave the earth to all its sin and hate 
 Find another world where freedom waits, yeah 
 Past the stars in fields of ancient void 
 Through the shields of darkness where they find 
 Love upon a land a world unknown 
 Where the sons of freedom make their home 
 Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves 
 Leave them to their future in the grave 
 Make a home where love is there to stay 
 Peace and happiness in everydayK-L-O-N, Los Angeles, KLONE Radio. We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else. 
 Hey, all right, it's Kip Kasper, KLONE Radio, LA's infinite repeat. How we feelin' out there? How's your drive-time commute? I need a saga. What's the saga? It's Songs for the Deaf. You can't even hear it!

 Or am I walking alone? 
 When I turned around and found that you'd gone before 
 The first rain could fall 
 It seems every single time I was bleeding 
 Broken promises that never came true 
 Well, it ain't so long before the dawn 
 When the sun is gone so are 
 Well, so are you 
 So what's it gonna take 
 To get you back in bed? 
 Gossip, frauds and snakes 
 They're just our best 
 Fairweather friends (fairweather friends) 
 Fairweather Friends (fairweather friends) 
 One day when we're far away 
 From everything that hurts 
 Drink wine and screw is all we'll do 
 Every day 
 So what's it gonna take 
 To get you back in bed? 
 Gossip, frauds and snakes 
 They're just our best 
 Fairweather Friends (fairweather friends) 
 And though the hour's late 
 Don't let 'em in your head (fairweather friends) 
 Gonna pray for rain again and again 
 Fairweather friends 
 Fairweather friends (fairweather friends) 
 Fairwea - I don't give a shit about them anyhowCozied up to the toilet 
 Face stuck to the floor 
 I met expectations 
 That I was tryin' to ignore 
 Job had such patience 
 I wonder 
 What's that like? 
 A hundred thousand million 
 But that's what you like 
 So I was thinkin' 
 So these cities are sprouting 
 Like a spit in the eye 
 And this world isn't waiting 
 It's just passing me by 
 I just peak in the window 
 Lookin' inside 
 The butcher's got a fork in your face 
 And I'm standing in line 
 While I was singin'It's hanging above you and it's over 
 It's over your head 
 Hovering slowly I hear words 
 Too and I totally agree 
 It ain't just you and me 
 Since then you've been looking at me 
 Like I been on your mind 
 Everything would have been 
 Don't take it like we're taking it home 
 It's over your head 
 It's over my headMake you into dark 
 Straight into your heart 
 Sorry all you are 
 I don't really care 
 I know you are 
 Robots, robots, brainwashed babies 
 Blood from a leech, spoken rabies 
 Spastic, plastic, battery acid 
 Yank on the leash, dragging you backwards 
 Oh, my closed eyes 
 Never see it coming 
 There's no thing you can say 
 You can't wish me away 
 Every masochist gets a turn 
 Sadistic twist, you'll never learn 
 Battery acid, battery acid 
 Battery acid in my veins 
 Unidentified remains 
 "Yes button" broke to automatic 
 Irrational dosage of furious static 
 Erasing what you are 
 You were 
 (Jealous) to feel the way you do 
 (To mention) the lie you call the truth 
 (Feel for) nothing except yourself and nobody else 
 I got nobody else 
 There's no thing you can say 
 You can't wish me away 
 Every masochist gets a turn 
 Sadistic twist, you'll never learn 
 Battery acid, battery acidHere comes the one that you've been dreaming of 
 I am the most exalted potentate of love 
 I got a mojo hand that fits like a glove 
 I'll be coming round the mountain to get your love 
 I'm the most exalted potentate of love 
 Yes I am 
 Yes, I'm the celebrated hottentot of twat 
 Make a hole, look out, make way for a demon child 
 I'll make you hear my turtle dove 
 Ride around the range to get your love 
 Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun 
 Mad, you called me mad? 
 I have the secret to eternal love 
 Mad, you call me mad? 
 I am the most exalted potentate of love 
 Yes, I'll teach you how to read the book of life 
 You can just look at the pictures if you like 
 I'll make you hear my turtle dove 
 Ride around the range to get your love 
 Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun 
 I am the most exalted potentate 
 The most exalted potentate 
 The most exalted potentate of loveOnce you're lost 
 In twilight's blue 
 You don't find your way 
 The way finds you 
 Tempt the fates 
 Beware the smile 
 It hides all the teeth, my dear 
 And what's behind them 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 He steps between the trees 
 A crooked man 
 There's blood on the blade 
 Don't take his hand 
 You warm by the firelight 
 In twilight's blue 
 Shadows creep and dance the walls 
 He's creeping, too 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay forever 
 So glad you could stay 
 So glad you could 
 So glad 
 So glad you could stay 
 So glad you could stay foreverNicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol

 Beyond figure out 
 These lines of life 
 Have been drawn and can't be removed 
 Our eyes is all it took to know 
 Open up your eyes 
 Deep blue, glassy lake 
 And swim till water and sky 
 Now are one out of two 
 Oh, my bloodshot eyes 
 Open up your mouth 
 Touch your lips to mine 
 That we may make a kiss 
 That can pierce through death and survive 
 Your words have branded my mind 
 Still I hold your hand 
 Wrapped as if a ring 
 'Cause we of flesh and blood 
 Are only carrying 
 It's so hard to, well, you know 
 The seed waits for the reaper to sow 
 Every breath an art 
 The dignity to learn it 
 Can strain and break your heart 
 Take all your pieces home 
 You ask when you're alone 
 "What is love?" 
 The blood is loveI never lied 
 To myself 
 Tonight 
 Rose-tainted eyes 
 Color my sorrow 
 A shade of wine 
 Bye-bye, black balloon 
 I'll see you real soon 
 Wave bye-bye, bye-bye 
 Oh, why you so sad? 
 What have they done? 
 Forget those mindless baboons 
 They're off playing God 
 Copy cats in cheap suits 
 Are playing it safe 
 While cannibals of bad news 
 Consume the parade 
 Is it wonderful? 
 Kalopsia 
 Kalopsia 
 Kalopsia 
 Kalopsia 
 Kalopsia 
 Far, far from ashore 
 The land of nightmares 
 Gone forevermore 
 And I love you more 
 Than I can control 
 I don't even try 
 Why would I? 
 Oh, why the long face? 
 You've got it all wrong 
 Forget the rat in the race 
 We'll choke chain them all 
 Fates favour the ones 
 Who help themselves 
 The rest feel the sting of the lash 
 As they row 
 (as they row) 
 The boat 
 (the boat) 
 To hell 
 (to hell)Where, oh, where have you been, my love? 
 Where, oh, where can you be? 
 It's been so long since the moon has gone 
 And, oh, what a wreck you've made me 
 Are you there over the ocean? 
 Are you there up in the sky? 
 Until the return of my love 
 This lullaby 
 My hope is on the horizon 
 Every face, your eyes I can see 
 I plead and I pray through each night and day 
 Our embrace is only a dream 
 And as sure as days come from moments 
 Each hour becomes a life's time 
 When she'd left I'd only begun 
 This lullabyA song for the deaf... 
 That is for you... 
 Nobody's coming down the hall 
 Nobody echoes in my head 
 Broken reflection, out of luck 
 Nobody ever needed her 
 I got what was 
 I want to take what's left 
 For the deaf 
 Beautiful senses are gone 
 Canary in a gilded cage 
 Singin' 
 Sweet, soft, and low 
 I will poison you all 
 Come closer, racing to your turn 
 I got what was 
 I want to take what's left 
 No talk will cure 
 What's lost, or save what's left 
 For the deaf 
 The blind can go get fucked 
 Lie beside the ditch 
 This halo round my neck 
 Has torn out every stitch 
 Who are you hiding 
 Is it safe for the deaf 
 Beautiful cancer 
 Infiltrate and forget 
 And I saw you coming 
 And I heard not a thing 
 A mistake not to listen 
 When I knew where you'd been 
 And I got what was 
 I want to take what's left 
 No talk will cure 
 What's lost, or save what's left 
 For the deafWho are you, girl? 
 Who are you, boy? 
 Bet I know what you're up to 
 Can I come along? 
 Your home number on the wall 
 I just had to call, had to 
 I'm not the only one 
 Who will run with a knife 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your room 
 Open up your arms 
 8-6-2-7-8 
 2-6-3-7-8-9 
 Where's your daddy now? 
 I heard he ran away 
 Who are you, girl? 
 'Cause I'm so bored with myself, anyway 
 Any time and any place 
 I'll just hang around 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your room 
 Open up your arms 
 8-6-2-7-8 
 2-6-3-7-8-9 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your room 
 Open up your arms 
 Open up your door 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your room 
 Open up your armsI miss you now, what's come over me? 
 We're hostages of geography 
 The wait is long and heavy too 
 Despite what you're accustomed to 
 I know life moves on, that's what scares me so 
 No intentions of letting go 
 Only us, no one in the world 
 Only us, no one in the world 
 I better do something, move earth and sky 
 And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might 
 I sing only for you 
 To the beat of my footsteps in the night 
 Close your eyes and dream me home 
 Forever mine, I'll be forever yours 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermore 
 There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain 
 What's done is done till you do it again 
 Life in pursuit of a nameless prey 
 I've been so close, I'm so far away 
 It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel 
 I need you now, nothing is real 
 Save me from the villains of circumstance 
 Before I lose my place 
 Close your eyes and dream me home 
 Forever mine, I'll be forever yours 
 I'll be forever yours 
 I'll be forever yours 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermore, and on and on 
 Always, evermoreFar beyond the desert road 
 Where everything ends up 
 So good the empty space 
 Mental erase, forgive, forgot 
 Heal them like fire from a gun 
 Kneeling, my god is the sun 
 Heal them with fire from above 
 Kneeling, my god is the sun 
 Ah 
 Uh! 
 Woo-ah 
 Well, I don't know what time it was 
 I don't wear a watch 
 So good to be an ant who crawls 
 Atop a spinning rock 
 Yeah 
 Heal them like fire from a gun 
 Kneeling, my god is the sun 
 Heal them with fire from above 
 Kneeling, my god is the sun 
 A-yeah 
 Woo-ah 
 Heal them like fire from a gun 
 Kneeling, my god is the sun 
 See them kneeling? 
 Godless heathens 
 Ah 
 Godless heathens 
 Always want from the sky 
 Uh! 
 Woo-ahMe just happy robot 
 Live on hill of beans 
 You and I, cut from same cloth 
 Rippin' at the seams 
 Cut, snip 
 Cut 
 Don't forget to remember 
 The devil's got pills in his eyes 
 Look, laugh, but don't touch 
 Cut you down to size 
 Cut up 
 Cut 
 Cut up

 Lay it down but it's up in a second 
 I thought it was something I could grip on 
 I'm burning out like leaving the light on 
 Well it ain't fair, it ain't done, it ain't up to me 
 Well it ain't fair, it ain't done, it ain't up to me

 In a crooked way 
 All the crooked walkin' 
 To avoid and evade 
 Hair like maple 
 Skin like cream 
 Bet they say I love you 
 When you strip them thin 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 That you probably think this song ain't about you 
 Green eyed boys 
 Lick the razor blade 
 Girl I think I love you (girl I think I love you) 
 And the mess you made (and the mess you made) 
 Setting you up 
 It don't get you down 
 When you flash your fangs, fuck 
 You own this town 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 That you probably think this song ain't about you, uh 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 Baby, you're so vague 
 That you probably think this song ain't about you, uh

 Baby, you're so vague (ah, ah) 
 Baby, you're so vague (ah, ah)Today is the day 
 Bewilderness comes to reclaim everything 
 Burning bridge lights up the sky 
 Zip your lip until you've picked a side 
 You get right up and sit back down 
 A revolution is one spin 'round 
 You get back up and sit right down 
 A revolution is one spin 'round 
 All for one, all for naught 
 Perish baby, perish the thought 
 Beat the kids to the punch 
 You've got heart, I'll have it for lunch 
 You get right up, sit back down 
 A revolution is one spin 'round 
 You get back up and sit right down 
 Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down 
 Tell me, where's the goddamn gold? 
 (Gold) 
 Pretty pets once were wild 
 Domesticated, love slave, give us a smile 
 You got a number, is it the same? 
 Who you belong to? You feral or tame? (Probably tame) 
 Tell us where you keep the gold (Or what?) 
 We wanna help you rule the world (I think not) 
 We won't tell a single soul (So they all say) 
 So tell us, where's the goddamn gold? 
 I'll tell you where the gold is 
 It's in the ground 
 You wonder where's the reason? 
 It's in the lost and found 
 I'll tell you where the gold is 
 It's in the ground 
 You wonder where's the freedom? 
 In the lost and found, still not found 
 I'll tell you where the gold is 
 It's all mine (mine) 
 Get right up, kneel and bow 
 Where's your revolution now? 
 Get back up, sit right down 
 Tears of gold, drink them down 
 Get right up, kneel and bow 
 Shrunken heads parade through town 
 Tears of gold, drink then drown 
 Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall downCracks in a ceiling 
 Crooked pictures in the hall 
 Counting and breathing 
 I'm leaving here tomorrow 
 They don't know 
 I'd never do you any good 
 Laughing is easy 
 I would if I could 
 Ain't gonna worry 
 Just live till you die 
 I wanna drown 
 With nowhere to fall 
 Into the arms of someone 
 There's nothing to save 
 And I know 
 You live till you die 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you die 
 Losing a feeling 
 That I couldn't give away 
 Counting and breathing 
 Disappearing in the fade 
 They don't know 
 I'd never do you any good 
 Stopping and staying 
 I would if I could 
 Ain't gonna worry 
 Just live till you die 
 I wanna drown 
 With nowhere to fall 
 Into the arms of someone 
 There's nothing to save 
 I know 
 You live till you die 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you die, I know 
 Live till you dieI've got wine 
 And so do you 
 Mine came with a cork 
 I wish yours did, too 
 Everyone 
 Just loves you so 
 Well, hurray (yay) 
 Now you know where to go 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 I guess you're really all the same 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 Tell your new boy where I came 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 I just didn't want what you gave 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 Go and find yourself another slave 
 There you are 
 There you are 
 There you are 
 Ooh you're so in love 
 Just like Juliet 
 Well, guess what? 
 That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get 
 Tears from the sky 
 In pools of pain 
 Well, baby, tonight 
 I'm gonna go and dance in the rain 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 I guess you're really all the same 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 Tell your new boy where I came 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 Take that broken pussy elsewhere 
 In my head you're all brand new 
 Save it, baby, I don't careYou wanna know 
 Why you feel so hollow? 
 'Cause you are 
 You're missing out? 
 Well, if you say so 
 Then you're missing out 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 You wanna know 
 Just how long you can hide from 
 What you are? 
 Not very long 
 I have been lost 
 Down every road I follow 
 Out in the dark 
 On my way home 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 But I feel nothing, am I better yet? 
 Now I feel nothing, am I better yet? 
 And I feel nothing, am I better yet? 
 And I feel nothing, am I better yet? 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insane 
 Everybody knows that you're insaneI'm in you, you're in me 
 I can't tell 
 You're so cruel, more than me 
 It is true (that's right) 
 Loyal to only you 
 Up your sleeve 
 I want some of all of you (come on, take it, it's yours) 
 Trickin' me 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away, oh (oh) 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh 
 I would beg, I would plead 
 I would shake 
 On a hook, dangling 
 By the way 
 I'm so young and beautiful (that's right) 
 I'm no fool (I'm slick) 
 Time goes by, tables turn 
 Now I know 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away, oh (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away, oh (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away (oh) 
 First it giveth, then it taketh away 
 Away, away, ohMedication for us all 
 It's a new way 
 And we're gonna take it 'cause we love it, don't you know? 
 Is this the dose you've been dreamin' of? 
 A revelation from a gun 
 Doesn't matter 
 Overtaken, mine was yours, now overthrown 
 Just copulation in a song 
 I'm so contagious, can I cum? 
 In the new way 
 All of us cast asides became what has become 
 Medication for us all 
 You think you know me, well, you're wrong 
 Doesn't matter 
 All of us cast asides became what has becomeFrom the moment you said, "Why haven't you kissed me yet?" 
 I knew I'd wipe that paint from your lips 
 I stare the lids off your eyes, go down on your dirty mind 
 And end up between your hips 
 Handfuls of sweat-tangled hair, anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna lick you too much, baby 
 I just play all alone, whispering for your moan 
 Forced to crawl down this line just to touch 
 I can get in 
 I can't get out 
 I can get in 
 I can't get out 
 I'm just sweating my sheets, I hate to see you leave 
 But I love to watch you go, baby 
 Twisted secret lives, the way you bat your eyes 
 Givin' head, givin' head 
 Watch you come from above, I'm so needy for love 
 I'm desperate, greedy in slavery 
 I sneak around from behind, I got a one-track mind 
 We got a skin-on-skin thing, baby 
 I wanna lick you too much, I wanna lick you too much 
 I hear you comin', ooh, ah, baby 
 I wanna lick you too much, I wanna lick you too much 
 I hear you comin', ooh, ahThe blue pill opens your eyes 
 Is there a better way? 
 A new religion prescribed 
 To those without the faith 
 A hero holding a knife 
 And blood is not enough 
 Is it too late to go back? 
 Is it too late to go? 
 There's no one here (there's no one here) 
 And people everywhere (people everywhere) 
 You're on your own 
 Let's see if I'm hearing this right 
 You suggest I should take 
 A never-ending supply 
 To carry out the dead 
 Your idols burn in the fire 
 The mob comes crawling up 
 I'm reclaiming my mind 
 Destroying everyone 
 There's no one here (there's no one here) 
 And people everywhere (people everywhere) 
 You're all aloneDon't look, just keep your eyes peeled 
 Thoughtless traipsing my minds field 
 Shotgun never behind the wheel anymore 
 Danger, monsters of smoke and mirror 
 Slowly, can one so lost be found? 
 And I know you will never believe 
 I play this though I'm alright 
 If life is but a dream, then 
 Wake me up 
 Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn 
 The view from Hell is blue sky 
 So ominously blue 
 I daydream until all the blue is gone 
 And I know you will never believe 
 I play this though I'm alright 
 If life is but a dream 
 Wake me 
 Underwater 
 Is another life 
 Disregarding 
 Every myth we write 
 Rag doll churning 
 Eagerly alive 
 Over and over and gasping in horror 
 So breathless you surface just as the next wave is 
 Big smile, really a show of teeth 
 Without a care in a world of fear 
 Lonely, you don't know how I feel 
 Praise God, nothing is as it seemsIt's all in motion, no stoppin' now 
 I've got nothin' to lose and only one way up 
 I'm burning bridges, I destroy the mirage 
 Oh, visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage 
 It's all smooth sailing 
 From here on out 
 I got bruises and hickies, stitches and scars 
 Got my own theme music, plays wherever I are 
 Fear is the hand that pulls your strings 
 A useless toy, pitiful plaything 
 I'm in flagrante 
 In every way, every day 
 It's all smooth sailing 
 From here on out 
 I'm gon' do the damage 
 That needs gettin' done, yeah 
 Well, God only knows one long vacation 
 If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it 
 It's so easy to see and so hard to find 
 Make a mountain of a mole hill 
 If the mole hill is mine 
 I hypnotize you, ignore and defy you 
 I blow my load over the status quo, here we go 
 I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance 
 I risking it all-ways, no second chance 
 It's gonna be smooth sailing 
 From here on out 
 I'm gon' do the damage 
 Till the damage is done, yeah 
 God only knows, so mind your behavior 
 Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior 
 Every temple needs gold, every hook needs to shine 
 Headaches at the temple of the closed mind 
 Closed mind 
 Closed mind 
 Closed mind 
 It's all smooth sailing 
 From here on out 
 Shut up 
 PowI thought I saw him on the video 
 A trance is keeping him under 
 I know that God is in the radio 
 Che-che-che-checkin' the station 
 The narcotic from me to you 
 Just a caught in the medium 
 I know you hear it, I hear it, too 
 It's everywhere that I go 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 They say the devil is paranoid 
 Always tryin' to cover 
 But God is leakin' through the stereo 
 Between the station to station 
 You believe it, I know you do 
 You won't admit it or say so 
 I know that God is in the radio 
 Just repeating the slogan 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrong 
 You come back another day 
 And do no wrongToo late to think and filter anymore 
 A bitter pill to swallow, maybe you're 
 In a blanket haze of ephedrine, I'm wonderin' where the hell you been 
 So come on and right this wrong, you know 
 You've got it all right 
 Got a feeling 
 I'd rather open up my wrist 
 Let it go 
 You got it all right 
 Got a feeling 
 There's devils and ropes around your neck 
 Cursing them all 
 And you can't hear it 
 Can't hear it 
 Ain't got a mind to deal with anymore 
 Saboteur, infiltrator, and maybe more 
 If you're not blind and deaf, then how can we pollute your head? 
 So come on and right this wrong, you know 
 And I got it all right 
 I got a feeling 
 You'd rather open up your wrists 
 Let it go 
 And I got it all right, yeah 
 I got a feeling 
 There's devils and ropes around my neck 
 Can't even know 
 'Cause I can't hear it 
 I can't hear it 
 I can't hear it 
 I can't hear itI know, I know the sun is hot 
 Mosquitoes come, suck your blood 
 Leave you there all alone 
 Just skin and bone 
 When you walk among the trees 
 Listening to the leaves 
 The further I go, the less I know 
 The less I know 
 Where will you run? 
 Where will you hide? 
 Lullabies 
 To paralyze 
 Fat and soft, pink and weak 
 Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek 
 You know, I'm told they swallow you whole 
 Skin and bone 
 Cutting boards and hanging hooks 
 Bloody knives, cooking books 
 Promising you won't feel a thing 
 At all 
 Swallow and chew 
 Eat you alive 
 All of us food 
 That hasn't died 
 And the knife says 
 Separate, pick and pluck 
 Tenderize bone to dust 
 The sweetest grease, finest meat 
 You'll ever taste (taste, taste) 
 So you scream, whine, and yell 
 Supple sounds, a dinner bell 
 We all will feed the worms and trees 
 So don't be shy 
 Swallow and chew 
 Eat you alive 
 All of us food 
 That hasn't diedYou got a question, please don't ask it 
 It puts the lotion in the basket 
 You say bigger's better but bigger's bigger 
 White boy dressed up like a figure 
 Drawn inside a toilet on the wall 
 The world is round, my square don't fit at all 
 They say those who can't just instruct others 
 And act like victims or jilted lovers 
 You can't lose it if you never had it 
 Disappear, man, do some magic 
 You want a reason, how's about because 
 You ain't a has-been if you never was 
 I sound like this 
 Scared to say what is your passion 
 So slag it all, bitter's in fashion 
 Fear of failure's all you've started 
 The jury's in, verdict: retarded 
 I'm so tired and I'm wired, too 
 I'm a mess, I guess I'm turning on the screwNo bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around 
 Christian brothers gonna take him down 
 But it can't help me get over 
 Don't be cross, it's sick I want 
 I've seen the boss blink on and off 
 Fake concern says "what's the matter, man?" 
 And you think I ought to shake your motherfuckin' hand 
 Well, I know how much you care 
 Don't be cross, it's sick I want 
 I've seen the boss blink on and off 
 Come here by me, I want you here 
 Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear 
 Don't be cross, it's sick I want 
 I've seen the boss blink on and off 
 Come here by me, I want you here 
 Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear 
 Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clearIt's a mistake, but who knows 
 Followed you home, crawled in your window 
 This life is a trip when you're psycho in love 
 And I know 
 Followed your friends, you were not there 
 Slashed and I cut, and I bled in the sink 
 I heard what you said and you're laughing, baby 
 Slashed and I cut, and I do it for you 
 I want you to notice when I'm not around 
 Wherever you are 
 You're solid gold 
 See you in hell 
 You're solid gold 
 I'll see you in hell 
 You're solid gold 
 I'll see you in hell 
 You're solid gold 
 I'll see you in hellI don't mean to make a scene 
 But even the mob know what the hell I mean 
 The knot is tight on my blindfold 
 I got my flesh full of blood, I hate rock 'n' roll 
 Some think too much, then come too soon 
 I just curse the sun, so I can howl at the moon 
 Don't wanna love you no more, don't wanna love you less 
 I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress 
 What's the fuckin' difference, we all gonna die 
 You gonna do something killer, come on, give it a try 
 Got no big plans but a good idea 
 Let's put this town in my rearview mirror 
 Yeah, I got enemies, but they don't know 
 They won't get no glory on that side of the hole 
 We are united by drifting alone 
 This is the army of none, got no flag, got no home 
 Just witches and scabs, an awful mess 
 I confess, let's do it again, soRidin' top the floodway on a Friday night 
 The landscape's a fine and natural sight 
 Just cruisin' slow through the dark of night 
 With Precious and Grace everything's all right 
 Good God Almighty, we was goin' down slow 
 Yeah, if we knew just where we had to go 
 Cryin', just a flyin' down a put out road 
 With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford 
 So if you're out rollin' late some night 
 Yeah, and you need that supernatural delight, I'm talkin' to you, brother 
 I know somebody's, they's just out of sight 
 Get with Precious and Grace, they gonna treat you rightCalling all comas 
 Prisoner on the loose, description: 
 A spitting image of me 
 Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out 
 Shock me awake, tear me apart 
 Pinned like a note in a hospital gown 
 Prison of sleep, deeper down 
 A rabbit hole never to be found 
 Again 
 Where are you hiding, my love? 
 Cast off like a stone, feelings 
 Raw and exposed when I'm out of control 
 Pieces were stolen from me 
 Or dare I say, given away 
 Watching the water give in as I go down the drain 
 I appear missing now 
 I go missing 
 No longer exist 
 One day I hope 
 I'm someone you'd miss 
 Shock me awake, tear me apart 
 Pinned like a note in a hospital gown 
 Deeper I sleep, further down 
 A rabbit hole never to be found 
 It's only falling in love because you hit the ground 
 Dancing on wire, both ends are on fire 
 Cut me loose 
 Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend 
 Wandering along the road in the summer night 
 I go missing 
 No longer exist 
 One day I hope 
 I'm someone you'd miss 
 Shock me awake, tear me apart 
 Pinned like a note in a hospital gown 
 Deeper I sleep, further down 
 A rabbit hole never to be found 
 Confide 
 With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view 
 Don't cry 
 I never loved anything until I loved you 
 Inside 
 I'm over the edge, what can I do? 
 Sunshine 
 I haven't a thing unless I have you 
 Confide 
 With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view 
 Don't cry 
 I never loved anything until I loved you 
 Inside 
 I'm over the edge, what can I do? 
 Sunshine 
 I've fallen throughClose 
 Come close 
 Going on a living spree 
 Plenty wanna come with me 
 You don't wanna miss your chance 
 Near-life experience 
 Faces making noise 
 Say, be good girls and boys 
 It ain't half empty or full 
 You can break the glass or drink it all 
 Dig it 
 Close 
 Come close 
 Close 
 Come close 
 A grand macabaret 
 The last float on parade 
 'Cause their sleep got left behind 
 Every puzzle piece of mind 
 Handshake in facade 
 Play the fool or playing God 
 Just for God's sake play along 
 Well, you can have a laugh 
 Hit it 
 Doo doo doo doo doo ah 
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 Doo doo doo doo doo ah 
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 Doo doo doo doo doo 
 Diving 
 Falling no different 
 I fall beyond definitions now 
 Commence 
 Close 
 Come close 
 Close 
 Come close 
 Going on a living spree 
 You really wanna come with me 
 They couldn't miss the chance 
 Near-life experience 
 We're all a little tangled 
 We're all a little mangled 
 Yeah, unfold, let it go 
 Yeah, unfold, let it go 
 Yeah, unfold, let it go 
 Yeah, unfold, let it go 
 Here we come 
 Here we come 
 Here we come 
 Here we come 
 Get outta the way 
 Here we come 
 Get outta the way 
 Matters not 
 What the people say 
 Matters not 
 What the people say 
 'Cause here we come 
 Here we come 
 Here we come 
 Get outta the wayWhen you say it's dead and gone 
 Yes, I know you're wrong 
 Cut and slash, sharpest knife 
 It won't die 
 Poison cup, drank it up 
 It won't die 
 No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone 
 It won't die 
 Why you gotta shove it in my face 
 As if you put me in my place? 
 'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right 
 Ain't gonna spend another night 
 In your bed 
 In your bed 
 Laws of man are just pretend 
 They ain't mine 
 Love so good, love so bad 
 It won't die 
 Some talk too long, they know it all 
 I just smile and move on 
 Words ain't free, like you and me 
 I don't mind 
 Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel? 
 The dogs are loose, I'm on to you 
 You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk 
 Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just 
 I never came

 My eyes turns to the left to say no 
 You say first I am a special one 
 I never hammered my mind out 
 I never had the bloody hammer 
 I never had the bloody 
 Never had the bloody 
 Never had the bloody hammer 
 I am the doctor 
 I am the psychiatrist 
 To make sure they don't think that 
 They'd hammer their minds out 
 Or that they'd have a 
 That they'd have a bloody hammer 
 Second, I am this special one 
 My eyes are green and blue 
 Move safely unbegot 
 To the left to say no 
 While the others with their hair turned white 
 Each roll their eyes back 
 To the top of their heads 
 And hammer the attic, woah with a bloody hammer 
 I never had the bloody hammer 
 I never had the bloody 
 Never had the bloody 
 Never had the bloody hammer 
 It's not a sledgehammer 
 It's not a chisel 
 It's not a train 
 But a thought of unlimited horror for 
 Dr. O'Chane, Dr. O'Chane 
 Baby ghost says beat it with your chain 
 Baby ghost says don't drag your chain away 
 Dr. O'Chane 
 One bat in lightning, one bat in rain 
 One bat blanks wolfbane for 
 Dr. O'Chane, Dr. O'Chane 
 The ghost says beat it with your chain 
 The ghost says don't drag your chain away 
 Dr. O'Chane 
 All bats are as Dracula vampires 
 Vampires in the rain 
 Vampires in the lightning for 
 Dr. O'Chane, Dr. O'Chane 
 The baby ghost in the 1900s says beat it with your chain 
 The baby ghost says 
 Don't drag your spoon, don't drag your chain away 
 Dr. O'Chane 
 The demon is up in the attic to the left

 Never had the bloody 
 Never had the bloody hammerYou wanna know if I know why? 
 I can't say that I do 
 Don't understand the evil eye 
 Or how one becomes two 
 I just can't recall what started it all 
 Or how to begin the end 
 I ain't here to break it 
 Just see how far it will bend 
 Again and again, again and again 
 I wanna make it 
 I wanna make it wit chu 
 Anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna make it (again and again) 
 I wanna make it wit chu 
 Sometimes the same is different 
 But mostly it's the same 
 These mysteries of life 
 That just ain't my thing 
 If I told you that I knew about the sun 
 And the moon I'd be untrue 
 The only thing I know for sure 
 Is what I wan' do 
 Anytime, anywhere 
 I wanna make it (again and again) 
 I wanna make it wit chu
