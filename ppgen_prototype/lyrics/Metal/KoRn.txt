 Hey Ho 
 I like pie 
 Apple Pie 
 Meat is murder 
 Beef is nasty 
 My shoes are cool 
 I bought them from payless 
 YipyipyipyipyaeeeeeWe are the ones taking all the pain falling on our faces 
 They dont care anyway anyway now 
 Youre the one that makes me feel like Im alive 
 Youre the one that pushes me all the time all the time now 
 We are hard and grey always praised to do what they say 
 Calling me deranged feeling power I must take its place some way 
 Never gonna run away seeking out the path but the pain always gets in the way 
 Slowly watch me die 
 Im insane so dangerous dont you dare get in my way 
 Throwing in the towel got me strained so betrayed get the fuck out of my way 
 Looking at my thoughts I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 We are the ones reaching out in vain trying to solve our problems 
 They wont go away go away now 
 Never gonna run away seeking out my path but the pain always gets in the way 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Looking at my thoughts I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veinsAlways its coming and here starts the game 
 Why cant this puzzle be solved 
 Each time it happens its always the same I look down and it starts to fall 
 And all I see it burns my eyes burning all inside 
 Caught in the corners of my mind beginning over one more time 
 Taking me over taking all thats mine one more time 
 Always this teasing sometimes I lose faith 
 Where is my strength to hold on 
 Facing existence how can I relate 
 Do I stand still or move on 
 Taking me over taking all thats mine one more time 
 Falling through this space and time buried in this hurt of mine 
 Falling slowly like a dream falling through a world unseen 
 Why can I not break this spell 
 Im in darkness is this Hell 
 Falling towards this hole I see this is how it has to be 
 One more timeCome on 
 Save some for me its what I like 
 I wanna play you know its time 
 Something is calling I cant keep from falling 
 Come on its on 
 You see its my fault angels stabbing me inside 
 Nothing changes just rearranges for me this time 
 Once I cave in what can I fight 
 I can never win 
 Myself I dont like 
 I dont like I dont like I dont like 
 This time this time 
 For me inside put me inside 
 Hold me this time put me inside 
 Come on come on its onNas 
 Everybodys an Enemy 
 Tellin me lies and its killin me 
 Why they all want to get rid of me 
 Everybodys my enemy 
 Several try to disguise the devil in them 
 Wantin get into my cerebellum but Im 
 Ready and willing to tell them I cant  with them 
 Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling 
 Like my dick does watching naked teachers 
 Do sick stuff on my born collection on TV 
 Nas 
 Trust nobody 
 I dont know who to call a friend 
 They all just pretend to be 
  Everybody this is to all of yall 
 Cause everybody is an enemy x2 
 Watching my own back 
 Strapped with chrome to my homies 
 Where the tombstones at where the hoes at 
 Cause to many didnt act like dykes hermaphrodites 
 With benzene amen 
 Look at the trash they biting 
 The life in times is kinda wetter 
 Like the time and life of the sandman 
 On Apollo theater 
 Imagine that from the black with a hook 
 Who pulls the wack talent off the stage 
 Im in rage 
 Korn 
 You fill your lies around me 
 And you think youve won 
 You feel you can control me 
 With the things youve done 
 Jermaine Dupri

 Haunting me taking its sweet time 
 Holding on Im lost in a haze 
 Fighting life til the end of my days

 Erase them all and reclaim my place 
 In the past I was known as a freak 
 Had no friends picked on cause I was weak 
 Save my ass I got into this band 
 Never thought the band would pick on the man 
 Reclaim my place

 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Lock him up real tight 
 Throw away the key 
 And then turn off all the lights 
 First were going to set some bait 
 Inside a nasty trap and wait 
 When he comes asniffing 
 We will snap the trap and close the gate 
 Wait Ive got a better plan 
 To catch this big red lobster man 
 Lets pop him in a boiling pot 
 And when hes done well butter him up 
 Throw him in a box 
 Bury him for ninety years 
 Then see if he talks 
 Then Mr Oogie Boogie Man 
 Can take the whole thing over then 
 Hell be so pleased I do declare 
 That he will cook him rare 
 I say that we take a cannon 
 Aim it at his door 
 And then knock three times 
 And when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more 
 Youre so stupid think now 
 If we blow him up to smithereens 
 We may lose some pieces 
 And then Jack will beat us black and green 
 Tie him in a bag 
 Throw him in the ocean 
 Then see if he is sad 
 Because Mr Oogie Boogie 
 Is the meanest guy around 
 If I were on his Boogie list 
 Id get out of town 
 Hell be so pleased by our success 
 That hell reward us too I bet 
 Perhaps hell make his special brew 
 Of snake and spider stew 
 Were his little henchmen and 
 We take our job with pride 
 We do our best to please him 
 And to stay on his good side 
 I wish my cohorts werent so dumb 
 Im not the dumb one youre no fun shut up 
 Ive got something listen now 
 This ones real good youll see 
 Well send a present to his door 
 Upon therell be a note to read 
 Now in the box well wait and hide 
 Until his curiosity 
 Entices him to look inside 
 And then well have him one two three 
 Beat him with a stick 
 Lock him up for ninety years 
 And see what makes him tick 
 Chop him into bits 
 Mr Oogie Boogie 
 Is sure to get his kicks 
 See what we will see 
 Lock him in a cage and then 
 Throw away the keyIn der Angst kann man leben wörtl Angst ist ein Ort zum Leben 
 Ich fühle dich überall um mich herum 
 Deine Stimme sie umringt mich 
 Du erzählst mir weiterhin was ich hören möchte 
 Du bist wunderbar 
 So talentiert 
 Ich brauche dich 
 Wir haben etwas 
 Falls du jemals etwas brauchst ich werde da sein 
 In der Angst kann man leben 
 Reiß die Maske von deinem Kopf 
 Zeig mir das wahre Gesicht das du versteckst 
 Obwohl ich eine Meile von dir entfernt bin sehe ich dich 
 Du starrst weiterhin wirkst als wolltest du sagen 
 Heuchlerische Missgeburten wörtl Falsche Arsch Menschen umzingeln mich 
 Anfangs sind sie immer nett 
 Sie schlagen mit ihren Klauen 
 Heuchlerische Missgeburten umzingeln mich 
 Sie schlagen ihre Klauen genau in mich rein 
 Aber am Ende bin ich der Vollidiot wörtl Aber am Ende werde ich immer gefickt 
 Aber am Ende bin ich der Vollidiot 
 am Ende bin ich der Vollidiot 
 Falsches Arschloch 
 Zeig mir das wahre Gesicht das du versteckstBaby baby baby baby baby 
 Take a look around no one can make me 
 Deep inside this space is where I hate me 
 Snuck a ride Im so alive just save me 
 Hands on your head and your chest feeling tight 
 You wanna look around and shake me 
 You wanna fuck around and let me go this time 
 Whats even worse you tried to break me 
 You go and look around and see what you can find 
 See what you can find 
 You can find 
 Baby baby baby baby baby 
 I know what you came here for to tempt me 
 Quiet down the thoughts that brace to kick me 
 Either way I know that youll resent me 
 Taking my time taking my chances 
 Take me away sick of these dances 
 I wanna save you I wanna blame you 
 I wanna save you I wanna blame youIts so fucked I am here doing this 
 Its bullshit things dont end like this 
 Im calling 
 Staring into this place 
 Where I cease to exist 
 Wondering why do things always end up like this 
 Jon Fly 
 Take to the sky another dream of empty 
 Jon Lies 
 Of promises denied by a forgiving 
 Jon God 
 Who eats his young youre nothing you fucking 
 Jon Fraud 
 My belief was betrayed I lost my faith in you 
 Jon Try 
 To understand the sorrow and the 
 Jon Why 
 Of a light that should still be burning 
 Jon Bright 
 The angel in flight with a dog by his 
 Jon Side 
 When you took him away I lost my faith in even you 
 Its so fucked I am here doing this 
 As I feel emptiness growing in my heart 
 I cant help but scream into hating you 
 I bet you think its funny 
 You give us a gift and then you take it back 
 I bet you think its funnyPounding it starts again 
 Hurting oh where do I begin 
 Screaming they dance around my head hoping theyll make me end up dead 
 Feeling it grab hold what can I say 
 Feeling fuckedup again 
 Ive gotta do this right 
 I cant fucking give in 
 Ive given my goodbyes 
 Cant I ever win 
 Ill scream with all my might 
 Here it comes again 
 Silence it goes away 
 Patience oh really should I stay 
 Trying so hard to get ahead failure is often where Im led 
 Oh I must hold on 
 Oh I wont be gone 
 Oh I wont stop now 
 Oh I dont know how 
 Why I cant hold on 
 Here we go again again here we go again again 
 Why I cant be gone 
 Why I cant stop now 
 Why I dont know how 
 Here we go again again 
 Here we go again 
 Here it comes againYou and me 
 We have no faces 
 Soon our lives will be erased 
 Do you think they will remember 
 Or will we just be replaced 
 Oh I wish that I could see 
 How I wish that I could fly 
 All the things that hang above me 
 To a place where I can cry 
 So what can it be 
 No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me 
 No ones there 
 To all these nameless feelings 
 I cant deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people 
 Tryin to feed on what is mine 
 Youve got to fill your hunger 
 And stop  with my mind 
 I know its time to leave these places far behind 
 You and me 
 They dont see us anymore 
 Without love as they had promised 
 And no faith for whats in store 
 Where are all these feelings hiding 
 Dancing in and out my mind 
 Burning up all that I long for 
 Feeding me till my decline 
 Where are you 
 My soul is bleeding 
 I am searching 
 Am I blind 
 All alone and bound forever 
 Trapped inside me for all time 
 Far behind 
 To leave these places far behindLiving life 
 Dont you cry 
 Pain is God 
 Many nights 
 Painful thoughts occur 
 Yell at me 
 Again Im wrong 
 In denial 
 I tried to be your friend 
 I tried to be 
 A good boy 
 All I see 
 A hate deep inside 
 Startle me 
 Someone save me 
 Now these memories 
 Fill my heart 
 They bury me 
 All I want to do 
 You are not my real mother 
 Is kill you 
 Should I beat and stab and fuck her 
 Looking back 
 I was never ever right 
 You were my stepmom 
 Who always wanted me out of your sight 
 I would come walking in and Id say Hello 
 But you would slap me 
 And you would make some fuckedup comment about my clothes 
 But I tried to let it pass 
 But the pictures in my head were with you 
 With a knife up your ass laying dead 
 So I popped some more caps in your ass 
 Now your son is not so fun 
 Motherfucking bitch never try to play me 
 You make my life 
 Not so good 
 Wish 
 Ha ha 
 You 
 Ha 
 Were dead 
 Now I know 
 How can I cry over someone I never loved 
 Never loved 
 Never lovedNow look at you 
 Youre like a train wreck that is in slow motion 
 If I were you 
 Id trade away that every guilty notion 
 If this is true 
 Would you lie would you cheat would you try to remind me 
 Of something really new 
 Still a dive in grasping in the emotion 
 Is it love 
 But Ill never face the truth 
 Im lost and out of you 
 I shouldve known 
 Youre so cold and how could I be so clueless 
 A thought youd grown 
 But only grew more sick and in debt to stillness 
 Id walk away 
 But the price is high and I guess Ill manage 
 Ive done this great for two 
 And if you lay down will I still feel sadness 
 I cant escape you wish I could break this chain 
 I cant relate to these little fucking games 
 These little fucking games 
 Out of you 
 I cant relate to these little fucking gamesI think this is the most talking Ive ever done in my whole career 
 Were gonna play Got The Life for yall 
 Hate something sometime someway 
 Something kick down the front floor

 Each day I feel so hollow 
 Inside always beating me

 So come dance with me 
 Dance with me

 Got The Life x9I cant remember anything 
 Cant tell if this is true or dream 
 Deep down inside I feel the scream 
 This terrible silence stops with me 
 Now that the war is through with me 
 Im waking up I cannot see 
 That theres not much left of me 
 Nothing is real but pain now 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God wake me 
 Back in the womb its much too real 
 In pumps life that I must feel 
 But cant look forward to reveal 
 Look to the time when Ill live 
 Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
 Just like a wartime novelty 
 Tied to machines that make me be 
 Cut this life off from me 
 Now the world is gone Im just one 
 Oh God help me 
 Oh please God help me 
 Darkness 
 Imprisoning me 
 All that I see 
 Absolute horror 
 I cannot live 
 I cannot die 
 Trapped in myself 
 Body my holding cell 
 Landmine has taken my sight 
 Taken my speech 
 Taken my hearing 
 Taken my arms 
 Taken my legs 
 Taken my soul 
 Left me with life in hellAl caer la noche 
 La gente dormía 
 En Jaral el progreso terminó 
 La luna lo ocultaba 
 Nadie se lo esperaba 
 A jaral el infierno ya llegó 
 Un mandato divino 
 Quizá sólo el destino 
 En Jaral el demonio apareció 
 Abrió las cerraduras 
 Liberó a sus criaturas 
 ¡Oh si el infierno comenzó 
 Puente 
 Creyeron que Jaral  ¡Estaba perdido 
 Pero estaban mal  ¡Se equivocaron 
 Apareció un mortal  Un salvador 
 Desafió a Satanás  Con una baraja en la mano 
 Caminó hacia la bestia 
 Se paró frente a ella 
 Y una de sus cartas él tomó 
 Con fuerza impresionante 
 Se inclinó pa delante 
 La carta de su mano disparó 
 Satanás rugió 
 Pues la carta lo hirió 
 Y el infierno se desplomo 
 El guardó sus cartas 
 Y se sacudió las palmas 
 Y Jaral para siempre abandonó 
 CORO 
 JARAL  Del progreso 
 JARAL  Un exceso 
 Dobles 
 JARAL  El averno 
 JARAL  Sin tropiezoAre you ready for a good pounding baby 
 Get down

 A snapshot in the family album 
 Daddy what else did you leave for me 
 Daddy whatcha leave behind for me 
 All in all it was just a brick in the wall 
 All in all it was all just bricks in the wall 
 We dont need no education 
 We dont need no thought control 
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
 Teachers leave them kids alone 
 Hey teachers leave those kids alone 
 All in all its just another brick in the wall 
 All in all youre just another brick in the wall 
 We dont need no thought control 
 I dont need no arms around me 
 I dont need no drugs to calm me 
 I have seen the writing on the wall 
 Dont think I need anything at all 
 No dont think Ill need anything at all 
 All in all you were all just bricks in the wall 
 Goodbye cruel world 
 Im leaving you today 
 Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
 Goodbye all you people 
 Theres nothing you can say 
 To make me change my mind 
 Goodbyespoken 
 Were doing this song 
 Again we were tryin to figure out different ways to make this 
 Special and different because of the acoustic thing were not really used to this 
 And we decided to invite a Tyco and sound volume up to this 
 These are Japenese Tyco drums and I think its really amazing 
 Its when were all playing together 
 So um I want to I can do their thing in this song 
 Were gonna go into a strumy way well just let them go first 
  
 Singing 
  
 Flesh wound flesh wound 
 With medication it will fade 
 Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray 
 Love full of hate 
 Dont you love how I break 
 Dont let them throw me away 
 Ahha 
 Keep me and Ill be okay 
 Skipping a beat but it plays 
 Dont let them throw me away 
 Screwed up used up 
 Crumpled lying on the floor 
  Up shut up 
 All you did back then was score 
 Im feeling weak 
 Missing parts 
 Incomplete 
 Hold me up into the light 
 Fix the cracks fix them right 
 Keep the pieces in the drawer 
 Keep them there for ever more 
 May come in use for someday 
 Recycle this  in someway 
 And all that I have to say 
 Please let them throw me away 
 spoken 
 Thank you guys very much for coming out tonight 
 It was awesome 
 I really appreciate it 
 Yall have a good nightYou can see I fly 
 Disguise evil trapped in every eye 
 You can watch me play 
 Taste your juices from me all day 
 You can see I try this all for you 
 You can see I despise all of you 
 You can see Im trying something new 
 You can see me fly 
 Sometime somewhere 
 Deceit leads you nowhere 
 You try so hard 
 To be the superstar 
 So come on with me 
 Take you on a slow ride set you free 
 Someone cant you see 
 Going on this way free youll never be 
 So you see I try this all for you 
 So you see I despise all of you 
 So you see I trying something new 
 So you see me fly 
 Sometimes somewhere 
 Just take me away 
 Take me away x 8 
 Take me 
 Take me away x 5Honestly somehow it always seems that 
 Im dreamin of somethin I can never be 
 It doesnt matter to me cause I will 
 Always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies 
 I dont know your fuckin name 
 So what lets 
 Screamin to be the only way that 
 I can truly be free from my fuckedup reality 
 So I dream and stroke it harder cause 
 Its so fun to see my face starin back at me 
 So what lets fuck 
 All day I dream about sex 
 All day I dream about fuckin 
 Yes all day I dream about sex 
 And all day I dream about sex 
 All day I dream about fuckinBlood is pouring sleep is pouring 
 Dont stop running Im here counting 
 The lies the pain the pain the hate 
 Will he keep fuckin with me 
 Theres nowhere else to go 
 So I walk but seem to crawl for Im giving in today 
 Now I run into a wall cause I cannot fight my way 
 Youve gotta come with me 
 I cannot stand this place 
 Were falling off the world 
 And Ill give in this way 
 We had a chance to run 
 And now I cant believe 
 Were going all the way 
 And now to deaths embrace 
 My lies worry life is story 
 Give up beating Ill start needing 
 Embrace embrace 
 Oh uh uh uh oh 
 Uh uh uh oh 
 Why really do I have to follow 
 Nothing makes sense at all 
 Taking something for nothing 
 Watch me as I fall 
 Im bringing me down Im bringing me down 
 Im bringing me down 
 And now to deaths embraceI never knew what I was gonna be 
 Somebody saw what I couldnt see and lifted me up 
 Now I never thought I could be worthy of 
 Lovin and care in the sky above 
 Dont let the thunder fall 
 Why does everybody have to fit in 
 Feel so damn comfortable in the skin 
 Does that mean I am the 
 Souvenir of sadness 
 Method to the madness 
 Hands up if you feel this 
 Anyone who has this 
 Stand up nobodys dying to save you 
 Speak up nobodys waiting to see you 
 Wake up nobodys working to pay you 
 Let me make it clear you had this 
 Back then nobody knew in the schoolyard 
 Now then you had grown up to be this whore 
 Go then walk through this world with your heart scarred 
 Youre the souvenir of sadness 
 They never knew what I was gonna say 
 Punch me and kick me and run away 
 You know who you are 
 So now look at me what do you have to say 
 Never cared much for you anyway 
 Never cared much for you any 
 Were happy childhood backlash 
 Youre the souvenir of sadnessA slap in the face it is endowed 
 The light of my life is put out somehow 
 Im lying in pieces of emotions you control 
 Youre feeding my sympathy the lie unfolds 
 Feeling this hostility I pray 
 Begging make this evil go away 
 Coveting the things I only fear 
 Building my sanctuary of blood and tears 
 The lines that I traced 
 Around the scars they swell 
 Implant with a sedative 
 To numb this spell 
 Youre feeding this cancer 
 Its taken hold 
 Feeling animosity 
 When no one else is around 
 Blindly I scream into the air 
 Eating my heart off the ground 
 GroundIm staring at a face I dont recognize 
 Rotten and replaced lifeless and benign 
 You can never say that I didnt try 
 I cannot erase whats in my mind 
 Im the one to give to you Im the one to break you through 
 Anything you ever do will eat you up and impale you 
 Im bleeding out been crucified by trusting you 
 Hate turns to shame by praising you adoring fool 
 Im the one that set you free bound to burn for eternity cause Im bleeding out 
 Youre never there when I need you 
 My thoughts they interlace been spun out for sometime 
 I wander in this maze an act that is sublime 
 Youre never there when I need youDo you really want to see 
 I dont think I can take this anymore 
 You are naive  I am nothing 
 Im disgusting and so much more 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Feeling like somehow I spoiled you 
 Dying is a trial Ive been to 
 This is the time for truth and pain 
 Do you really want to see the torment hatred of this world 
 Hand in a book  I believed it 
 All it brought me was pain and more 
 Dying is a trial Ive I been to 
 I believe I believe 
 Holding All These Lies I told you 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Holding All These Lies I told you 
 Lies I told you 
 Truth is pain 
 I believe 
 I never meant to hurt you 
 I never meant to betray you 
 I never meant to hurt youCracked phone line 
 Means nothing 
 My brains in fights and vain 
 My breathing 
 So shallow 
 It helps to curb the pain 
 Whats outside 
 Sneaks inside 
 How we contaminate 
 This warzone of my soul 
 I underestimate 
 Ive never really thought about it that much 
 Its only ever violence thats in my touch 
 Appears appears appears 
 I am built this way 
 The pills they quit working 
 They take more than they give 
 Emotions on flat line 
 Its all that I can give 
 The rising 
 The falling 
 My mind keeps tricking me 
 It throws me a life raft 
 Then leaves me out at sea 
 I am built this wayPut your hand against your skin 
 Rub it gently to begin 
 You feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 When does pleasure become pain 
 When does sex become insane 
 You say it 
 As you feel it 
 When you come 
 Be a good girl 
 Hold your breath 
 Make it last long 
 Its a mess 
 And its called 
 The little death girl 
 So please 
 When you die could you scream 
 Mercy 
 Mercy for you and me 
 Its true 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drug 
 When you cry let it flow 
 I might 
 Make you stay let you go 
 Push that one more time thats all 
 And the rain begins to fall 
 People who aint seen shit been 
 Telling you that its a sin 
 Le petit mort 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drugFeeling really out of place 
 Spent beyond too much time 
 Alone for a lifetime searching for things I will never find 
 I am here to take 
 Whatever I feel is mine 
 Feeling like Im never needed 
 Walking alone blind 
 Once upon a time 
 I Never thought Id end up dead 
 For the thoughts thats in my head 
 From time to time 
 Feeling like Im on a plane thats going down 
 Looking at another face 
 Looking for another sign 
 Alone in my bed wasted without fear waiting for my time 
 For the thoughts thats in my head 
 I dont understand here 
 Why God would do me this way 
 I lived a life 
 Was always good 
 The one thing I need to take away 
 To take away 
 The one thing Take away 
 Just take away 
 One thing to take away 
 Away Away 
 It took away my world 
 All it left was pain 
 And all this time was for nothing 
 Feeling like Im on a plane thats going downFlesh wound flesh wound 
 With medication it will fade 
 Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray 
 Love full of hate 
 Dont let them throw me away 
 Aha 
 Keep me and Ill be okay 
 Skipping a beat but it plays 
 Fuckedup shut up 
 Fix the cracks and fix them right 
 Recycle this shit in someway 
 Is dont let them throw me away 
 Almost silent Away until endWe got a fuckedup reason to live 
 Who really gives a fuck 
 Were gonna wake up hate were gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything I wanna make it sting 
 Were gonna wake up hate were gonna wake it up 
 You gotta get it straight were gonna give it up 
 I am the burden of my everything and of its scar 
 Ill be reborn in hatred feeling I cant love no more 
 Ive had to suffer I cannot wait for more 
 No loving and no praying all my life is for the taking 
 We got a fuckedup reason to live 
 I am the falling of my happiness it is no more 
 Stop loving Im still hating til I cannot hate no more 
 Im filthy wasted piece of shit 
 I am disgusting take me away 
 Were gonna wake up hate were gonna wake 
 Were gonna wake up hate were gonna wake it upIm digging with my fingertips Im gripping at the ground I stand upon 
 Im searching for fragile bones 
 Evolution 
 Im never gonna be refined keep trying but I wont assimilate 
 Should we have come far in time 
 Watch the bow break 
 And Im sorry I dont believe by the evidence that I see that theres any hope left for me 
 Its evolution just evolution 
 And I I do not dare deny the basic beast inside 
 Its right here its controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die 
 Im dominated by this animal thats locked up inside 
 Close up to get a real good view Im betting that the species will survive 
 Hold tight Im getting inside you 
 And when were gonna find these bones theyre gonna wanna keep them in a jar 
 The number one virus caused by procreation 
 And the planet may go astray in a million years I say 
 Those motherfuckers were all deranged 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around take a look around take a look around take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around take a look around take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around take a look around 
 Why 
 Why Why Why 
 Why do I deserve to die 
 Do I deserve to die Why Why WhyIm falling in this pit of sorrow 
 I really dont care anyway 
 Happiness Im looking to borrow 
 Even four last seconds okay 
 Im starting to feel so hollow 
 Fill me up then go on your way 
 I doubt Ill be leasing tomorrow 
 So Ill just do my best anyway 
 Hold me now Ive been knocking down 
 Killing all these waves of shame 
 Hold me down feeling not so sound 
 Wish I wasnt born today 
 Im starting to break my devotion 
 What does that mean anyway 
 Running into signs interwoven 
 So much that it gets in my way 
 Killing all these waves of shame 
 Wish I wasnt born todayRealized I can never win 
 Sometimes feel like I have failed 
 Inside where do I begin 
 My mind is laughing at me 
 Tell me why am I to blame 
 Arent we supposed to be the same 
 Thats why I will never tame 
 This thing thats burning in me 
 I am the one who chose my path 
 I am the one who couldnt last 
 I feel the life pulled from me 
 I feel the anger changing me 
 Sometimes I can never tell 
 If Ive got something after me 
 Thats why I just beg and plead 
 For this curse to leave me 
 Tell me why am I to blame 
 its burning in me 
 Betrayed 
 I feel so enslaved 
 I really tried 
 I did my time 
 Oh God the angers changing me 
 Oh God the angers changing meThis shit right here is for you 
 All your faces I can see 
 You all think its about me 
 Im about to break 
 This is my fate 
 Am I still damned to a life 
 Of misery and hate 
 You will never know 
 What Ive done for you 
 What you all 
 Put me through 
 I do it for you 
 I could have 
 Never lived 
 If it wasnt for youI cant believe whats happening 
 Where is your self control 
 Why cant you just be honest 
 The corruption takes its toll 
 You rape our hope 
 Too proud to cope 
 You built this house of shame 
 You smile you gloat 
 This disease you promote 
 An infection is what we are now 
 I cant believe this happened 
 The fear starts to grab hold 
 Then anger starts to take over 
 I will not be controlled 
 Theyre taking over now 
 Eating up our souls somehow 
 Taking over now 
 Parasites they run around 
 The culprits wont be found 
 They lie behind this mask of wealth 
 Illuminati they hide 
 An infection is what we are nowFuck you

 You need a reason to believe 
 A reason to deceive 
 A reason for the song youre singing 
 And everything you do 
 Makes perfect sense to you 
 So why is your alarm bell ringing 
 You say you know how it feels inside of me 
 Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
 Come on inside 
 And hear the silence constantly judging me 
 Dont you think you should move on 
 Oh now youre so fucking holy 
 You need a way to get along 
 A way to carry on 
 A symptom for the pain youre making 
 And surely you should know 
 That everywhere you go 
 Theres acid in the words youre faking 
 You write it so youd best believe it 
 You sold it now your soul perceives it 
 You waver but for now agree with it 
 The damage and betrayal 
 To hell with the 
 Reason to believe 
 Dont you think you should move onEvery day it gets a little harder cant seem to get away 
 I remember theres a certain place a place I wish I would stay 
 I feel so lost within pressured Im headed for that day 
 Just one thought in my head really Do I need this fame 
 Every time goddamn I look at my seed I see something I cant be 
 Beautiful and carefree thats how I used to be 
 Like some goddamn fuckin freak Im so pressured Im so weak 
 Something takes a hold of me something I cant believe 
 I lay in bed at night and wonder should I go on this way 
 Its the only thing I really got for now and its called fame 
 So I see this face so innocent and fine and so fine 
 So I see this face and I realize its mine 
 I feel the rattle 
 So I see this face so innocent and fine and so fine 
 So I see this face and I realize its mine 
 Like some goddamn fuckin freak 
 Like some goddamn fuckin freakLife is within my body

 Throw your hate at me with all you might 
 Hit me cause Im strange hit me 
 You tell me Im a pussy and your harder than me 
 Whats with you boy Think hard 
 A tattooed body to hide who you are 
 Scared to be honest be yourself 
 A cowardly man

 Youre just a wannabe 
 To come out 
 Hit me clown because Im not from your town now hit me clown 
 Clown you aint  Turn around get your face split 
 Turn if you like 
 Im just a  mental

 Thanking all the fucked people 
 Thanking all the shit I love 
 They are all the things Ive made 
 Straight from my heart 
 Begging all the same people 
 Burning is the same evil 
 Somehow making me feel sane 
 Waiting all this time 
 Ive got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my life 
 I can see before Im gone 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
 All the hate thats breaking me 
 I realise Im taking everything 
 And the kids seem to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me 
 To a place Im hate to be 
 All along I seem to make believe 
 And the shit seems to follow 
 Im thinking of 
 Making all the fucked people 
 Making the bitches I love 
 Make them die and go away 
 Pain from the start 
 All my dreams are ripped apart 
 They are all the things Ive saved 
 To a place Im meant to be 
 Your life I hate it 
 Oh God can I reclaim 
 Stop and help me 
 The shit seems to followEveryone is looking at me 
 I cant get out of bed 
 There is evil in my head 
 Everyone just let me be 
 Because when I hit the stage 
 It is gone and I am free 
 Goddamn you say youll get up with me 
 Youre the crowd come on give it back to me 
 You wont Beg For Me Beg For Me Beg For Me 
 You wont Beg For Me be there for me Beg For Me 
 Tell me how could this fade 
 I am going insane 
 And I could not have my pain 
 Everyone please let me be 
 Cause when I hit the stage 
 I feel the shame Ive gone insane 
 The things I feel now arent the same 
 Who gives a fuck if my life sucks 
 I just know one thing I wont give up 
 Be there for me 
 Be there for mePain 
 Buried so far away 
 Into my life of nothing 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole bury pain 
 I am so high always 
 Burying my life so slowly 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Cant face boredom without something 
 Reentering my head 
 Feeling like Im God 
 With the world around me 
 Cant you feel this pain 
 Reaming through my heart 
 Screaming through my veins 
 Nothing I can kill 
 Screaming a 
 Lie 
 I 
 Am 
 Cant you tear 
 My 
 Eyes 
 Out 
 Cant you take my heart 
 Away 
 To heart

 Verse One Ice Cube 
 Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse 
 Ride on the outside with inner force 
 Throw you off course of course you missed the runway 
 We mash like the first kickoff on a Sunday 
 Collisions divisions of niggaz down to listen 
 And when we on the mission call your mortician 
 First we flank em then we spank em I outrank em 
 You can call me Citizen Kane for my reign 
 Ten years great one of the ten great 
 Mr Media look inside your encyclopedia

 Worldwide your highness the finest 
 Big as China nigga rhymer chart climber 
 Quick to send a firsttimer back to his Aunt Jemimah 
 Physical nigga roll with the winners 
 After these dinners go out and represent us 
 We got antennas scanners and satellites 
 To see if you battle right we got to bite 
 Hold on tight shake and pump venom 
 Some haters dont learn till you leave lead in em 
 See the dead in em rigarmortis spread in em 
 Keep your mouth shut motherfuckin mouth slug 
 See these crossed legs quick to cross Feds 
 Foe to mighty one its the mighty son 
 Fuck dying echoes 
 Yeah 
 Join the party I can provide the armySomething takes a part of me 
 Something lost and never seen 
 Every time I start to believe 
 Somethings raped and taken from me from me 
 Lifes got to always be messing with me 
 You wanna see the light 
 Cant they chill and let me be free 
 So do I 
 Cant I take away all this pain 
 I try to every night all in vain in vain 
 Sometimes I cannot take this place 
 Sometimes its my life I cant taste 
 Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
 Youll never see me fall from grace 
 Something takes a part of me 
 You and I were meant to be 
 A cheap fuck for me to lay 
 Feeling like a freak on a leash 
 Feeling like I have no release 
 How many times have I felt diseased 
 Nothing in my life is free is free 
 Boom nah dah mmm nah dah heema 
 Dah boom da da mmm dum naeema 
 So buy 
 Something on the mingaboo 
 Buy 
 Some things they buy 
 So 
 Something off the heehahoo 
 No 
 Something off the mingaboo 
 Part of me 
 Part of mePick me up 
 Been bleeding too long 
 Right here right now 
 Ill stop it somehow 
 I will make it go away 
 Cant be here no more 
 Seems this is the only way 
 I will soon be gone 
 These feelings will be gone 
 Now I see the times they changed 
 Leaving doesnt seem so strange 
 I am hoping I can find 
 Where to leave my hurt behind 
 All the shit I seem to take 
 All alone I seem to break 
 I have lived the best I can 
 Does this make me not a man 
 Shut me off 
 Im ready 
 Heart stops 
 I stand alone 
 Cant be on my own 
 Am I going to leave this place 
 What is it Im running from 
 Is there nothing more to come 
 Am I gonna leave this place 
 Is it always black in space 
 Am I going to take its place 
 Am I going to win this race 
 I guess Gods up in this place 
 What is it that Ive become 
 Is there something more to come 
 More to come 
 Now I see the times they change 
 Leaving us it seem so strange 
 Does this make me not a manWhat were you thinking 
 I guess Ill never know 
 See your eyes blinking pupils begin to grow 
 Drilling you softly pulling you in 
 Making your mind up whats sick or a sin 
 Open up now let it all go 
 Im quite certain say it aint so 
 Youre corrupted by some sick fuck 
 Oh no 
 Open up now head in the sky 
 Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies feel its in my mouth 
 You breathe in but cant breathe out 
 What youve been taking it makes you talk real slow 
 How come Im thinking youd be the last to know 
 Youd be the last to know 
 Choking you gently gaining control 
 Hand you the shovel to dig your own hole 
 Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies feel its in my mouth 
 Ah 
 You breathe in but cant breathe outAre you ready for a good pounding baby 
 Get down 
 Get down get down 
 Dont pretend youre not fuckin freaky baby 
 Get down on the ground

 This nigga lookin at me wrong 
 So I pulled out my motherfuckin nine 
 And I SMOKED HIS ASS 
 Woke up didnt choke up 
 Saw my AK it was broke up 
 Put it together like a jigsaw 
 Got my nine and my Rambo knife off the floor 
 Went to the bathroom and beat the rush 
 Yo who the fuck used my toothbrush 
 Went to my sisters room yo bitch wake up 
 You stupid ass dirty ass nasty ass slut 
 Shot her in the leg shot her in the thigh 
 Kick her in the pussy and punched her in the eye 
 Slapped her in the head stepped on her corns 
 Dont fuck with mine bitch word is born 
 Went downstairs to eat wit my folks 
 Ma you broke my fuckin egg yoke 
 Punch her in the chest cut on her cheek 
 Then I did a sweep knocked the bitch off her feet 
 Knee to the pussy kick to the skull 
 AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple 
 Pops got mad cause mom got licked 
 I didnt give a fuck so I shot him in the dick 
 Hungry as fuck said my grace 
 Pop kept screamin so I shot him in the face 
 Ate my food found my coat 
 Mailman came so I cut his motherfuckin throat 
 Waitin for the motherfuckin school bus 
 Yo yo yo yo yo Dres yo Dres

 What the fuck was the dream about G 
 I dreamed that I was hardI cant stand the sight of you

 I cant stand all the thought of you 
 I cant stand all the things you do 
 Why do you try to justify 
 You are just too scared to be you inside 
 Let it all go 
 Look at you all I see is a man too afraid to really be 
 I cant stand even the thought of you 
 Your secret lies that you hide 
 You try so hard to be wanted 
 False emotions tears you fronted 
 I feel being a person relies on one thing be yourself let you come through 
 Youre too afraid to really be someone who isnt false who doesnt care to be 
 Youre too afraid to really be be yourself let you come through 
 Fake

 Yeah its simple 
 I had some Red Dog hand it over 
 TwistSeething I walk the circle I called out long ago 
 But somehow I get lost each time 
 Feeding this hunger deep inside that never lives 
 The voice within eats me up inside 
 One I love hurting you 
 Two I love your pain 
 Three lets get together and play the sinners game 
 Four is for the torture and five is for the shame 
 Cause every time you want it I get off on this game 
 You wanted to play the coldness follows 
 This isnt a game your life Ill swallow 
 And I cant help but smile at your pain 
 You wanted to play but I already won 
 Gloating I plant the seed inside your head right away watch it grow 
 Destroying your insides pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways 
 I watch the tears fall I crack a smile 
 I look at you and start to crack start to crack 
 I give into you take it back take it back 
 This lullaby is all you have all you have 
 Sadistic pleasure I attack I attack 
 I attack I attack I attack 
 I already won I already wonWith such ideals the world it at my feet 
 It seemed to stay that way a while kissing sweet defeat 
 Without its touch I fear Im meat 
 Standing here without a cause 
 Maybe its better this way 
 Silence my sweet releaseWhats your lie 
 Warm glance a fake smile 
 Eyes meet your mind runs wild 
 This game you play I like in a way 
 You expect to grab a child grab a child 
 You think Im innocent not wild 
 Take me lets see how much Im tamed 
 Everybody listen while I think of all I know 
 How to live for sure  body wall into my precious soul 
 Ill show you fears pleasure pain is my control 
 Let your body lay in there warm flesh to your fear 
 Warm lips a big smile 
 Hatred runs through your insides 
 This game you play  intimidation each day 
 You think its all a lie all a lie 
 They want to destroy your life 
 Anger twisted your life into pain 
 I wish I could take control 
 I wish I could let go 
 I wish I could break this mould 
 Inside Im so fucking cold

 Take me  lets see how much Im tamed 
 Everybody listen while I become all I know

 This ones real

 Whats comin whats comin whats comin on you x4

 GaspLies 
 Things keep ending up this way 
 Come and get off 
 Another notch is carved away 
 In the thoughts of mass decay 
 Funny how things end up this way 
 Beaten down dominated by its sound 
 Growing deep within my head 
 Softly dying its soul is shed 
 Eating me all up inside 
 This cancer finds everything I hide 
 Living my life horrified 
 Nothing will keep this pacified 
 And out my life 
 Lies 
 Does nobody know Im insane 
 Satisfaction is delayed 
 Its motivation is displayed 
 Finding its misogyny 
 Funny how I die and go away 
 Im constantly beat up inside 
 And Im the one to blame 
 No one can relate to me 
 Does nobody know Im insaneThe madness creeping up on me 
 The pressures building I foresee 
 Alienations lurking 
 Spawning lunacy 
 Slowly escaping 
 This wreckage in making 
 So dont look back for me 
 Sometimes we take it all 
 Nothing stands in our way 
 We have to fight and crawl 
 To die another day 
 Die another day 
 Misery often misleads 
 It creates things we cannot see 
 Excessive thoughts are bound 
 Distorting reality 
 This carnage in making 
 Hello are you there 
 How come wont you listen 
 I really dont care 
 Nothing will be the same 
 To die another dayAh 
 Each time I pull it apart 
 I get disgusted cant do it today 
 What makes it so good 
 That a man would kill for it 
 Lie just to lick a bit 
 To lie just to lick 
 Fake it you like it just take me away 
 Hold it just save it and Ill be repaid 
 To lie just to lick a bit 
 To lie to lick 
 Take it enlarge it became it before 
 Like it or hate it and Ill be justified 
 Why why what wha what for 
 Fake it then like it then like it again psycho 
 I look at you you look at me you look away 
 I look at you looking at me you look away 
 I look at you then you look at me then you look away 
 I look at you you look at me you look awayBoomerang Zoomerang Doomerang Up

 The sweeter the stroke the deeper the pain given 
 Your bitten bones as an angel angle sexdriven 
 Dangerous sex kitten warm as a mitten

 Make me laugh and Ill lay back and fade away 
 Let me go Ill be fine frozen here in time 
 Sick of being alive 
 Eaten up inside let me die go away 
 I never got what I wanted I never got what I needed 
 Whats on my mind Who can say 
 Its my infection Im feeding I cannot stop all this bleeding 
 Ill be ready give me the morphine and Ill go to sleep

 Listening to your twisted transistor 
 Hold it between your legs turn it up turn it up 
 The wind is coming through cant get enough 
 A lonely life where no one understands you 
 But dont give up because the music do 
 Music do music do 
 Because the music do and then its reaching 
 Inside you forever preaching 
 Fuck you too your screams a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor 
 Hey you hey you finally you get it 
 The world aint fair eat you if you let it 
 And as your tears fall on your breast your dress 
 Vibrations coming through youre in a mess 
 Hey you hey you this wont hurt a bit 
 This wont hurt a bit this wont hurt 
 Says who says who Anesthetize this bitch 
 Anesthetize this bitch anesthetize 
 Just let me be between you and me dont fit 
 Dont fit 
 Music do and then its reaching 
 Hang on you twisted transistorMy life is such a waste begging for something to work this time 
 But why cant I relate Feeling all I do is get whats mine 
 Holding on to faith never gave me nothing but despair 
 So why do I create just to be swallowed 
 I cant take we have a star 
 I cant take weve got a fantasy 
 Come what may we are the stars 
 I cant wait Ill take whats mine 
 Been hating all this time before I crawled inside 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 Been hating all this time too far to cross the line 
 I cannot take this place burning up inside this space of mine 
 But why cant I replace feelings I find hard to really find 
 I try but I cant taste 
 Memories they always fuck with me 
 All my feelings have been eating all of me 
 Feeling tired is there something wrong with me 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could findDu und ich 
 Wir haben keine Gesichter 
 Bald werden unsere Leben ausgelöscht worden sein 
 Glaubst du sie werden sich an uns erinnern 
 Oder werden wir durch jemand anderen ersetzt 
 Oh ich wünschte ich könnte sehen 
 Wie sehr ich mir wünsche ich könnte fliegen 
 Weit weg von den Sachen die über mir hängen 
 Zu einem Ort an dem ich heulen kann 
 Warum also kann es sein 
 Niemand hört mich rufen 
 Das Echo schallt zu mir zurück 
 Keiner von ihnen ist da 
 Mit all diesen namenlosen Gefühlen kann ich in meinem Leben nicht umgehen 
 Mit all diesen gierigen Menschen die versuchen zu fressen was mir gehört 
 Ihr müsst euren Hunger füllen und aufhören meinen Verstand zu ficken 
 Ich weiß dass es an der Zeit ist diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassen 
 Du und ich 
 Sie sehen uns nicht einmal mehr 
 Ohne Liebe wie sie es versprochen haben 
 Und kein Glaube an das was im Lager ist 
 Wo verstecken sich all diese Gefühle 
 Die in und außerhalb meines Verstandes tanzen 
 Verbrennen alles wonach ich mich ausstrecke 
 Stärken mich in meinem Niedergang 
 Wo bist du 
 Meine Seele blutet 
 Ich suche verzweifelt 
 bin ich blind 
 Ganz allein und gebunden für immer 
 In mir gefangen für alle Zeit 
 Ich weiß dass es an der Zeit ist diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassenIm the one that hurt you 
 Im the one who cares 
 Im the one looking down at you 
 Im the one whos there 
 What do you think Ive become 
 Im the one looking down on you 
 Where do you go when no ones there 
 And no ones thereAre you scared 
 Holding on to sacred places 
 Holding on to what is found 
 Im looking forward to see their faces 
 Flat on the ground the horror profound 
 None of you people mean shit to me 
 Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
 Smashed on the ground in your own debris 
 While choking on your blood from the sodomy 
 Burn the Obedient set yourself free 
 Walk the path of secrecy 
 Used to heartless mockery 
 A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes 
 Your misery 
 All the damage it just erases 
 Mediocrity all around 
 The grandiose disorder replaces 
 Conditions of peace is this my release 
 La La La 
 Burn the Obedient 
 Your miseryMust you keep looking at me 
 Before you looked the other way 
 Must you keep glaring at me 
 I know you look inside and see what you made 
 You took no pride in me 
 But now Im your everything 
 Its finding out ya own owe me 
 Not all of your gloating 
 Must you keep looking at me 
 Now you see what I am 
 Trust I knew what it was 
 I dont forget things thinking Im nothing 
 Pride of me 
 No Pride 
 Why x7 
 Must you keep looking at me 
 Before you looked the other way 
 Trust I knew what it was 
 I dont forget things look what youve made 
 Not all of your gloatingIn der Angst kann man leben wörtl Angst ist ein Ort zum Leben 
 Zeig mir das wahre Gesicht das du versteckstPain 
 Buried so far away 
 Enter my life of nothing 
 Sick of the same ol thing 
 I am so high always 
 Burying my life so slowly 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Cant face bottom without something 
 We enter in my head 
 With the world around me 
 Cant you feel this pain 
 Screaming a lie I Am 
 Cant you feel my eyes out 
 Cant you take my heart away 
 GoodbyeOh my God Im feeling crazy man 
 What could it be 
 As I walk into this place everyones staring at me 
 Somehow I feel Ive got a fuckedup disease 
 As I part the seas fingers come out pointing at me 
 Do I make you laugh Do you think Im funny ha ha or funny queer 
 Bitch get outta here 
 Let me make myself clear I dont give a fuck 
 All you people can suck my motherfuckin dick 
 Whats with the hostility why is it so provoked 
 Youre living in a fantasy thats how you cope 
 Go ahead kick the shit out of me it just fuels the comedy 
 Feel that youre superior I feel youre just plain absurd 
 Ridiculous vanity that is blurred 
 Oh my God this shit is crazy man 
 Look at this scene as I watch these stupid people act like they are machines 
 They should really all drop their knees 
 Oh the jealousy thats the one thing I guarantee 
 Do I make you laugh Do you think Im funny ha ha or funny queer shit 
 Get out of here 
 Go ahead kick the shit out of me it just fuels the comedyIm an animal 
 Im a victim 
 Im the answer to your prayers 
 Im a witness 
 On the witchhunt 
 Im the monster up the stairs 
 Im the ghost thats 
 In the mirror 
 Im everything that you fear 
 Im the riptide 
 Im the soul shock 
 Im the voice thats in your ear 
 Ive Seen It All 
 Still cant taste it 
 Smashed to the wall 
 That brought me to my knees 
 Ive done it all 
 Fuckedup 
 Wasted 
 Still in my blood 
 But now inside Im seen 
 Im the hunted 
 Im a predator 
 Im the answer to the riddle 
 Im the upbeat 
 Im the headfuck 
 Im the way off left to the middle 
 Im the player 
 Im the naive 
 Im the one whos not addicted 
 Im illogic 
 Turn the fuckup 
 Im the broken one who fixed it 
 Im just a child 
 With the tears in its eyes 
 I am holding this gift 
 That is broken 
 What do I have left now 
 Now inside Im seenMother youre holding my heart screaming Motherfucker 
 They left me broken bleeding 
 Son of the man you loved and left for 
 The son of a bitch who tried to show me Deaths door 
 Everythings illuminated everything is dedicated 
 Tried to leave this life I hated living it was overrated 
 Love song for the dear departed headstone for the brokenhearted 
 Arms to kill more flowers to steal 
 Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
 One sip of the blood that I found lying here Im dying here 
 Ash and obituaries rain down 
 And suddenly were lying naked face down 
 Whats it like decapitated Cant you see me fascinated 
 Youre the only thing Ive damaged only death can be mismanaged 
 Dont bring me Daffodils bring a bouquet of pills 
 Seeds of Geranium cracked to the cranium 
 Protect me when you can respect me when I am dying 
 Love song for the dear departed 
 Dont bring me Daffodils bring a bouquet of pills 
 Head stone for the brokenhearted 
 Seeds of Geranium cracked to the cranium 
 Protect me when you can respect me when I am dying 
 One sip of the blood that I found 
 Lying here Im dying here 
 Protect me when you can respect me when I am dyingOnly see somehow it always seems that Im dreaming ofsomething I can never be 
 It doesnt matter to me cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all my fantasies 
 I dont know your what name 
 So what Lets 
 Screaming to be the only way that I can truly be free from my fuckedup reality 
 So I dream and stroke it harder cause its so fun to see my face staring back at me 
 So what Lets  
 All day I dream about  
 All day I dream about  yes 
 All day I dream about  and 
 All day I dream about For every person Ive tried to be 
 Theres another dead inside 
 I love you so much Im never there 
 Im always with you but never cared 
 And you move in a hostile way 
 Like youre recently wounded 
 I reach for your wrists to feel a pulse 
 Youre feeling yourself for both of us 
 We got a problem its plain to see 
 We got a problem 
 Which one which one of you is into me 
 Which one which one of me is into you 
 Were both schizophrenic I fear 
 Say how many voices you hear 
 We are schizophrenic dont stop 
 No not till I fuck this all up 
 All the searching we do inside 
 Is a futile attempt to 
 Dissect what were meant to never know 
 Its all screwed up how the river flows 
 And I know that you tried real hard 
 To center yourself but 
 Was I the beast that sucked into you 
 A real dark bitch down inside of you

 Everybody was stoned even the mouse 
 Her from the whore house me from the jail 
 I just settled down to get a piece of her tail 
 When all of a sudden I heard such a clatter 
 I tripped on my dick and busted my bladder 
 I went downstairs and what did I see 
 A fat little red faggot hanging from a tree 
 He stuffed the stockings with reefers and beer 
 And a big fat hairy dick for the family queer 
 Thats the end of my story Funny wasnt it ysee 
 One two three four Santa can suck my dick all dayIn the deepest part of me 
 Like an unknown memory 
 I was never meant to find 
 Little seed of purity 
 And you dont belong to me 
 Still Im blinded by its light 
 Dont try to make it right 
 Does anybody know about love 
 Does anybody care about God 
 If youre with me sing sorrow 
 Penny for your thoughts I fear 
 We need a little help round here 
 When the scars dont ever heal 
 Do you fear youll never feel 
 What it is to be at peace 
 Youre craving a release 
 Why God would do me this way 
 I lived a life was always good 
 The one thing I need you take away 
 You take away 
 The one thing You take away 
 Just take away 
 The one thing Take away 
 One thing to take away 
 Away away 
 You took away my world 
 And all it left was pain 
 And all this time was for nothing 
 If youre with me sing sorrow

 And the demons they are creeping around 
 Take me I am sinking and my lungs are barely breathing as the angels put me into the ground 
 And everybodys peeking no one makes a sound 
 The shadows are deceiving paranoid and aroused 
 Slap me I am shaking and my guts are really aching 
 And the demons theyre laughing out loud 
 Spare me I am fading and my will is dissipating as the angels put me into the ground 
 My mind is debating these lesions Im making 
 This mess is sedating the power embracing 
 The bullshit Im facing my feelings Im hating 
 Reality is failing this shit is degrading 
 Reality its failing 
 This shit is degradingWake up its almost over 
 Something is taking me 
 Every time Im up it kills me 
 With a day to day shockwaves shatter me 
 I dont beg in security 
 Get up and dont look back now dont look back now 
 We ride a dying star across a burning sea 
 Were like a supernova now the fire is burning in me 
 Mass hysteria mass hysteria 
 Giving up I wont stop fighting 
 Bring it on it wont phase me 
 Any time it makes me stronger 
 Going on day to day stirring up the heavy sorrow 
 Why does life got be this way 
 Somewhere deep responding change 
 Manipulation rampant all around 
 Dark all these days calling on something to follow 
 Mass hysteria 
 Mass hysteria 
 We ride a dying star across a burning sea 
 Mass hysteria mass hysteriaGot to face your fear 
 Lying on the floor 
 Sleep into nothing 
 What the hell am I here for 
 So come on and play 
 Stab me in my heart 
 So long this time was wasted ripping me apart 
 We are the hurt inside your head 
 Lost in the void of what is dead 
 Constantly twisting things I said 
 Happiness is boring need pain instead 
 Its starting over 
 Starting over 
 Cant stand its over 
 God is gonna take me out 
 My time is over 
 This time is over 
 Why is this over 
 Crawling on the floor 
 All around this space 
 Talking to myself 
 What is this thing Ive got to face 
 Walking through a door 
 Has it been a waste 
 Going on and on thinking I could find my place 
 Cant stand its over 
 You cant see 
 Im torn away from you 
 And everything thats close to me 
 I cannot face the truth 
 Its nothing that I believe 
 Just run away from me 
 And thank me when youre free from me 
 Come take me 
 Happiness is boring need pain insteadMichael Hi there Is it okay if I come over and look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart Ive got a piece missing somewhere on mine and Im not sure what it is I want to see what you got on yours

 Sometimes I wish I could crawl in 
 I dont care what you talk like 
 I dont care how you dress 
 I dont care bout your facial features 
 I couldnt care less 
 I dont need conversation 
 Ive got nothing to say 
 I know what youre about 
 I want you 
 Inside out 
 I like the way your 
 ribs 
 contract 
 When you are lying on your back 
 The 
 bruises you internalize 
 eternalize 
 The thoughts behind those crazy eyes 
 Bitch so untamed but outside it a work of art 
 But underneath it youre beautiful when youre torn apart 
 Thats the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you 
 Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard 
 I drink the milk thats in your breast 
 I wouldnt even mind your shit 
 I put my tongue inside your ear 
 Im gonna eat you up right here 
 Inside outNas 
 Everybodys an enemy tellin me lies and its killin me 
 Why they all want to get rid of me 
 Everybodys my enemy several try to disguise the Devil in them 
 Wantin to get into my cerebellum 
 But Im ready and willin to tell them I cant f wit them 
 Excel so hard it got my chest swellin 
 Like my dick does watchin naked women do sick stuff on my porn collection on television 
 Trust nobody I dont know who to call a friend they all just pretend to be 
 Fuck everybody this is to all of yall cause everybodys an enemy 
 Watchin my own back strapped with chrome to my homies 
 Where the tombstones at Where the hoes at 
 Cause too many didnt act like dykes hermaphrodites with benzene a men 
 Look at the trash they writin they life and times is kinda wetter 
 Like the life and time of the sandman on Apollo theater 
 Imagine that from the black with a hook who pulls the whack talent off the stage 
 Im enraged 
 You fill your lies around me and you think youve won 
 You feel you can control me with the things youve done 
 You think that you can take me you think that you can play me 
 Youre gonna start to hate me I feel that youve disgraced me 
 Fuck everybody this is to all of yall cause everybodys an enemyWalking alone inside my world 
 Thinking Im doing the right thing 
 Destroying all that appears before me 
 It was all done in vain 
 Born again through fire 
 Born again through pain 
 Born again with violence 
 Born again with shame 
 Taking this place to call my own 
 Raping my body without a face 
 Tortured my soul is black as pitch 
 And I have no life to waste 
 I worshiped you 
 Do anything 
 So lost and helpless 
 I played your game 
 Born again with shameWhatcha gonna do 
 Whatcha gonna feel when suddenly I slip away 
 Almost I am a ghost of who I used to be yesterday 
 How you gonna touch and how will you collect the beauty 
 When it turns to dust 
 Everything we make the cells we generate are both of us 
 Please be aware that I am you nothing could be more certain 
 This aint the time the place for us to understand this life 
 Hold you in my arms I hold you in my gaze 
 Save you with my dying breath 
 Underneath this Earth Id resurrect your soul and nothing less 
 Sorry for the space if I could fill the void 
 An ocean wouldnt hold the love 
 And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough 
 I will protect you I will protect you 
 This aint the time this aint the place 
 I will protect you I will protect you I will protect you 
 I will protect you I will protect youLet me see let me see 
 How my life has been taken taken 
 This demon haunts me haunts me 
 Theyre waiting help me help me

 They are taking me away 
 Putting 
 Things in me what soul

 Theyre eating 
 Please help me 
 I can not live without them 
 They tell me this thing inside of me

 Im out of the stone 
 Repeat this process everyday 
 Nothings my own 
 The dreams that Ive grown 
 I wont control  throw away 
 I need to make the decisions 
 I need to make it right 
 I need to Lead The Parade 
 Or this shit will fucking take my life 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want to make it right 
 I want to pass this test 
 And complete my tormented life 
 This curse is my own 
 It follows me home 
 Its like a child that wants to play 
 The thoughts in my brain 
 The subconscious pain 
 Makes me think why do I stay 
 I need to make the decision 
 Or this shit will take my life 
 I want it to be right 
 I want to pass my test 
 And complete this tormented life 
 Im happy everything was wonderful 
 So happy its beautiful 
 I need to make it right 
 Im happy I knew youd make it right 
 Everything is wonderfulAll the lying and cheating will surely bite you 
 Dishonesty tears you apart and will eat you 
 All the anger and pain and the suffering and the shame and the voices in your brain will surely haunt you 
 Let the guilt go let the guilt go let the guilt go let the guilt go 
 I tell you one thing which leads to another thing then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings 
 Then my brain spins off of fucking everything 
 When this happens I cant break through 
 All the anger the pain and the suffering and the shame and the voices in your brain will really haunt you 
 Now we waste our lives away letting guilt lead the way 
 Im such a stupid fuck listening to my head and not my gut 
 Constantly thinking thinking thinking 
 And thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking 
 And thinking and thinking and thinking Im grieving 
 When this happens I cant break throughHow come whats wrong with you 
 Darling faces all come frowns 
 Lets do what devils do hang each other when no ones around 
 Why cant I torture you 
 Giving pain then you take it away 
 The little things you do simply I love your evil ways 
 Your ways your ways your ways 
 Prey for me I think I owe you an apology 
 Somehow you bring the violence out in me 
 Im just a shell of what I used to be 
 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me 
 This virus follows you 
 Nothings left youre dead on the ground 
 How can I covet you 
 Give you Hell and you cant rebound 
 My soul infected you blackened thoughts they run through your head 
 The little things you do simply I wish you were dead 
 Were dead were dead were dead 
 Prey for me 
 I think I owe you an apology 
 Somehow you bring the violence out in me 
 Goodbye so long wish I could stay but everything is all wrong 
 Everything is all wrong 
 Everything 
 Wrong wrong 
 Wrong 
 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for meThere you are alone 
 With no hope of ever having something to be proud of 
 Something earned without begging 
 Yes I know youre a person a person close to me 
 Who do you think you are What more do you want from me 
 Ball Tongue 
 You got the dykes off I think theyll mind me 
 The rag Im on we are justified 
 Congrats you just fuckedup my makeup and shit 
 What have they done for me 
 Why are you at home buried in your own self pity 
 Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me 
 Yes I know youre the person the person that took time with me 
 Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me 
 You have come to take from your buddy 
 You have never been so funky 
 The higgle got sick of me 
 Ah the dick is fine for the day 
 Your brother took it from me 
 Unidentified enemy 
 Come fuckin back to save us and gave up 
 Theyve come to deliver me 
 You are my brother When does our friendship end 
 You are my Im not gonna give in 
 How can you fuckin doubt me But not again 
 Ive driven right by my friends 
 Theyve taken the take above me 
 And youre a psycho monkey 
 Theyve come to enslave me 
 Theyve jacked themselves onto me 
 Your fuckin gangster signs 
 Theyve come not to save them but they take 
 Fuckin death to fuckin me 
 Youre all psychopaths 
 Beromes dead at the technodrome 
 Youre right hes dead tear gas dropped But who was it 
 It doesnt of the rhythm of the damn monger 
 Never die Never die 
 And then the man kept kickin me 
 He gets him on theyre cool 
 He wasnt dead and then they knocked him on the head 
 No more hes rid of you 
 And youre a dykeHear you calling hateful darling 
 Youre so sweet but you cant stay 
 Wont be easy cause you please me 
 Lifeless doll dressed up to play 
 Dont make something out of nothing 
 Till your dreams just slip away 
 Careful with me doesnt fit me 
 Just pretend for one more day 
 All along I thought I was wrong 
 Also its screamed across the room 
 All along I feel its strong 
 I feel it calling calling me too soon 
 Every time Im hearing whining 
 Drive this ghost away from me 
 Playful sinner wants me in her 
 Cant you stay away from me 
 Its good headache little fumblings 
 Like a message played for me 
 Hurt me tender one last bender 
 Going down so gratefully 
 I dont need you 
 What the fuck youre here for 
 Slam my fist against the door 
 Oh no dont go 
 Im gonna break it down 
 All of me is tied and torn 
 I dont need no 
 Is there right or wrong 
 Crush the day when I was born 
 What the fucks it for 
 I feel it calling me too soon 
 Calling me too soon 
 I dont need youLately things wont go my way 
 Lately everything is gray 
 It feels like something 
 It feels like nothing 
 So I came too far 
 To end up this way 
 Feeling like Im gone 
 Feeling theres No Way 
 So Im angry fuck today 
 Angers an only thing Ive made 
 No its nothing 
 To live this way 
 Hating fearing falling 
 To the place where people haunt me 
 I cant help but keep from falling 
 To the place where people call me 
 I cant wait to give them these feelings of hating 
 Keeping inside me for all to take 
 Picking at me 
 Theyre ripping at me 
 Ripping at me 
 To the place where people call me 
 Live this wayDont wanna be sly and defile you 
 I just wanna break this crown 
 But its hard when Im so run down 
 And youre so cynical narcissistic cannibal 
 Sometimes I hate the life I made 
 Pushing on I cant escape 
 Everything that comes my way 
 Is haunting me taking its sweet time 
 Holding on Im lost in a haze 
 Fighting life to the end of my days 
 Dont wanna be rude but I have to 
 Nothings good about the hell youve put me through 
 See that life that has come unbound 
 Fighting life to the end of my daysI dream of the past so I can break through 
 The walls I have built inside 
 The thoughts I cant grasp transparent see through 
 They constantly fight and collide 
 Id love to see a different world 
 A place where you cant find me 
 Feel me kill me my backs up against the wall 
 Your magic spell doesnt work anymore 
 Kill me kill me thats what youve got to face my friend 
 My friend 
 This aint the end 
 The end 
 Why cant I relax and let it be true 
 This world that I try to hide 
 Its kind of a mess too reckless for you 
 This place makes me feel alive 
 The call of the purpose is the change in behaviour 
 And that is all we can sense of the strangers 
 It gets on top of you and forces your perspective 
 Then you know it can feel it its as dark as you can get 
 You want it harder harder harder 
 Give it to you harder harder 
 You just want it harder harder harder 
 I dont think youll ever get it 
 The endI am watching the rise and fall of my salvation 
 Theres so much  around me 
 I thought it would be fun and games 
 It would be fun and games 
 Instead Its all the same 
 Its all the same 
 I feel the reason as its leaving me no not again 
 Its quite deceiving as Im feeling the flush made me bad 
 What does that mean to you 
 What does it mean to you 
 For me Its something I just do 
 I just do 
 I need to feel the sickness in you 
 Does it make me badIm walking on a razor blade 
 Careful not to cross the line 
 Every little step I take 
 Its punishment time 
 Now Im getting to the end of the blade 
 Slipping to the other side 
 Fighting to survive 
 Theres no tomorrow 
 Theres no today 
 Fight or flight 
 Im losing my mind 
 Heavy on the heart 
 Im hanging like a bat today 
 Crucified by design 
 Every little move I make 
 Now Im sleeping on a bed of nails 
 Theyre breaking through one at a time 
 Cause every little move I make 
 The punishments mine 
 I give and dont get 
 I try to my death 
 For something inside me 
 That makes me forget x4 
 Losing my mind x6Close your eyes fall asleep 
 Broken promises that you never keep 
 Drift away tonight just drift away tonight 
 We used to dream we used to laugh 
 No one could tell us that this would never last 
 This aint a love song I would never give you one 
 No more secrets no more lies 
 No more feelings or surprise 
 No more whispered words or lullabies 
 Go fuck your lies 
 Everything everything falls with us 
 Everything everything always does 
 Everything everything falls all apart 
 Ive given up its all I could take 
 My hands are shaking my body could break 
 I will be lonely now come on and take me out 
 I used to care I used to try 
 But whats the use it always ends with goodbye 
 This aint a love song Id never give you one 
 There is nothing in my head 
 These are voices in my head 
 There is nothing theres nothing in my head 
 All apart 
 These are voices in my headI feel you all around me 
 Your voice it surrounds me 
 You keep telling me what I want to hear 
 Youre beautiful so talented I need you we got a thing 
 You ever need something Ill be right there 
 Fear is a place to live 
 Rip off the mask from your head 
 Show me the real face that you hide 
 I see you from a mile away 
 Keep staring acting like you gotta say 
 You ever need something Ill be right here 
 Fake ass people surround me 
 Theyre always nice to begin 
 Digging their claws 
 Digging their claws right in me 
 Theyre always nice to begin but 
 I always get fucked in the end 
 I always get fucked in the end 
 Fake ass Fake ass 
 Show me the real face that you hideCome on step inside 
 And youll realize 
 Tell me what you need tell me what to be 
 Whats your vision you see 
 What do you expect of me 
 I cant live that lie 
 Hey 
 I sing my words 
 Im fucked at dealing 
 With your lifes dead bodies everywhere 
 You really want me to be a good son 
 You make me feel like no one 
 Let me strip the plain 
 Let me not give in 
 Free me of your lies 
 Inside my heart dies 
 Your dreams never have achieved 
 Dont lay that shit on me 
 Let me live my life 
 You want me to be something I can never ever be 
 Dead bodies everywhere 
 Dead bodies everywhereI am going insane this shit is all of a pain 
 I cannot maintain as the shit gnaws out of my brain 
 I wish you could be me and then yes you would see 
 How tired I am and how you get the best of me 
 At least you could look at me while youre raping me 
 You are taking my life and selling it 
 Why should I complain At least it helps my pain 
 I am very cool now and it doesnt blot my fame 
 I am going insane this shit is all of a pain 
 You fuckin pussyAll alone and coming down as my tears create a sea 
 Have I been awake so long that the devils nesting for me 
 Right now if you could see right now attacking me 
 Hold on desperately youll never get to me 
 Take a look around help me 
 I see this loser little face staring at me 
 Run away diseased and torn the depressions ecstasy 
 Have I been away so long that the devils coming for me 
 Looking for that special sound thats come for me 
 Its never gonna take me down please come for me 
 Please come for me 
 They are coming 
 They are comingDisgraced expendable we are not really real 
 A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade 
 Spewing bile atrocities bringing existence to its knees 
 I will manifest my sins and I will kill mercy within 
 Immersed in this hypnotic spell influenced by the hate that swells 
 Im not terrified anymore theres nothing left but open sores 
 Disengaged relinquish the reality Ive known 
 Im feeling like Im alienated from my own and I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade 
 Nothing left but open soresI 
 I am confused 
 Fighting myself 
 Wanting to give in 
 Needing your help 
 Skin cold with fear 
 Feel it when we touch 
 Outside I dont know you 
 But inside Im fine 
 Can you see it in me 
 Skin cold from touch 
 Each day confronted with what I have done 
 You pull me closer 
 I push you away 
 You tell me its okay 
 I cant help but feel the pain 
 I hate you 
 Why are you taken

 Michael Because the way you said its supposed to work off heat no Geri 
 Michael As it gradually warms up this muthafucker with the coil the spring opens it up 
 This has already done its job the only thing its job is to do is when your cranking the engine up after its been choked all it does is pull back then it cracks open just a pinch 
 Michael Oh God Youre a hard hard woman to live with 
 Geri What

 Geri My GodOh 
 Oh yo pretty ladies around the world got a weird thing to show you 
 So tell all the boys and girls tell your brother your sister and your mama too 
 Were about to go down and youll know just what to do 
 Wave your hands in the air like you dont care 
 Glide by the people as they start to look and stare 
 Do your dance do your dance do your dance quick mama 
 Come on baby tell me whats the word 
 Word up 
 Up up 
 Everybody say when you hear they call you youve got to get it underway 
 Its the code word 
 No matter where you say it youll know that youll be heard 
 Now all you sucker DJs who think youre fly 
 Theres got to be a reason and we know the reason why 
 You try to put on those Airs and act real cool 
 But youve got to realize that youre acting like fools 
 If theres music we can use it be free to dance 
 We dont have the time for psychological romance 
 No romance no romance no romance for me mama 
 The word up 
 Oh oh oh 
 Yeah 
 OhWoke up didnt choke up 
 Got my 9 and my rambo knife off the floor 
 Went to the bathroom and beat the rush 
 Yo who the fuck used my toothbrush 
 Went to my sisters room Yo bitch wake up 
 You stupid ass dirty ass nasty ass slut 
 Shot her in the leg shot her in the thigh 
 Kicked her in the pussy and punched her in the eye 
 Slapped her in the head stepped on her cord 
 Dont fuck around bitch word is bond 
 Went downstairs to eat with my folks 
 Ma you broke the fuckin egg yolk 
 Punched her in the chest got on her cheek 
 Then I made her scream like the bitch was a thief 
 Pops got mad cause Mom got licked 
 I didnt give a fuck so I shot em in the dick 
 Hungry ass fuck said my grace 
 Pop kept screamin so I shot him in the face 
 Ate my food found my coat 
 Mail man came so I cut his muthafuckin throat 
 Waiting for the muthafuckin school bus 
 I had a dream that I was hardPrecious fingers she knows how to hold the poison 
 Lick it dip it and for no particular reason 
 She crawls on the floor 
 Slides against door 
 Precious finger shows her blossom is in season 
 Doesnt matter shell be doin it her way 
 Doesnt care if its a 10 or a 2way 
 Every night every day 
 I never meant to show up here anyway 
 Im only fuckin you till the seasons change 
 Treasured deep between the places that you hold dear 
 Tempted her to act as if we are in love here 
 Lying across this chair 
 Fingers everywhere 
 Terrifying all the angels up above here 
 When you come be a good girl 
 Hold your breath make it last long 
 It is called 
 Death 
 The little death girl 
 Im only fuckin you till the seasons changeSick of all these things I tried sick of all these lies 
 Nobody cares youre just a bad man 
 Nobody wants you youre a dead man 
 Wake me from my darkest dream read me from my mind 
 No problem Ive got time to kill 
 Slave everyone Ive had my fill 
 Do what you say do want you want to 
 We rip apart the flesh and live to see 
 And look at all the faces along the way 
 The terror grips me close and holds me tight 
 And hope I get to die yet another night 
 Throw a wrench into my world throw me in the fire 
 Death come over to me one time we shouldnt get much higher 
 Slave everyone Ive got my fill 
 Dont get close to me safe for you 
 All this suffering left to do 
 And hope I get to die yet another nightMy wheels keep spinning backwards 
 Its spinning round and round and round 
 My heart cant sometimes take it 
 Bleeding till its broken down 
 Why cant someone fucking tell me 
 What the fucks going on 
 Why dont we love eachother 
 Constantly beating others down 
 And now I find it hard to live my own life 
 Pleasing everyone 
 While Im just dead inside 
 I wake up I cant breath 
 I grab my sheets real tight 
 What the fuck is happening to me 
 Damn right I cant live this life

 Chaos Lives in Everything 
 Trapped inside a dream 
 It all comes back to me 
 Get away from you

 Another way for me to kiss that frown

 Gonna rape you fuck you bitch frown 
 Sometimes I worry 
 Sometimes Im sorry 
 Sometimes I just want to beat you down 
 Sometimes I just want to kiss that frown 
 Im insane but now you gotta give it up to me 
 Life is wearing thin 
 My only pleasure is watching you give in 
 To pretend 
 All it got me was nothing in the end 
 To win 
 It just comes back to meIm thanking all thanking all the fucked people 
 Straight from my heart begging all the same people 
 Burning is the same evil somehow making me feel sane 
 Waiting all this time Ive got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my mind I can see before Im gone 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me all the hate thats breaking me 
 I realize Im taking everything and the shit seems to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me to a place I hate to be 
 All along I seem to make believe and the shit seems to follow 
 Im thinking of making all the fucked people 
 Pain from the start all my dreams are ripped apart 
 Thanking all the fucked people they are all the things Ive saved 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me all the hate thats breaking me 
 This time I feel it taking me to a place Im meant to be 
 Your life I hate 
 Oh God can I replay 
 This shit seems to follow this shit seems to follow 
 This shit seems to follow this shit seems to followFuck all that bullshit 
 You watch me play 
 I look away 
 Your lights turn bright 
 You found the light 
 Take off in space You and I 
 Youre gonna die 
 Wanna meet me why 
 I wish I had your strength 
 Inside your soul escapes 
 Cry into me 
 Give me something all right 
 The kids that die listening to me 
 You are alive 
 Take off in space You and IAway I see its going down 
 Today hoping in time 
 Well bury all this pain 
 And well awake something inside 
 We push our buttons far inside 
 We tear our hearts out 
 Then we fight 
 Hey I know 
 Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known 
 I cannot survive alone 
 Our lives were good in every way 
 Too late time after time 
 Our love just turned to hate 
 But we stay by each others side 
 I keep holding on 
 I feel Im where I belong 
 Every time we fight it feels so wrong 
 I feel so enslaved by my pride 
 Then we meet again 
 Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive knownDay after day its the same 
 Why do we play these games 
 Reaching out for something true 
 Questioning all that I do 
 Gotta get back gotta get back 
 Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks 
 Name of the game feel the pain 
 Look into my eyes and youll see no pain 
 Everything will come right back to you 
 Everything you put me through 
 I cant breathe 
 Will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My bodys weakness 
 Get out before its too late 
 You know its pulling me down 
 Why do I feel so alone 
 So close yet so far from home 
 One thing I know I believe 
 On until after they bleed 
 Sin is through sin is through 
 Coming on to me while Im coming on to you 
 Never look away never look away 
 Cause once you slip youre out of my way 
 Practice this one thing I say 
 Never let this get away from me 
 I cant breathe will someone see me 
 You know its pulling me down x9 
 Never give up never give up 
 Never turn away or Ill be fucking you up x2 
 Feel the pain feel the pain 
 I dont need a mask to see your pain 
 Youre coming on to me while Im coming on to you 
 Once you slip youre out of my way 
 You know its pulling me downSome deny  search for things that never come around 
 Do I feel like a fool 
 The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared 
 And I owe this all to you 
 Im feeling like Im sinking 
 And nothings there to catch me 
 Keep me breathing 
 What do I have to do 
 Why cant this hurt be through 
 Im going head onto 
 Something I know I will fail 
 Why cant this Kiss be true 
 Why wont you please let me through 
 I dont understand why you always push me away 
 Well last thing I would like to do before I go away 
 Is cry there next to you 
 Cry  talk about the good old days  where theyve gone 
 And now how much I hate you 
 I feel the blood drip off my body as it pools right there on the ground 
 What am I now 
 Why you always push me away 
 Why you always push me awayFeeling out of place 
 Something must be wrong 
 Emotions in my space 
 Tight grip holding on 
 I cant control the events around me 
 I cant console the stress inside me 
 And once I turn off my brain 
 I realize I am alive 
 Im trying to please 
 Everyone around me 
 Im down on my knees 
 The stress makes me bleed 
 It feels like theyre all stabbing me 
 Feeling out of place 
 Why must I hold on 
 Anger I can taste 
 Time itself is gone 
 You know You know 
 What the fuck do you want from me 
 I am just a human being 
 Living my life to please everyone 
 I cant do this anymore 
 Being everybodys whore 
 For once Im gonna stand up and please me 
  Being everybodys whore 
 Being everybodys whoreMy brother you love her but dont give up your instincts 
 Hang onto you know what theyll be gone fast as you blink 
 Theyre trained to seduce you suck you dry quick as they can 
 They tried to reduce you now youre barely a man 
 Oh my God how can you deny the flood thats flowing through you 
 Hey you youre saying that shes all that you desire liar 
 Hey you you think you can throw water on this fire 
 Liar

 Dont whimp up fuck her up 
 One more time slam that door 
 Liar liar liar liar 
 Oh my God how can you deny the flood thats flowing through youLets go

 Guess Ill lose you and that is a shame because Im over you 
 Over you over you over you over you over you over you lets go 
 Im taking over I wont be lead astray 
 Life doesnt last long I gotta get away 
 The solution I try to reveal but the question is how can you really be healed

 Gotta get away cant cant get away 
 Gotta get away cant cant get away lets go 
 Life doesnt last long I gotta get awayHey Im feelin tired my time is gone today 
 You flirt with suicide sometimes thats okay 
 Do what others say Im here standing hollow 
 Falling away from me falling away from me 
 The day is here fading thats when Im insane 
 I flirt with suicide sometimes kill the pain 
 I cant always say Its gonna be better tomorrow 
 Beating me down beating me beating me down down into the ground 
 Screaming some sound beating me beating me down down into the ground 
 Falling away from me 
 Its spinning round and round 
 Its lost and cant be found 
 Slow it down 
 Twisting me then walk away 
 So I pray Go away 
 Lifes falling away from me its falling away from me 
 Lifes falling away from me fuck 
 Beating me down beating me beating me 
 Down down into the ground 
 Screaming some sound beating me beating me 
 Down down into the groundIt hurts to breathe but I dont care 
 The weight of the world the thoughts I couldnt bare 
 The city sleeps Im making plans 
 The less you know the better understand 
 Then I look and see that place 
 It fools me every time 
 Digging deeper pulls me under 
 Am I wasting time Im next in line 
 I pace and fret my blood it burns 
 The reason we know but still we never learned 
 The clock stood still my legs grow weak 
 It says its done I beg it not to speak 
 But youre gonna youll remember youre afuckingfraid 
 Never wanna never gonna and your bed is made 
 Am I wasting time 
 Am I wasting time Im next in lineI am clearly broken and no one knows what to do 
 Pieces of the puzzle dont fit so I pound them into you 
 Itching is the pulse inside creeping up to come alive 
 Its just doing what its gonna do 
 Times are looking grim these days 
 Holding on to everything its hard to draw the line 
 Shut the fuck up get up 
 I cant wait to rip my eyes out and look at you 
 Peace through pain is precious specially when its done by you 
 And I Im hiding in this empty space 
 Tortured by my memories of what I left behind 
 Shut the fuck up get upThe hunger inside given to me makes me what I am 
 Always it is calling me for the blood of man 
 They say I cannot be this I am jaded hiding from the day 
 I cant bare I cannot tame the hunger in me 
 Oh I say I did and always searching you cant fuck with me 
 So instead youll taste my pain 
 The hunger inside given to me makes me feel alive 
 Always out stalking prey in the dark I hide 
 Feeling falling hating feel like I am fading hating life 
 Oh I say I did and always searching you cant fuck with fate 
 So instead youll taste my pain 
 You say your life Im taking always bothering me 
 I cant take this anymore Im failing always smothering me 
 You look down on me hey what you see 
 Take this gift from me you will soon be me 
 Nothing seems exciting always the same hiding hiding 
 Its haunting me its haunting me 
 Its haunting meThe hating its pulled inside of me 
 Theyre trying to test my sanity 
 Insinuating its all make believe 
 And theyre ripping the child within me 
 Cheating the time that I have left 
 Needing my soul cause thats the bet 
 Giving all that that I can give 
 Controlling my mind that is diseased 
 Holding my hate that is released 
 Scalding the hand that keeps me fed that keeps me fed 
 Fed that keeps me fed 
 Fed that keeps me 
 I feel it all come crashing down on me 
 I feel alone and torn apart 
 I wasted time to let it get to me 
 An angry mouth with a broken heart 
 Searching for something that is safe 
 Hurting my pride that is the test 
 Turning my anger towards your flesh 
 Rotting were hoping aint that bad 
 Spilling the blood thats on the bed 
 The hating its pulled inside of me 
 And theyre ripping the child from within me 
 No no noIm over it 
 You see Im falling in the vast abyss 
 Clouded by memories of the past 
 At last I see 
 I hear it fading I cant speak it 
 Or else you will dig my grave 
 You feel them finding always whining 
 Take my hand now be alive 
 You see I cannot be forsaken 
 Because Im not the only one 
 We walk amongst you feeding raping 
 Must we hide from everyone 
 Im over it 
 Why cant we be together embrace it 
 Sleeping so long taking off the mask 
 My fear is fading I cant speak it 
 Everyone 
 EveryoneAnger inside 
 You tell me Im a  and your harder than me 
 A cowardly manIm not doing great I feel like Im dead not thinking straight 
 Inside my body troubled full of hate 
 I had to let it out before its too late 
 Deep inside it can hide feeling so lost and betrayed 
 Why does this happen to me every time 
 Stuck in this place where I cant escape 
 Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 Why wont it fade 
 Outside I had to lie Im okay 
 I hope someday Ill stop getting pain 
 I guess this is the lie I have made 
 What am I doing I cant believe this 
 I have been hiding wanting to be less 
 Giving to people they take from me 
 Always theyre bringing drama to me 
 Look look at me now now 
 Feeling so lost and betrayed 
 I cant stand all of this fucking pain 
 Please God just go away 
 Please God just make them payYoure not the right one dumb damn rapper 
 On top you think youre bomb artista 
 But youre bent out of ooh right 
 Sometimes things might make me ooh ooh

 Ripping my insides each time I lay with you 
 Why 
  You bitch 
 Need to Need to Need to 
 Why do I in need toIm getting out Im leaving here Im kickin right through this door 
 I stole your girl who was my girl I always said shes a whore 
 Rush through accelerate from everything I hate 
 Now this is my kind of disaster 
 Break in and take what we want and then burn down the liquor store 
 Pick up our friends tell them Its on get in dont ask what its for 
 Subwoofer kickin in porn on the TV screen 
 These spinnin rims dont go no faster 
 We can drive all night and were not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 Just follow the light and were not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 Were flippin off the people who dissed on us thats just a game 
 Were throwin bricks right through their windows and then we drive away 
 And break this spin around new things I couldve found 
 We keep on changin our direction 
 Go past the school the church the places that caused us hurt were gone 
 If we keep movin forward maybe well forget where were from 
 Were gonna shake things up were gonna break it down 
 We fuel this car with our rejection 
 You can never go back not even if you wanted to no way youre in deep now 
 Youve been fuckin up real good lately one minute you come from zero go now 
 Just follow the light and were not gonna stomp on the brakes for no oneToo late Im dead 
 Precision planning 
 Extraction demanding 
 The best psychiatrist psychic soothsayers soothsayers 
 Analyzing my instincts 
 You got it all figured out 
 Too late Im dead 
 You should have said I would have hung around a little longer 
 Fuck everything everything everything 
 How could you love someone with what theyve done now 
 Done everything everything everything 
 Known everything everything everything 
 I made my bed 
 You should too belong 
 Right beside me 
 The beast is mad 
 The patients hanging out 
 The trees have all burnt to the ground 
 In this vicinity 
 Its a strange retribution 
 To be lying here so close to what I despise 
 Too late Im dead Ooooooooh 
 Too late Im dead too late Im dead 
 Too lateBirds are circling above theyre called back to a waiting glove 
 Oh why dont they fly away 
 Surely theyd have guessed by now there is no gun to shoot them down 
 And still they stay for what they say 
 Are they killing them with lies 
 Are they fighting for their lives 
 Killing them with thoughts scared theyll never get enough 
 Killing them are we killing killing every single feeling 
 Its a trained response 
 Birds are circling above theyre called back to a waiting glove 
 This sordid game it fears my name 
 I have worshiped some false gods Ive run to them like Pavlovs dogs 
 To hide my shame it fanned the flame 
 Were all preset to reset to dumb to dumb 
 Were all preset to reset to dumb were all preset to reset to dumb 
 Somebody told me once Beat them till they start to get used to it 
 Next thing theyre lining up 
 Are we killing them Are we killing them 
 Are we killing them Are we killingHere it comes once again 
 Irrational I give in 
 Paranoia expands within little voices start to begin 
 Everyones out to take your joy away constantly scheming to keep us at bay 
 Everyones plotting and they are just taking 
 You must make it stop make them pay 
 Sometimes I just take things way too far 
 Irrational feelings I just try too hard cause what goes up must come down 
 The problem is I have no bounds cause sometimes I just take things way too far 
 Reality is surreal wretchedness is all I feel 
 Now its really just a way God I hear the voices say 
 Woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo 
 The problem is I have no bounds cause sometimes I just take things way too farFeat Korn

 So Ill tell you what it feels like this time 
 I put my whole life and soul on the rocks 
 Trying to get jealous is just another bad experience 
 Fuck I wish a girl could love me too for once 
 You say hey you want to try something different 
 Now I see your feels werent always just for one man 
 Ya got my heart now tell me what ya plan do with it 
 Ya say you never loved me like that now you full of shit 
 SO THIS IS LOOOOOOVE x8 
 Well I feel fascist when I say bitch 
 But I thought that bitch was liking it when she sucked my dick 
 I didnt see that this was not any good for me 
 Fuck you just open your eyes and see 
 I want to tell you so bad but I cant find my lips 
 Every time I give you my heart I can feel it rip 
 You got my heart tell me what ya plan do with it 
 You say you never loved me like that now you full of shit 
 For love but not be loved 
 For the push and Ive been shoved 
 For the truth and thats a belief 
 For the gift I will never receive x3 
 SO THIS IS LOOOOOOVE x8I cannot ever find a way to throw these darkened thoughts away I need a place to hide 
 Its thrown in my face everyday guess thats the price I have to pay for whats inside my mind 
 Alive alive alive alive alive alive alive alive 
 I am alive I will never run away 
 Places inside my heart screams inside with pride 
 Once I cry now I wipe away the tears 
 Once I die now Im alive 
 Little things tempt me everyday cause the pain is how I like to play 
 Better not cross that line voices in my head have to be saved 
 Its something I cant throw away whats inside my mind 
 I find my time Im intertwined 
 Im falling in this place I thought I left behind 
 I find my time Im intertwined Feeling so alive 
 I find my time Im intertwined Feeling so Alive 
 Alive alive alive alive 
 Once I die now Im aliveIm plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred 
 Thats falling down at least they start to fry 
 Why cant I be removed take their places 
 Sometimes its better to eat their scars 
 These are the times of the waking liar 
 Hold him close or you will expire 
 Holding on to the place youre thinking 
 Total deceit 
 I like to lose hope 
 Recede and cope 
 Like a beautiful rape 
 These things arent they great 
 Im terrified by emotionless faces 
 Theyre all around me I want to die 
 Im fucking trippin out seeing traces 
 Of murderers covered in lye 
 I love the things that make you upset 
 The more you hurt the stronger I get 
 The more you hurt the stronger I get 
 Arent they greatIm feeling mean today 
 Not lost not thrown away 
 Just irritated and quite hated 
 Self control breaks down 
 Whys everything so tame 
 I like my life insane 
 Im barricading and debating 
 Who Im gonna kick around 
 Right now cant find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right now I feel it scratch inside I wanna slash and beat you 
 Right now I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 Right now I cant control myself I fucking hate you 
 Im feeling cold today 
 Not hurt just fucked away 
 Im devastated and frustrated 
 God I feel so bound 
 So when I feel the need 
 I think its time to bleed 
 Im gonna cut myself 
 A watch the blood 
 Hit the ground 
 You open your mouth again 
 I swear Im gonna break it 
 My God I cannot take it 
 Shut up shut up shut up Ill fuck you up 
 I fucking hate you I fucking hate you 
 I fucking hate you I fucking hate you 
 I fucking hate you 
 Shut up 
 Shut up shut upSometimes things get in the way my thoughts I cannot convey 
 Its all pointing straight at you 
 We hate loving everyday 
 Our lives twirled in every way I give it all back to you 
 I cant help this going down 
 I cant take this all my life is reckless 
 All our lies are dangerous but we fake our way through 
 Thats what we do we do 
 Sometimes things dont go away 
 In turn you just run away 
 Its all coming back for you betrayed life is in decay 
 Your thoughts you cannot obey 
 Right now whatcha gonna do 
 Thats what we do we do we do we do 
 We do we do we do 
 I hear the calling of the helpless stranger 
 Hes all alone and no one gets his anger 
 I feel this pain every time Im here with you with you 
 All the heartache and the fucked up insults 
 I find you begging on your knees I figured 
 This is how its supposed to be with you with you 
 I cant wait for your lies to be broken down 
 I gave you Hell 
 Thats what we do 
 Thats what we doSo so young 
 Raped but I dont realize 
 Small white legs broke the pain between her thighs 
 I see your pretty face smashed against the bathroom floor 
 What a disgrace who do I feel sorry for 
 Skin so cold how could someone steal a life 
 Save the blame wait I got some shit to say 
 Smashed and raped not again this is a real crime 
 What a pretty face who do I feel sorry for 
 Rape something now rips my heart and takes my soul 
 I wait too late now I feel hate inside 
 Take my soul away away 
 What a pretty face who do I feel sorry forStanding inside rotting away something inside of me has been taken away 
 Feeling my heart breaking in vain it wont get better now 
 When will this end 
 I cant seem to get away I feel Im here so you can play with my head 
 Theres nothing I can say I keep feeling like Im to blame 
 Hopeless inside alone as I wait brewing inside of me enduring this hate 
 The stress is rising and I cant seem to get away from you 
 Youre always trying and the lying always shines right through 
 My God I hate this always take shit 
 Can I let this go on 
 Why cant I break this 
 I just take this as this goes on and on 
 End when will this end when will this end when will this end 
 When will this end when will this end when will this end when will this end 
 When will this endAs it all falls down do I walk away 
 Or do I stand my ground and accept my fate 
 And theres the faceless cries that twist my every dream 
 And almost every night I hear the demon sing 
 Why are we going on this way 
 Why do we play these games in vain 
 Nothings gonna break it down and build us back again 
 So why did the path have to lead this way 
 Black is the soul thats led astray 
 Youre leading me to places I can never follow 
 Happiness is found in the darkest ways 
 And as I searched around I knew nothing but mistakes 
 And when you scream you push me so much further ahead 
 And when I leave I always walk right back again 
 And when you cry the tears are cleansing bitterness 
 Im out of time Im slowly dying give me back my life 
 Just give me back my life 
 As it all falls down do I walk away 
 Or do I stand my ground Theres nothing left to sayIll never love again Love again love again 
 I wont ever have to pretend Pretend pretend pretend pretend 
 Im never gonna love again Love again love again 
 Damn 
 I dont ever want to have to try and though I lie it never flies 
 I dont ever wanna have to die but deep inside the death it hides 
 And I never wanna clarify and justify so I run and hide 
 And I never wanna signify so I pacify all the hate inside 
 No Ill never love again 
 No I wont ever have to pretend 
 No Im never gonna love again 
 Never gonna have to try to pretend 
 Never never never 
 I dont ever wanna satisfy cause things inside are doin fine 
 I dont ever wanna multiply cause deep inside Im not qualified 
 Ill never love again 
 Im never gonna love again 
 No Never never never 
 Never never neverWhen you were here before 
 Couldnt look you in the eye 
 Youre just like an angel 
 Your skin makes me cry 
 You float like a feather 
 In a beautiful world 
 I wish I was special 
 Youre so fuckin special 
 But Im a creep 
 Im a weirdo 
 What the hell am I doin here 
 I dont belong here 
 I dont care if it hurts 
 I wanna have control 
 I want a perfect body 
 I want a perfect soul 
 I want you to notice 
 When Im not around 
 I dont belong here oh oh 
 Shes running out the door 
 Shes running out 
 She run run run run

 Whatever makes you happy 
 Whatever you want 
 I dont belong hereHate something sometime some way 
 Something kicked down the front floor 
 Mine 
 Something inside Ill never ever follow 
 So give me something that is for real Ill never ever follow 
 Get your boogie on get your boogie on 
 Hate something some way each day 
 Feeling ripped off again now 
 Why This shit inside 
 So give me nothing just feel and all the shit will follow 
 God thinks we will never see the light 
 God told me Ive already got the life 
 Oh I say 
 Each day I can feel it swallow inside 
 Something torn from me I dont feel your deathly ways 
 Each day I feel so hollow inside always beating me 
 Youll never see so come dance with me 
 Dance with me dance with me

 Got the life got the life got the life got the life 
 Got the lifeJonathan 
 I wanna bring up Amy Lee from Evanescence 
 Youre too sweet 
 Jonathan 
 We thought this would be a cool song to do together so um yall enjoy 
 Something lost and never seen 
 Every time I start to believe 
 Somethings raped and taken from me from me 
 Lifes got to always be messing with me 
 You wanna see the light 
 I try to every night all in vain 
 Both 
 In vain 
 Sometimes I cannot take this place 
 Sometimes its my life I cant taste 
 Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
 Youll never see me fall from grace 
 You and I were meant to be 
 A cheap  for me to lay 
 Feeling like I have no release 
 Part of meKeep knocking 
 No ones there 
 Near be felt 
 All alone 
 Ready to blow my head off 
 I feel like a whore 
 Dirty 
 Just wanna laugh again 
 Give it to me 
 You dirty little fuck 
 Dirty little fuck 
 You dirty little fuck I will take it 
 Dirty little fuck I will take it 
 Dirty little fuck I will take 
 You dirty little fuck it 
 Just wanna laugh againYou simply defy I cannot and look through the sky 
 We try it single file dig on me here is my denial 
 I cannot ever find something safe my tongue on the fly 
 I cannot live this way  floorin me well kick the PA 
 You wanna play with me 
 Im really gonna rock your world 
 You wanna come for me 
 Im gonna rock your world 
 You say everything is fine I cannot compete with the skies 
 My sickness crossed the line come and meet my fly through the sky 
 I cannot ever find you and me well make all the lines 
 Oh if they could see the play no one would wanna be me 
 So I fly take me 
 I cannot fly most people hate me 
 To fly away from this pain 
 Please take away please take away my PA 
 To fly away from this pain this pain 
 PA 
 Please take away please take away my PA 
 Please take away please take away myFeeding the fall I cant help but desire of falling down this time 
 Deep in this hole am I making 
 I cant escape falling all this time 
 We come to this place falling through time living a hollow life 
 Always were taking waiting for signs 
 Hollow life 
 Fearing to fall and still the ground below me calls falling down this time 
 Ripping apart all these things I have tried to stop falling all this time 
 Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky 
 Search in vain asking why 
 All alone where is God looking down 
 We dont know 
 We fall in space we cant look down 
 Death may come peace I have found 
 What to say Am I alive 
 Am I asleep Or have I died 
 Haunting me 
 We fall in space 
 We cant look down 
 Something takes a part of me 
 What to say 
 Am I alive Am I asleep 
 We fall down 
 Search in vain asking why 
 Death may come peace I have foundYou came into my life 
 Without a single thing 
 I gave in to your ways 
 Which left me with nothing 
 Ive given in to smiles 
 I fell for all your games 
 I wish so bad right now 
 I hadnt let you in 
 Wont you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now 
 The sea of life 
 Youre just a minnow 
 Live your life insecure 
 Feel the pain of your needles 
 As they shit into my brain 
 I scream without a sound 
 How could you take away 
 Everything that I was 
 Made me a fuckin slave 
 Your face that I despise 
 Your heart inside thats grey 
 I came today to say 
 Youre fucked in every way 
 As they shit into my mind 
 You stole my life 
 Without a sigh 
 You suck me dry 
 NOW 
 You suck me dryIts the really new way you hold your head 
 Its like insanity is hanging on a thread 
 The flesh feels cold underneath your nails 
 And the look you give me never fails never fails 
 I love the way you hurt me 
 I love that you dont care 
 My love is dark and twisted 
 And I scream when youre not there 
 Its the interesting way you pierce my brain 
 Its within my urges but never the same 
 I love it when you help me you crack a smile 
 The best is when you make it last a while last a while 
 Cant seem to get away 
 This ghost Ill never find 
 It haunts me till this day 
 I cant get back my time 
 And I scream when youre not thereMy life is such a waste 
 Begging on something to work this time 
 But why cant I relate 
 Feeling all like who is get whats mine 
 I cant take we have a start 
 I cant take we got a fantasy 
 Come what may we are the stars 
 I cant wait Ill take whats mine 
 Believing all this time before a crowd could side 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 Believing all this time too far to cross the line 
 I Cannot take this place 
 Burning up inside this space of mine 
 Why cant I replace feelings I find hard to really find 
 Memories they always fuck with me 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 Find find find find find find find 
 All my feelings have been eating onto me 
 Feed inside is there something wrong 
 With me 
 Find find find find find find findHate is all around 
 If you see what I see 
 Definitely somethings going on 
 These fingers pointed at me 
 The lying 
 The cheating 
 The hellish nights alone while I am weeping 
 Just searching 
 Love is Never Around 
 All the waiting 
 Betraying 
 The one thing I hold sacred in my life is 
 Left hanging 
 And Im Never Around 
 Let go 
 And I will truly be free 
 Just let go 
 Her mind really is the disease 
 So just go 
 Enjoy everything I received 
 So let go 
 And I will kill this unease 
 Lets turn this around 
 Ill look down on me 
 Now I see whats going on 
 Worrying about you all and not me 
 The prying 
 Just Searching 
 My mind is really the disease 
 Laughter 
 Hate is all around 
 These fingers 
 Pointed at me 
 Pointed at me 
 Her mind is really the disease 
 And I will kill this uneaseWhen its crying take me to a certain place which I dont often find 
 I see a family walking always thinking of being somewhere else in time 
 So I fall face down in a rut I cant seem to get out of 
 Please wake me 
 Please give me some of it back the feelings that I had 
 Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you it doesnt matter 
 Each time I wake Im somehow feeling the truth I cant handle 
 Lets get this party started Im sick of begging you 
 You make me feel insane which I did to you 
 Lets get this party started you make me feel insane 
 I want to be the one to make myself sane 
 Time is ticking it makes me feel content with what I have inside 
 Constant paranoia surrounds me everyone I see is out to get me 
 You make me feel insane you make me feel insane 
 I want to be the one to make myself saneSo youve seen Ive gotten this far 
 Please give me some place to rage 
 Im not trying to go there 
 So take me away 
 Every time I reach for love 
 Its taken away 
 Night So I play 
 Give me a sign 
 This is gay 
 Give me some patience 
 So I pray 
 Its time to die 
 Is that what I want 
 Give me some guidance 
 Taken it away 
 Scat Singing 
 Is that what I wantYou can see I fly 
 Disguised evil attracting everybody 
 You can see I tried this all for you 
 You can see I dispise all of you 
 Sometime somewhere 
 Deceit leads you no where 
 You try so hard 
 To be the super star 
 So come in with me 
 Take your under sun light set you free 
 Somewhere cant you see 
 Going on this way 
 Free youll never be 
 So you see I tried this all for you 
 So you see I dispise all of you 
 So you see Im trying something new 
 Take me away Take me 
 Take me 
 Take me away 
 Take me awayLodi Dodi we likes to party 
 We dont cause trouble 
 We dont bother nobody 
 Were just some kids who on the mic 
 And when we rock up on the mic 
 We rock the mic rightYou and me we have no faces soon our lives will be erased 
 Do you think they will remember or will we just be replaced 
 Oh I wish that I could see how I wish that I could fly 
 Far from things that hang above me to a place where I can cry 
 So why can it be No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me no ones there 
 To all these nameless feelings I cant deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine 
 Youve got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind 
 I know its time to leave these places far behind 
 You and me we have no faces they dont see us anymore 
 Without love as they had promised and no faith for whats in store 
 Where are all these feelings hiding Dancing in and out my mind 
 Burning up all that I long for speeding me to my decline 
 Where are you My soul is bleeding 
 I am searching am I blind 
 All alone and bound forever trapped inside me for all time 
 I know its time to leave these places far behindAll right stop 
 Collaborate and listen 
 Ice is back I got a brand new invention 
 Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
 Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly 
 Will it ever stop 
 YoI dont know 
 Turn off the lights and Ill glow to the extreme 
 I rock a mic like a vandal 
 Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle 
 Too cold too cold 
 Too cold 
 Dont you be talkin that shit 
 Dance 
 Bum rush the speaker that booms 
 Im killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
 Deadly when I play a dope melody 
 Anything less that the best is a felony 
 Love it or leave it 
 You better gain way 
 You better hit bulls eye 
 The kid dont play 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo Ill solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 
 Ice ice baby 
 Take heed cause Im a lyrical poet 
 Miamis on the scene just in case you didnt know it 
 My town that created all the bass sound 
 Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
 Cause my styles like a chemical spill 
 Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel 
 Conducted and formed 
 This is a hell of a concept 
 We make it hype and you want to step with this 
 DJ plays on the fade slice it like a ninja 
 Cut like a razor blade so fast 
 Other DJs say Damn 
 If my rhyme was a drug 
 Id sell it by the gram 
 Keep my composure when its time to get loose 
 Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 
 YoIll solve it 
 Check out the hook while DJ revolves it 
 Too fuckin cold 
 Too cold too coldThis broken soul x 17 
 II cant remember the day when I lie and cried 
 I miss the time the day though I try 
 To hide it from you 
 This broken soul I cant deny Arms growin cold 
 Nowhere to run no one to hold me 
 This Broken Soul x 2 
 I still remember the way 
 How you smiled as I cried you laughed I bled everyday 
 I could never get away from you 
 This broken soul I cant deny arms growin so cold 
 No one to hold me 
 I cant remember when 
 You and I we walk as friends 
 Never seen a foolish idea 
 How can these lies be a good bye now 
 I I will find 
 You in my way 
 A different pain 
 Took inside of me 
 I will find x 4 
 You in my way a different pain 
 Took the pride of me one Ill never hold 
 This Broken Soul x 8And along came something sacred 
 I never knew what I found 
 The demons dance around elated 
 Theyre hurting me 
 I put my wall up each day 
 You tear it down 
 I hide in my space 
 The space you found 
 And one of these days 
 Ill come unbound 
 The feelings I hate 
 Will finally drown 
 Falling awake in a nightmare 
 Images of horror abound 
 Thought I stumbled upon salvation 
 Hell I found 
 Well Ill never be the same 
 Its the greatest lie ever told 
 No Ill never be the same 
 I sold my soul 
 Will finally drownShit 
 All my friends drive a Lowrider 
 And the Lowrider is a little lower 
 Take a little trip 
 Take a little trip you and me 
 Ah yeah 
 Oh shit 
 Uh yepI wouldnt be angry if you just fucking cried 
 Your tears would arouse me refreshing my supply 
 The suffering is fading I scream into the sky 
 Repulsion invades me I say goodbye 
 Digging deep inside of me 
 Getting past this agony 
 I cant seem to get away 
 Another day rotting in vain 
 I wouldnt be angry if things would stay the same 
 Youre fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain 
 Another day rotting in 
 I cant take this 
 I cant fuck this 
 I cant fake this 
 Another day rotting in vainSo I think you are a fool hanging on my every word 
 Its getting ugly so what Im ugly 
 Tear me from your heart tearing me apart 
 So I thought youd disappear being alone is what you fear 
 Are you lonely Yes lonely 
 Rolling and throwing consoling everything that goes this far 
 Joking and hoping revolting all the shit thats who you are 
 Holding and scolding revolving 
 Peel it back reveal the scar 
 Loathing exploding controlling this is what you really are 
 The time is coming gone insane 
 Youre feeling happy youve won the game 
 The time is coming a bed of flames 
 Your life is over and youre to blame 
 Youve gone insane 
 Youve won the game 
 A bed of flames 
 And youre to blame 
 Loathing exploding controlling this is what you really areRing around the Rosies 
 Pocket full of Posies 
 Ashes Ashes We all fall down 
 Ring around the Rosies 
 Into my childhood theyre spoon fed 
 One Two Buckle my shoe 
 Three Four Shut the door 
 Five Six Pick up sticks 
 Seven Eight Lay them straight 
 London Bridge is falling down 
 Falling down

 That thorn in my spine 
 Oh sure it feels fine

 All the chaos I have in my heart 
 Devils I make and the love can relate 
 All the solace inside tears me up 
 Take me away set me on fire 
 Theres no other way 
 Give me a reason cause I got nothing to gain 
 So what are we doing now 
 Feeling complacent I cannot be contained Im so lost and lonely now 
 Weaving deceit is so easy for me cause the loathing Ive had from the start 
 Evil disease all the hatred it breathes as Im down on my knees torn apart 
 Where do I run Where do I hide 
 Give me a reason to my end my life 
 Give me a reason to get out alive 
 So what am I doing now 
 What am I doing now 
 Feeling complacent I cannot be contained Im so lost and lonely nowI cant stand to let you win 
 And I dont know what to do 
 Feeling like a fool inside 
 Feeling all the love you hide 
 Thought you were my friend 
 Seems it never ends 
 I need somebody someone 
 Loved just for me 
 Giving you this and that 
 Giving gave me nothing back 
 All the things I do 
 Seeing all the things you tried

 Inside to help me out 
  
 I need somebody someone somebody somebody someone 
 SomeoneEveryones corrupt 
 You should just shut up 
 Let it go back off 
 The demon youve disrupted 
 Dont wanna talk about politics 
 Refuse to talk about politics 
 Dont make me talk about politics 
 Dont give a shit about politics 
 You wanna sleep with him to get to who you need to know 
 Think thats the way to go dont you 
 Dont you 
 Its in religion sex and everything we do and say 
 I look the other way Wont you 
 Wont you 
 Everybodys race 
 Lying to your face 
 Kicks you in the guts 
 Leaves you here all messed up 
 Tiny splinters are in your soul and they remain there 
 Darkest light in the deepest hole you sit and pray there 
 All the deals and the deeds youve done you wouldve never worked for 
 What you thought was so much fun youll have to pay for 
 Dont give a shit about politicsYou bumped into me 
 I was down and you took me up past the ceiling 
 You are the disease 
 Im the remedy that numbs all your feelings 
 You come lookin for me 
 Im the only one that keeps you sound 
 Bring it down to your knees 
 Cause Im the only that makes you you yyou 
 Please take me 
 Its the only way 
 You came after me 
 Im not worth anything if Im not inside you 
 Only you can truly see 
 All the hell you put me through and the vicious feeding 
 Cant really be free 
 Cause every time I run away you hunt me down 
 I cant ever blame me 
 Cause every time I turn around its you you you its you 
 I feel it dulling I feel it helping me 
 Its taking everything I love away from me 
 I feel it ripping I feel it scarring me 
 This shit has made me blind to all reality 
 I feel it calling 
 Its calling me 
 Go away away 
 Please take meI want a love thats right 
 Right is only half of whats wrong 
 I want a shorthaired girl 
 Who sometimes wears it twice as long 
 Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe 
 Baby Im in love with you 
 Im so glad you came here 
 It wont be the same now 
 Im telling you 
 You know you pick me up 
 From where some try to drag me down 
 When I see your smile 
 Replacing every thoughtless frown 
 Got me escaping from this zoo 
 So glad you came here 
 Wont be the same now 
 When Im with you 
 If I grow up Ill be a singer 
 Wearing rings on every finger 
 Not worrying what they or youll say 
 Ill live and love but maybe some day 
 Who knows baby 
 You may comfort me 
 Hey 
 I may appear to be imperfect 
 My love is something you cant reject 
 Im changing faster than the weather 
 If you and me should get together 
 Hey I know my love is yours to miss 
 That love is something Id hate 
 Ill make an early start 
 Im making sure that Im not late hey 
 For your sweet top lip Im in the queue 
 It wont be the same now when Im with you 
 And Im so glad you came here 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Dooda 
 Doodadoo 
 Dooda 
 Doodadoo 
 DoodaWalk away when youre angry 
 Brace 
 Brace yourself theres nothing to gain 
 Old 
 Old enough to know the outcome 
 Blood 
 More blood its always the same 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run headon 
 The God reserved for false alarm 
 Do what they say or they take it away 
 Id rather be dead than carry on 
 Wait 
 Bite your lip dont be cussing 
 We must 
 We mustnt take Gods name in vain 
 In vain 
 Blunt your knife pull the curtain 
 Impulse 
 Impulses you must refrain 
 So I carry on with this burden 
 I cant remember anything I cant be certain 
 Id rather be dead than carry onIm feeling mean today 
 My lifes not thrown away 
 I hate my life insane 
 Im barricading and debating who Im gonna kick around 
 Right Now 
 Cant find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 I feel it scratch inside I wanna slash and beat you 
 I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 I cant control myself I know I hate you 
 Not hurt just turned away 
 God I feel so bound 
 So what I feel the need 
 I think its time to bleed 
 Im gonna cut myself and watch the blood hit the ground 
 Cant find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 You open your mouth again 
 I swear Im gonna break it 
 My God I cannot take it 
 Shut up Shut up 
 Shut up Ill bust you up x6 
 I know I hate you x4 
 I know I hate you shut up x3 
 Shut upJonathan  
 Robert Smith 
 Well this is a very very special event for us especially what were gonna do right now 
 This band that we chose as our guest was a band that totally got me through high school 
 I could totally relate to what they sing about and the music 
 This band was basically the sound track of my life then 
 And this is Robert Smith from The Cure 
 I am watchin the rise and fall of my salvation 
 Theres so much around me such a lack of compassion 
 I thought it would be fun and games 
 Fun and games 
 Instead its all the same 
 Need to feel the sickness in you 
 I feel the reason as its leaving me no not again 
 Make me bad 
 Its quite deceiving as Im feeling the flesh make me bad 
 I feel the reason as its leaving me no not again 
 Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die 
 Yesterday away from you it made me want to cry 
 Both 
 Go on go on just walk away 
 Go on go on your choice is made 
 Go on go on and disappear 
 Go on go on away from here 
 And I know I was wrong when I said it was true 
 That it couldnt be me and be her in between 
 Without you 
 Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child 
 Yesterday away from you it froze me deep inside 
 Come back come back dont walk away 
 Come back come back come back today 
 Come back come back what cant you see 
 Come back come back come back to me 
 All I do is look for you I need my fix you need it too 
 What does it mean to you 
 What does it mean to you 
 For me its something I just do 
 I want something I need to feel the sickness 
 In you 
 Make me bad 
 Come back come back 
 Does it make me bad 
 Dont walk away 
 Come back come back come back today 
 Come back why cant you see 
 Come back come back to me 
 Without you 
 Make me badCome on 
 Save some for me its what I like 
 I wanna play you know its time 
 Something is calling I cant keep from falling 
 Come on 
 Its on 
 Now see its my fault angels stabbing me inside 
 Nothing changes just rearranges for me this time 
 I can never win my self I dont like 
 I dont like I dont like I dont like 
 You see its my fault angels stabbing me inside 
 This time This time 
 For me inside Put me inside 
 Hold me this time Put me inside 
 Its onWell look at this 
 I see clearly now 
 Look at this 
 I can feel it now 
 Happyness 
 Is seldom found 
 Pop A Pill 
 Im so damn happy now 
 Feeling things crawl on me 
 I need my fix today 
 This is way beyond me 
 I cant live without you today 
 Well look at this 
 I see colors now 
 It got ugly now 
 Pop my pill 
 You today You today 
 I dont care about anything around me 
 Even all the love that surrounds me 
 Beat me 
 Eat me 
 I dont care about anything 
 I do this to shut out the voice 
 Within 
 Within 
 I dont care about anything 
 You today You today You today 
 I cant live without you todayIm shrouded and sedated 
 Patiently awaiting for my mind to really come down 
 Im afraid of being hated 
 Cause Im so jaded 
 Not like everybody somehow 
 Trapped underneath the stairs 
 Dealing with the fears 
 Constantly its silent and loud 
 I am who I am 
 Theres nothing I can do 
 I try to hide it 
 And it keeps breaking through 
 I feel the world so different 
 Than any one of you 
 Remember who you are 
 Theres nothing you can do 
 Im constantly debating 
 Why Im always playing 
 Walking around with my head down 
 I dont want to be like anyone 
 What the fuck have I have done 
 To deserve this terror somehow 
 I feel this world so different 
 Im not like god 
 Cant hide what I am 
 Like it or not 
 I push it down comes back again 
 The medicine stopped working long ago 
 I have a problem inside has nowhere to go 
 Inside has nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to fucking go 
 Youre always stuck with you 
 Nothing you can do 
 Youre always stuck with youWell I wish there was someone 
 Well I wish there was someone to love me 
 When I used to be someone 
 And I knew there was someone that loved me 
 As I sit here frozen alone 
 Even ghosts get tired and go home 
 As they crawl back under the stones 
 And I wish it was something 
 Please tell me theres something better 
 And I wish it was something more than this 
 Saturated loneliness 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could steal it abduct it corrupt it but I never can 
 Its just saturated loneliness 
 Does the silence get lonely 
 Who knows 
 Ive been hearing it tell me 
 Go home 
 Cause the freaks are playing tonight 
 Theyve packed up and turned out the lights 
 And the bath waters cold 
 And this lifes getting old 
 And I wish I could steal it abduct it corrupt it 
 And I wish I could steal it 
 And I wish I could feel it abduct it corrupt it 
 But I 
 Never can 
 Never canIt looks like its about to begin Im lying down in a pool of sin now 
 So why does it look so good within 
 Letting go giving in 
 Tell me what you want tell me what you want 
 Fuck you go away 
 Fuck you go away go away and never come back 
 Im gonna try to dive right in Im gonna fight until I win now 
 Im rotting down in a pool of sin 
 Never come back never come back 
 Go away and never come back 
 Go away go away 
 Never come back never come backWhats it gonna be today 
 Keep chipping at my soul and why must it disobey 
 The only thing I loathe 
 How many times a day must I die 
 Nothings gonna work today 
 Im killing time looking all around to find a way 
 Its all wrong knowing that my demon won 
 Im done 
 Have I been lead astray 
 Blaming the righteous what do you think theyd say 
 Attacking the altar 
 Im done with faceless feelings 
 Im done with anything 
 Im done trying to support you and sacrificing everything 
 Everything everything 
 Im done
