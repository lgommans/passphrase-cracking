 Idiotic sense of yourself are you that dumb 
 Entire legion of me totalitarian 
 The one and only motherfucker top of the world man 
 Cause I cant stand it planned gonna crashland it 
 In other words consider me branded 
 Another version of me another version of you 
 Both barrels what you gonna do 
 All I hear is human noise 
 You made your own fucking choice 
 I belong to only me 
 Silence for my revelry 
 I can only die over time 
 Filthy hands stay away from mine 
 Every reason is a right to hate 
 Painful clutch death is fine give me mine 
 Only one of us walks away 
 Somebody explain this 
 You dont care cause you dont exist 
 What the fuck is this another joke 
 Reckoning 
 Walks away 
 Walks awayDid you never give a damn in the first place 
 Maybe its time you had the tables turned 
 Cause in the interest of all involved 
 I got the problem solved and the verdict is guilty 
 Man nearly killed me stepping where you fear to tread 
 Stop drop and roll you were dead from the getgo 
 Big motherfucker stupid cocksucker 
 Are you scared of me now Then youre dumber than I thought 
 Always is and never was 
 Foundation made of piss and vinegar 
 Step to me Ill smear ya think I fear you bullshit 
 Just another dumb punk chomping at this tit 
 Is there any way to break through the noise 
 Was it something that I said that got you bent 
 Gotta be that way if you want it 
 Sanity literal profanity Hit me 
 Spit it out 
 All you wanna do is drag me down 
 All I wanna do is stamp you out 
 Maybe its the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder 
 Keeping all your little spies and leaving when you realize 
 Step up fairy I guess its time to bury your ass with a chrome straight to the dome 
 You heard me right bitch I didnt stutter 
 And if you know whats good just shut up and beg brother 
 Backstab dont you know who youre dissing 
 Sideswipe we know the ass that youre kissing 
 Biggetybiggety bitchboy halfway hauser 
 Dont hear shit cause it keeps getting louder 
 Come up and you get a face full o tactic 
 Lipping off hard Going home in a basket 
 You got no pull no power no nothing 
 Now you start shit Well aint that something 
 Payoffs dont protect and you can hide if you want 
 But Ill find you coming up behind you 
 Bout time I set this record straight 
 All the needlenose punching is making me irate 
 Sick of my bitching falling on deaf ears 
 Where you gonna be in the next five years 
 The crew and all the fools and all the politics 
 Get your lips ready gonna gag gonna make you sick 
 You got dick when they passed out the good stuff 
 Bam are you sick of me Good enough had enough 
 Fuck me Im all out of enemies 
 All I wanna do is slice you up 
 Spit 
 Spit it outSitting in the dark I cant forget 
 Even now I realize the time Ill never get 
 Another story of the bitter pills of fate 
 I cant go back again I cant go back again 
 But you asked me to love you and I did 
 Traded my emotions for a contract to commit 
 And when I got away I only got so far 
 The other me is dead I hear his voice inside my head 
 We were never alive 
 And we wont be born again 
 But I will never survive 
 With dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 You told me to love you and I did 
 Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit 
 So when I got away I only kept my scars 
 The other me is gone Now I dont know where I belong 
 But Ill never survive 
 Dead visions in your name 
 Dead fingers in my veins 
 Oh ohIve known faces that have disappeared in time 
 Find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime 
 All my friends have pictures made to make you cry 
 Ive seen this and wondered what Ive done to calcify 
 I ignore you 
 As I close my eyes I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you 
 We all got left behind we let it all slip away 
 I cant stand to see your thalidomide robot face 
 I dont even try it 
 You had to be a liar just to infiltrate me 
 Im still drowning 
 Take this away 
 I can feel it on my mouth 
 I can taste you on my fingers 
 I can hear you like the holy ghost 
 And kill you if you get too close 
 We let it all slip away 
 We let it all slip away 
 Slip away slip away slip awayThe ghosts have given up 
 Familiar haunts have had enough 
 Too much thought will give you doubt 
 And now they found you 
 Its safer in a cage 
 They cant tell you what to say 
 All your dreams come with a price 
 So they own you 
 But what did you expect 
 Was it too much to protect 
 Did you understand they had selfish intentions 
 When they were pulling you in opposite directions 
 You dont know the hell thats coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 We are the override 
 Oh we are the override 
 The dead dont know the dead are lonely 
 A fascination fades 
 When this mercy execution 
 Says its over 
 You follow as preferred 
 Now their plans are undeterred 
 Who can bring them in to supersede 
 Its over 
 Even hate starts out as love 
 Sometimes when its all you want 
 Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted 
 When all thats left is the emotion you abandoned 
 Oh we are the override yeah 
 You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back 
 Floor to the pedal and lock what you act 
 Covered in sores you cannot be the one 
 You are the answer to why we have risen 
 You are not the way 
 You are judged to being afraid 
 You are simple and unchanged 
 We believe you should give up 
 Give up 
 God and his mercy will take you for granted 
 When all thats left is the life you abandoned 
 Give upFire and caffeine a lot of nicotine 
 Im gonna burn so I better tell you everything 
 The competition the superstition 
 Nevermind cause youre never gonna give in 
 Its a crisis just how you like it 
 The same drama in a different disguise 
 Im bound to walk with a target on my back 
 At least Im ready for another attack 
 The Lord of lies 
 The morning star 
 You had to be set free 
 Opposing sides 
 Your choices are 
 The negative one and me yeah 
 Svengali Why are we the enemies 
 I never follow but I never make apologies 
 Your dementias are gonna getcha 
 Because your walls cant support each other 
 Settle for the cynical youre so political 
 Youre getting ready cause the first move is critical 
 Reciprocity somebodys listening 
 What did we learn from our time in captivity 
 The negative one and me 
 I hope you live to see the day 
 When youre world goes up in flames 
 And as you die you see my face 
 Youre the only one to blame yeah 
 Fuck 
 Yeah 
 The prescient the nascent the quotient 
 they all will fall 
 The cystic symbolic condition 
 systemic 
 Egregious replete with these lesions 
 contaminate 
 Succumb to the selfish creation 
 your failure 
 No accountability divisibility 
 I point a finger but its always looking back at me 
 The centipedes pulling on the mechanism 
 Unearthing scars of the cataclysm 
 When the innocent begin to circumvent 
 The colour fades but the picture is vibrant 
 What do you believe Does it matter now 
 Turn away the killer is disavowed 
 Youre the only one to blame 
 the lord of lies 
 the morning star 
 opposing sides 
 your choices are 
 The negative one 
 the negative one 
 YeahI am fur covered in bloodThe whole thing I think its sick 
 The whole thing I think its sick 
 The whole thing I think its sickOne two three 
 Drop it 
 Bones in the water and dust in my lungs 
 Absorbing archaic like a sponge 
 The ultimate way is the way you control it 
 But can you stay if you detach your soul 
 Bury the present and squeeze out the past 
 The ones who endear to never last 
 Chemical burns and the animalistic 
 Im just another hardline pseudostatistic 
 Can you feel this 
 Oh can you feel this 
 Im dying to feel this 
 Im dying to feel this 
 Blood in the paper and skin on my teeth 
 Trying to commit to whats beneath 
 To find the time is to lose the momentum 
 You learn the lessons and immediately forget them 
 Automatic and out of my reach 
 Consult all the waste to find the key 
 Minimal life and the polysyllabic 
 Im just another blank page push the button pull the rage 
 I am all but what am I 
 Another number that isnt equal to any of you 
 I control but I comply 
 Pick me apart then pick up the pieces 
 Im uneven 
 I am the damaged one all my life and the damage done 
 Im dying to feel this Im dying to feel this 
 YeahYou are wrong fucked and overrated 
 I think Im gonna be sick and its your fault 
 This is the end of everything 
 You are the end of everything 
 I havent slept since I woke up 
 And found my whole life was a lie motherfucker 
 Shallow skin I can paint with pain 
 I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain 
 Everyday its the same I love you hate 
 But I guess I dont care anymore 
 Oh fix my problems with the blade 
 While my eyes turn from blue to gray 
 God the worst thing happened to me today 
 But I guess I dont care anymore Wrong 
 Fuck 
 You are wrong fucked and overrated 
 Think Im gonna be sick and its your fault 
 My flaws are the only thing left thats pure 
 Cant really live cant really endure 
 Everything I see reminds me of her 
 God I wish I didnt care anymore 
 The more I touch the less I feel 
 Im lying to myself that its not real 
 Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal 
 Its never gonna appear anymore 
 Youre wrong and overrated 
 Suffer 
 What the hell am I doing 
 Is there anyone left in my life 
 What the fuck was I thinking 
 Anybody want to tell me Im fine 
 Where the hell am I going 
 Do I even need a reason to hide 
 I am only betrayed 
 I am only conditioned to die 
 I havent slept since I found out 
 My whole life was a lie 
 NoShes sticking needles in her skin 
 I turn with an ugly grin 
 Her canvas doesnt leave a lot to fantasy 
 But her peace of mind cant stay inside the lines 
 Its so confusing the methods that shes using 
 She knows she shouldnt leave a mark that I can see 
 Will she ever find one million of a kind 
 Its cold and lonely but thats because she told me 
 Lost inside her dirty world 
 No one hurts this pretty girl but her 
 Oh shes beautiful 
 A little better than a man deserves 
 Ooh Im not insane 
 Please tell me she wont change 
 Maybe I should let her go 
 But only when she loves me 
 She loves me 
 How can I just let her go 
 Not until she loves me 
 Shes drowning in herself again 
 My God what a lovely sin 
 I guess theres nothing left to do but have my way 
 She can feel its right so she doesnt close her eyes 
 She smiles and answers it doesnt seem to matter 
 Lost inside my dirty head 
 Something tells me Im the one whos kept 
 Loud so volatile 
 A little better than her mind defiled 
 Who I need to be 
 We were meant to be together 
 Now die and fucking love me 
 We were made to hate each other 
 Die and fucking love me 
 Die and fucking love meThe whole world is my enemy and Im a walking target 
 Two times the devil with all the significance 
 Dragged and raped for the love of a mob 
 I cant stay because I cant be stopped 
 Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us 
 I know youre all tired of the same old bosses 
 Let me tell you how its gonna be 
 Im gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me 
 Welcome to the same old fucking scam 
 Same old shit in a dead fad 
 Everybody wants to be so hard 
 Are you real or a second rate sports card 
 They all lost their Dad or their wife just died 
 They never got to go outside Shut up 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 It doesnt change the fact that you suck 
 We are 
 The anticancer 
 The only answer 
 Stripped down we want you dead 
 But whats inside of me youll never know 
 Bipolar gods 
 You know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And I dont think I need this anymore 
 Now Im not pretty and Im not cool 
 But Im fat Im ugly and proud so fuck you 
 Standing out is the new pretension 
 Streamline the sickness halfassed aggression 
 You gotta see it to believe it we all got conned 
 All the mediocre sacred cows weve spawned 
 Put your trust in the mission 
 We will not repent this is our religion 
 I am hated 
 You are hated 
 We are hated 
 Everything sucks and I can prove it 
 Everybody dies shuffle on remove it 
 Individuals indispensable 
 Im the paradox deity vessel 
 The other side holds no secret 
 But this side is done I dont need it 
 Before you go you should know youre breaking down 
 Youll be rotten by the time youre underground 
 Fuck you 
 The source of conscience 
 Distorted sentients 
 Theres only one thing left 
 And I cant leave until its sated 
 The absolute 
 Controlling you 
 Theyre closing in I cant escape 
 I am hatedKill Me 
 Tattered and Torn 
 Thats where my soul is worn 
 Thats when I was born 
 I broke away from me 
 I knocked me to my knees 
 I drink my own cells 
 A decomposing well 
 Roaches in my head 
 I become the living dead 
 Torn 
 Tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt 
 Tearing myself from the things that made me hurt 
 Tearing myself from the things that made me hurtBurn 
 Pentex sucks Pentex sucks 
 They burn the life force of my tribe 
 Pentex sucks 
 Bonegnawers suck bonegnawers suck

 All bonegnawers suck 
 Pentex breeding night is darkening 
 The Black Hand sucks the Black Hand sucks 
 Those wyrm tainted bastard leeches Black Hand sucks 
 If I had my way If I had my way 
 Id rend them all ripped and torn 
 All that sucks dies 
 Sweet smell bleeding glow is melting me

 Confession I wont tell you twice 
 Decide either die for me or give up any chance you had of being free 
 The only thing I ever really loved was hurting you 
 Stay inside the hole let me take control 
 Dominate 
 You are nothing more you are something less 
 Parasite 
 Something has to give something has to break 
 Omnipresent 
 Fingers in your skin let my savage in 
 You deserve it 
 You deserve it 
 I wanted you 
 Was hurting you 
 Youre mine 
 I know who you areTheres God 
 Can I feed you again 
 Will I have to stay dumb 
 You can feel and it begins 
 But I know inside this heart attack 
 I can see through your eyes 
 Im terrified of everything 
 But its no real surprise 
 Because the parasites are dancing closer 
 All this sacrilegion warns in posters 
 Can you handle it 
 In the dark 
 Why I think Im alone 
 I swept through my visions 
 Im going too cold 
 Today is a tragedy 
 In the mouth of the mad 
 But that doesnt matter now 
 Ive come home relaxed 
 Im curled up in a ball and shaking 
 Im hiding from the hell Im making 
 I cant believe the chance Im taking 
 Is there any other way 
 The burden 
 You cant save me 
 There is nothing more to give 
 I am changing 
 Almost like I never lived 
 Be my witness 
 Just dont leave me in suspense 
 Keep this prove it 
 Tell them all the consequences 
 Have you ever been burdened before 
 Was there anything you wanted more 
 Our same plea 
 By now you know that looks are deceiving 
 Im covered in a rash and receding 
 For Gods sakes weve suffered 
 This pain is now our lives 
 For Gods sakes weve suffered enough 
 Enough 
 EnoughDestroy 
 Too tragic to stay with you 
 Too static to try for you 
 These scars they swallow hard 
 The part of the past thats hollow and dark 
 Too horrid to kill for you 
 Too sordid to die with you 
 Unstable as always come down 
 Everything else is just dust and sound 
 Separate 
 Ive lost my only way 
 Ive lost my only way 
 See the shape broken and thrown away 
 Id give it all away come take it all away 
 You cant resent the fear 
 Somebody tell me how I got here 
 Id give it all to you 
 Come take it its all for you 
 The noise is so damn loud 
 But everything else is just dust and sound 
 I dont wanna do this anymore 
 Everythings shit 
 Everythings been taken Forsaken 
 Gotta start it over cause Im hearing it backwards 
 Dont make sense dont feel better 
 Whos better Its not that simple 
 You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult 
 Its not a word its a problem the problem was easy 
 Draw your conclusions Solutions 
 Everybody else wanna run 
 Contorting distorting I am undone 
 One less propaganda nightmare fixture 
 Are you getting the picture 
 Im broken and thrown away 
 YeahThou shalt not 
 Kill your fathers destroy another life 
 Question everything we clung to for years 
 Live forever design a better death 
 Confuse a liar with a savior from fear 
 Create a myth and separate the chosen ones 
 Adolescent independence dominion 
 I only wanna believe in fuckin anything 
 But now my conscience is contradicting everything 
 The endings the same 
 The world will not change 
 The answer is clear 
 Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters 
 Blame yourselves because your children are mine 
 We are orphans but we are not forgotten 
 And we will find a way to save us this time 
 We can run but we are tired of runnin 
 Were droppin seconds in a glass til we die 
 We only wanna believe in fuckin everything 
 But were alive and were not accepting anything 
 The answer is clear 
 Annihilation 
 I wont control or restrain things I do not understand 
 Now I realize Im stronger better 
 They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had 
 Now I realize Im stronger better more 
 We have to save ourselves 
 We have to save ourselves 
 Oh I will never become another piece 
 Inside the paralytic construct I hate 
 Live forever Well I would rather die 
 At least Id know I wasnt theirs to create 
 This is yours but you had better choose 
 Before they take away your right to decide 
 I guess Ill never believe in fuckin anything 
 But my solace is I can handle everything 
 Obliteration 
 They gave to me now I give to you 
 The means to burn the thoughts I had 
 Now I realize Im stronger better 
 We have to save ourselvesYeah 
 I can see you but you cant see me 
 I could touch you and you wouldnt even feel me 
 Wait a second and youll settle down 
 Im just waiting till you really let your guard down 
 Youre relaxed youre sublime youre amazing 
 You dont even know the danger youre facing 
 If Im quiet Ill slide up behind you 
 And if you hear me Ill enjoy trying to find you 
 Ive been with you all day 
 Im trying to stay calm 
 Im impatient and its really hard to breathe 
 Im going to empty you and fill you in with me 
 Just keep the violence down 
 Not yet dont make a sound 
 Oh God Im feeling it 
 Its reaching fever pitch 
 My skin is caving in 
 My heart is driving out 
 No mercy no remorse 
 Let nature take its course 
 Watching Bring me to my knees 
 Waiting I am your disease 
 Lover Set my symptom free 
 Covered You cant stop me 
 Wait no wait wait no wait wait not yet no wait wait 
 Im sweating through my veins 
 Im trying to hold on 
 Its unbearable its almost worst for me 
 Im gonna tear you apart and make you see 
 Make you see 
 This is the virus the virus of life 
 This is inside us the crisis the knife 
 Its almost time to play 
 Its time to be afraid 
 I cant control the pain 
 I cant control in vain 
 Oh God Im ready now 
 Youre almost ready now 
 Im gonna love you now 
 Im gonna put you down 
 I see you in the dark 
 I see you all the way 
 I see you in the light 
 I see you plain as day 
 I wanna touch your face 
 I wanna touch your soul 
 I wanna wear your face 
 I wanna burn your soul 
 This is the virus the virus of lifeMeet the man that made me greet the can I came from 
 Motherfucking sacred heart of Jesus 
 Blew it in the back room feeling like a real goon 
 Slam the fuck aside man Im on youre not 
 I am the great big mouth 
 Burn 
 Good riddance though Im sad to say 
 I didnt get to kill you 
 Rhetoric better look both ways 
 I gotta get an arm through 
 Stain 
 What the fuck is up Get the fuck away 
 Run if you want to 
 Innocent Youre a guilty conscience 
 I jam that blade through 
 Prepare you fucker 
 Even though I wont ask him 
 I dont give a shit bitch 
 I dont give a fuck bitch 
 I dont understand this you dont matter 
 I dont give a fuck man 
 I dont give a shit man 
 I dont really care man 
 Im the supersized man 
 Fuck fuck You 
 Youre fucked 
 Fucking stupid fuck 
 Fuck Fuck Fuck 
 Stupid fuck 
 God fucking stupid fuck 
 Fuck Stop 
 Fuck stupid fuck 
 Take that motherfuckerI am the product of your conduct 
 The uncontrollable urges that made me 
 Have made us all Are you proud Do you even care 
 You taught us all to lie thats how we made it here 
 You shouldve buried the truth with your secrets 
 But you were far too impressed with your pretense 
 Now as far as I know I dont know anything 
 Cause you made damn sure I wasnt anything 
 Distractions reactions 
 The only way to go is to go away 
 Discarded retarded 
 Before I let you go you have to let me 
 Clawed away from human clay 
 We are the broken shards the art disarray 
 Before you condemn you rape them 
 Feed us meconium 
 Stunt our growth from our souls to our throats Cut 
 You shouldnt wall us up with your apathy 
 But you did now youre only growing enemies 
 This is the catalyst the alpha the first breed 
 Cause you made damn sure 
 Now were everything 
 Much to my surprise I will wake up 
 And follow the path of the ones I am made of 
 But this time I wont give in 
 I will save you from my sins 
 What is wrong with this manipulation violence chaotic 
 Ensconced in all thats wrong 
 I slam you shut I can only take so much 
 How many times do I have to mistreat you 
 Constantly biting my hand as I feed you 
 Maybe now youll understand severity 
 Ill sum it up with the best amount of brevity 
 Welcome to the transformation 
 Welcome to annihilation 
 Welcome to the man that wanted 
 Everything but couldnt have it 
 Save you from my sins 
 Save you from my sinsLets skip all the histrionics 
 Not again not another excuse 
 The epidemic is codependent 
 Biting off more than your mouth can chew 
 Dont forget to convalesce your secrets 
 I dont want to be a man today 
 For all you know Im the silver in the bullet 
 I am the trigger that will make you all obey 
 Im going to make you cry tonight 
 Im going to make you hate me 
 Inside all my flaws again 
 I cant let go 
 In spite of you Im lost again 
 I still dont know 
 Disguises show me what am I if I am only 
 The status quo is not a punishment but now it feels like home 
 Your association finds you guilty 
 Starting with the end of the day 
 Black and white is such a fascist feeling 
 Right or wrong and nothing to say 
 The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints 
 Unappreciated medical fiends 
 Confiscate another classic inbred 
 Fuck it all light the acetylene 
 No other choice I cant explain 
 Life keeps taking things away 
 The tough guys who came to kill but stayed to rape and ravage 
 The futures here Im past my prime 
 When the evidence came I committed the crime 
 Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible 
 Who could ask for a better disciple 
 Whats the point Im not sure I can 
 Ill never dig another grave Im afraid of what Ill find 
 If it hurts then youre too old 
 Ill take your shit and give you fucking gold 
 I need you to hate me 
 This life has shown me why am I here Sad and lonely 
 But now it feels like homeCycle of life and death supposedly 
 Goes round and round yet it stops with me 
 Glorious Hunter of my faith I have sinned 
 Killers are quiet like the breath of the wind 
 Filling the shadows with forms of my own 
 Raised by kindred of get I was born 
 Abomination world in disarray 
 Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae 
 Reflection beckons a portal shard 
 Spiritual quest I must stay on guard 
 Stepping sideways betweens worlds I shift 
 Killers are quiet when they are born with the gift 
 Beautiful anguish cast out by my race 
 Now one thats ageless I save my own face 
 I write my own laws with death I break bread 
 Killers are quiet when they come from my headCome on 
 Here we go again motherfucker 
 Come on down and see the idiot right here 
 Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care 
 Whats the matter with calamity anyway 
 Right Get the fuck outta my face 
 Understand that I cant feel anything 
 It isnt like I wanna sift through the decay 
 I feel like a wound like Ive got a fucking 
 Gun against my head you live when Im dead 
 One more time motherfucker 
 Everybody hates me now so fuck it 
 Bloods on my face and my hands and I dont know why 
 Im not afraid to cry but thats none of your business 
 Whose life is it Get it See it Feel it Eat it 
 Spin it around so I can spit in its face 
 I wanna leave without a trace 
 Cause I dont wanna die in this place 
 People equal shit 
 Whatcha gonna do 
 Cause Im not afraid of you 
 Im everything youll never be 
 Come on 
 It never stops you cant be everything to everyone 
 Contagion Im sitting at the side of Satan 
 What do you want from me 
 They never told me the failure I was meant to be 
 Yeah Overdo it Dont tell me You blew it 
 Stop your bitching and fight your way through it 
 Im not like you I just fuck up 
 Come on motherfucker everybody has to die 
 Come on motherfucker everybody has to die 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Goddammn rightIm cold Im ugly 
 Im always confused by everything 
 I can stare into a thousand eyes 
 But every smile hides a boldfaced lie 
 It itches it seethes It festers and breathes 
 My heroes are dead they died in my head 
 Thin out the herd and squeeze out the pain 
 Something inside me has opened up again 
 Thoughts of me exemplified 
 All the real flaws I have denied 
 Forget today forget whatever happened 
 Every day I see a little more overall deficiencies 
 Im nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this 
 I save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
 Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
 Way past good taste on our way to bad omens 
 I decrease while my symptoms increase 
 God what the fuck is wrong 
 You act like you knew it all along 
 Your timing sucks your silence is a blessing 
 All I ever wanted out of you was something you could never be 
 Now take a real good look at what youve fucking done to me 
 I havent got time for the living I havent got time for the living 
 Give me any reason why Id need you 
 boy 
 Give me any reason not to fuck you up 
 bitch 
 I see you in me I see you in me 
 I keep my scars from prying eyes 
 Incapable of ever knowing why 
 Somebody breathe Ive got to have an answer 
 Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures better things 
 But I dont care what you think youll never understand me 
 FuckDo you believe Do you fade like a Dream 
 Let me hear you breathe 
 Let me watch as you sleep 
 The sparrows eyes Promises shift into judgments 
 I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments 
 The blood and the body 
 Control the cut so its seamless 
 Show me your heart 
 Show me the way to complete this 
 Tethered to a scene I treasure can you help me 
 I sever God its perfect its never really perfect 
 Now I can finally be myself 
 Cause I dont want to be myself 
 Free my severed heart give me you I want it 
 I dont want to be myself 
 I cannot maintain 
 A semblance of normal anymore 
 Id rather feel pain 
 Than try to fit in with you anymore 
 Ill throw it all away 
 Like everybody else 
 I can finally be myself 
 I dont want to be myselfHit the goddamn wall 
 Into darkness 
  steeple 
  
 Its all  
 Be careful not to die 
 Reap for the way 
 Know whats in the way 
 Get this off my head 
 Not  
 Die with broken knees 
 I rip away 
 Rip away 
 I rip awayFuck you all 
 Running out of ways to run 
 I cant see I cant be 
 Over and over and under my skin 
 All this attention is doing me in 
 Fuck it all fuck this world 
 Fuck everything that you stand for 
 Dont belong dont exist 
 Dont give a shit dont ever judge me 
 Picking through the parts exposed 
 Taking shape taking shag 
 All this momentum is doing me in 
 And dont you fucking touch me 
 You got all my love living in your own hate 
 Dripping hole man hard step no fate 
 Show you nothing but I aint holding back 
 Every damn word I say is a sneak attack 
 When I get my hands on you 
 Aint a fucking thing you can do 
 Get this cause youre never gonna get me 
 I am the very disease you pretend to be 
 I am the push that makes you move 
 No 
 BurnIts been years since anyone could be a friend 
 Its the fear that kills the feeling in the end 
 Can we face it Can we shape it Can we really die 
 If rain is what you want all you have to do is close your eyes 
 Just close your eyes 
 I am watching resurrections start to crawl 
 Is there any chance in Hell Any chance at all 
 Do we need it Do we see it Is it really there 
 If rain is what you want then take your seats enjoy the fall 
 Enjoy the fall 
 The only thing deeper than my last breath 
 The only thing darker than my last death 
 Is the panic the static 
 Ive come back from the dead 
 But my cities will never sleep again 
 In these diamonds were left with coloured glass 
 As pressure takes its toll we will outlast 
 But you cant break my heart 
 As long as I can be myself Ill never fall apart 
 And you cant take me in 
 If Im not broken break me down 
 So I will never feel alone again 
 But my cities 
 will never sleep again 
 My cities will never sleep again 
 My cities will never sleep againBury all your secrets in my skin 
 Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins 
 The air around me still feels like a cage 
 And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again 
 So if you love me let me go 
 And run away before I know 
 My heart is just too dark to care 
 I cant destroy what isnt there 
 Deliver me unto my fate 
 If Im alone I cannot hate 
 I dont deserve to have you 
 Ooh my smile was taken long ago if I can change I hope I never know 
 I still press your letters to my lips 
 And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss 
 I couldnt face a life without your light without your light 
 But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight 
 So save your breath I will not hear 
 I think I made it very clear 
 You couldnt hate enough to love 
 Is that supposed to be enough 
 I only wish you werent my friend 
 Then I could hurt you in the end 
 I never claimed to be a saint 
 Ooh my own was banished long ago it took the death of hope to let you go 
 Oh oh 
 So break yourself against my stones 
 And spit your pity in my soul 
 You never needed any help 
 You sold me out to save yourself 
 And I wont listen to your shame 
 You ran away youre all the same 
 Angels lie to keep control 
 Ooh my love was punished long ago if you still care dont ever let me know 
 If you still care dont ever let me knowCome on 
 Somebody give me some light 
 Not pointed into dark 
 Somebody show me the end 
 Not trying to push the start 
 Im trying to figure out 
 A better way a better answer 
 But I keep finding all the problems 
 Ive been looking after 
 You can wander through the world 
 With nothing but a smile 
 Ill take your tongue for words 
 And use it to instill denial 
 Dont get close 
 You dont know me 
 And youll never know 
 Chivalry will get you somewhere 
 Rivalry will take you there 
 Maybe I should look away 
 Before I really miss 
 Maybe I should pick the time 
 Before I pick the place 
 I bet you all the things 
 That you emulate you penalize 
 But I dont wanna go 
 Until you learn to finalize 
 Rivalry 
 You ascertain the plot 
 My visions overshot 
 I have the best confection 
 I was gone for all the lessons 
 Who coined these words I use 
 Stay out and be abused 
 I didnt want to be 
 The undeniable source of everything 
 Youd better stay away 
 Waiting watching all the conflicts 
 Constrict just to fit in squeeze in 
 I cannot resist claws and fist 
 Remember remember 
 You take the rivalries 
 And never made much sense 
 I have the worst possession 
 What I want is so insensitive 
 Cause this is so confused 
 I only want to be 
 Left alone now run away 
 YeahIve felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you cant see 
 Inside my shell I wait and bleed 
 Ive felt the hate rise up in me 
 Good bye 
 I wipe it off on tile the light is brighter this time 
 Everything is 3D blasphemy 
 My eyes are red and gold the hair is standing straight up 
 This is not the way I pictured me 
 I cant control my shakes how the hell did I get here 
 Something about this so very wrong 
 I have to laugh out loud I wish I didnt like this 
 Is it a dream or a memory 
 Get outta my head cause I dont need this 
 Why didnt I see this 
 But Im a victim Manchurian candidate 
 I have sinned by just making my mind up and taking your breath away 
 You havent learned a thing I havent changed a thing 
 My flesh was in my bones the pain was always free 
 And it waits for youGently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure 
 A pleasure that will take my mind off the realities of my life 
 My past life 
 Life as I know it now 
 And whatever may come it slowly disappears 
 To somewhere in the back of my mind 
 And it will remain there till I wish to retrieve it 
 Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break 
 A break from the pressures of life 
 And everything that lay in the palm of lifes hands 
 Lifes hands 
 This mode is incredible Its out of this world 
 Too bad I must always leave it 
 Thats life 
 Thats Life 
 Shift Shift Shift Shift ShiftThis song is not for the living 
 This song is for the dead 
 With my face against the floor 
 I cant see who knocked me out of the way 
 I dont want to get back up 
 But I have to so it might as well be today 
 Nothing appeals to me no one feels like me 
 Im too busy being calm to disappear 
 Im in no shape to be alone 
 Contrary to the shit that you might hear 
 So walk with me walk with me 
 Dont let the symbolism kill your heart 
 Walk with me walk with me 
 Just like we should have done right from the start 
 Dont let this fucking world tear you apartKill it 
 Tattered and torn 
 Something aches 
 Bad things slither 
 My floors are burning down 
 And I cant find a window 
 This is medieval 
 This is cerebral 
 Suffocated 
 Melodramatic 
 Driven to the verge of 
 I make you my enemy 
 The nerves you sever 
 Can serve you better 
 In the blink of an eye 
 In the space of a second 
 Open my wrists 
 Give me my lessons 
 Tearing myself apart 
 From the things that make me hurt 
 From the things that make me 
 From the things that make me hurtIt appears that we have reached the Edge that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide 
 Forty years ago The Man proclaimed the Age of the Gross to be upon us and even though the 
 Man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence 
 That era has become very real 
 We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure 
 My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust 
 Some have fought and died 
 Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves dont care about 
 And will never understand 
 I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is 
 Not mankind 
  
 Distrust in information 
 Fundamentalism of opinion 
 Catastrophic boredom and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter 
 Where is your glory now people 
 Where are your gods and politicians 
 Where is your shame and salvation 
 You Rage For No Reason Because You Have No Reason 
 What have you ever fought for 
 What have you ever bled for 
 The face of the earth is scared with the walking dead 
 The age of the gross is a living virus 
 This is the future you have created 
 This is the world you have set ablaze 
 All your lies are coming true 
 All Freedom Is Lost 
 All Hope Is GoneI know why Judas wept motherfucker 
 The fires burn on the summit 
 Shining a light on the ones Ive killed 
 Survivors guilt undetermined 
 I can murder the world in all the blood Ive spilled 
 Banishment sequestered and conquered 
 To hell with your intelligence 
 Just figure out your common sense 
 No one is bulletproof 
 Ill eat the skins of my brothers 
 The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall 
 Can I fill in the cracks with these feelings 
 With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all 
 Selfishness take granted for everything 
 What more could you ask for 
 It doesnt matter anymore 
 Can you feel the cold 
 Fortune never favors the old 
 Tired of defending myself 
 Go complain to somebody else 
 Somebody else 
 The monsters in your madness are the voices in your head 
 Theyre scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed 
 You live like fucking heathens so youll die like pagan Gods 
 In between the poisons and the pure 
 Contagions and the cure 
 NINE  FOR  SURE 
 I got a bone thats dead inside of me 
 Its a rotting sink that I dont need 
 Feel free to vent your denigration 
 I cant believe Im saying this 
 Ill live with my regrets 
 Ill die by my decisions 
 Im not your fucking superstar 
 Keep it close youre going way too far 
 Bulletproof 
 BulletproofUndo these chains my friend 
 Ill show you the rage Ive hidden 
 Perish the sacrament 
 Swallow but nothings forgiven 
 You and I cant decide 
 Which of us was taken for granted 
 Make amends some of us 
 Are destined to be outlived 
 Step inside see the Devil in I 
 Too many times weve let it come to this 
 Youll realize Im not your Devil anymore 
 Under the words of men 
 Something is tempting the father 
 Where is your will my friend 
 Insatiates never even bother 
 You and I wrong or right 
 Traded a lie for the leverage 
 In between the lens in light 
 Youre not what you seem 
 Youll realize Im not your Devil 
 Im not your Devil anymore 
 Your station is abandoned 
 Fooled you cause I know what youve done 
 Sensation deprivation 
 You shouldve burned when you turned on everyone 
 So step inside see the Devil in I 
 I know youll find your answers in the end 
 Anymore 
 So step inside step inside 
 See the Devil in I see the Devil in IZero and zero is nothing but zero 
 The cancer and people conspired together 
 Running and running and going forever 
 Collected and sampled starving for zero 
 Come see my cage built in migraine 
 Come see my cage built in migraine 
 Minus the inside and minus the circle 
 Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel 
 And wherein and herein between us and near us 
 And zero and zero is nothing but zero 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Keeping myself alive through your 
 empathy 
 Let me go 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Leave me alone 
 Keeping myself alive 
 Keeping myself alive 
 Keeping myself aliveMy freedom is best whole countrys on house arrest and everyones a suspect 
 You cant feel the flow because you died facedown on a suicide 
 The motherfuckers on selfdestruct nobody guarding your back its all a front 
 Save this my rage is bliss Im taking names and getting pissed 
 Wheres Chuck D when you need him 
 You aint shit just a puddle on the bedspread 
 The maniac psycho Cool J screamed the shit but I still cant believe it 
 Man its funny that you scare me so just enough to fuck me up again and again 
 Hard life is hard as hell better back the fuck on up cause this is 
 No kind of life this is no kind of life 
 Ive got to get out 
 Its no kind of life this is no kind of life 
 You cant blame me 
 Cant be real no more your mask is skin and bone 
 Savor every flavor you got cause its not your own 
 Bad ass at bat man forget about the battle its the war we gotta win 
 Breathe ambercult breathe one more seethe freak like you got a pair 
 Wont be my fault when youre painted in the corner of a nogood life this is 
 I cant remember I dont understand is it malice that makes you this way 
 Carry it with you till someone forgives you I laugh cause theres nothing to say 
 You cant begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when youre here 
 None of us wonder what weather youre under youre making it perfectly clear 
 Lights aint on shit aint right never had peace but I gotta fight 
 Can you look in my eyes when my backs against the wall 
 Slash at my eyes surprise youll never get me 
 Youre all reality and sound bites and the freedom is never in plain sight 
 The feelings the question the price is too human for fucking sake this is 
 Its no kind of life this is no kind of life you cant blame me 
 I cant be I cant be I cant be blamedWallow in the winter of it 
 Discover what you truly covet 
 Underneath and far above it 
 You slither in all kinds of shit 
 How could you forget about it 
 Did you think you could minimize 
 This is the age of consent 
 Youll get a day in the sun before I kill your fucking lights 
 Burn up in your atmosphere 
 Burn up in your utmost fear 
 Desecrate your temples 
 Only Hell and hate remain 
 Dont look for crows to scatter 
 Prepare for Judgement Day 
 We are kill gods 
 The kings are falling down 
 Can I find a way to get there 
 Bury your head in the ground 
 Will you falsify for your fair share 
 When its done its done  plus negative one 
 Its everybodys guess but the apathy won 
 Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion 
 Or will you settle for oblivion 
 We 
 We make this world worth saving 
 Are 
 Are you prepared to believe 
 Kill 
 Kill everything that kills you 
 Gods 
 Live long and die for me 
 Rape crutch and stick in the middle 
 Of an evidence bag thatll never obey 
 All these years spent hiding all the bodies 
 I could never be sure but I remember the graves 
 You 
 Live long and die for meWelcome out 
 Mother Nature is a coward 
 Mother Nature is a whore 
 No more presence no more power 
 I pray for death by the hour 
 Cut another smile into me 
 Into me is all you are 
 My artifice wont recognize me 
 You wont find me 
 anymore 
 Posttraumatic war machines 
 The pessimists still wont believe 
 Throw away my past mistakes 
 Its all I can to feel 
 Let my weapons be your children 
 Let my armies be your damned 
 Try to suffer on in silence 
 Try to stop me if you can 
 Pneumatic destroyer 
 Pathetic seducer 
 Distortion sufficient 
 Someday one day well live our lives again 
 My ghosts have found their way back home 
 I have every right to kill my own 
 I have every right to kill my own 
 I am something now that never could exist 
 My anguish conquers all pay the price and watch me fall 
 My only key is brokenmy broken key is only Me 
 You utter waste of tired flesh 
 It doesnt matter if you cant progress 
 Even now they still create me 
 Give me your ignorance irritate me 
 I am made of the same debris 
 You want it all but you didnt want me 
 Hypocrite with no real use 
 Im alive whats your excuse 
 Well live our lives againPain 
 Here comes the pain 
 Enemy show me what you wanna be 
 I can handle anything even if I cant handle you 
 Readily either way it better be 
 Dont you fucking pity me get up get off 
 What the hell am I saying 
 I dont know about malevolent 
 Sure as hell decadent 
 I want somebody to step up step off 
 Walls let me fall fuck you all 
 Get a grip dont let me slip till I drop the ball 
 Fuck this shit Im sick of it 
 Youre going down this is a war 
 Fuck it 
 Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind 
 Youre leaving me suspect Im leaving you grotesque 
 Feels like a burn from which you never learn 
 Cause and effect you jealous ass 
 Press your face against the glass suffer 
 Go 
 Ive just begun 
 Its about that time gotta get mine 
 You cant kill me cause Im already inside you 
 Sick 
 YeahI play doctor for five minutes flat 
 Before I cut my heart open and let the air out 
 Three bugs a pound of dust 
 Some wind spilled before me 
 In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout 
 As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open 
 A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube 
 As I injected the candy heart that I selected 
 She said dont hesitate just do what you have to do to me 
 Its hard to stay between the lines of skin 
 Just cause I have nerves dont mean that I can feel 
 I wasnt very much fun to be with anyway 
 Just let the blood run red cause I cant feel 
 Biding my time until the time is right 
 Biding my time its time 
 Biding my time until the time is right 
 Biding my time 
 Biding 
 You 
 Someone in behind me 
 Someone inside me 
 Everyone against me 
 Everyone beside me 
 Clawing away the pieces 
 Scratching away the abscess 
 One more two more 
 Everyone once more 
 Inside the faces that I hide from you 
 I want to see you displayed before me 
 You are the only one that I would rather see 
 Before me 
 You want it you need it 
 Dont lie 
 I die you lie 
 I lie Oh why 
 I dont want you to pay anyone when I die 
 I wanna die 
 Id rather die 
 You purge 
 You burn 
 I dont need you anymore 
 I dont need you 
 No time 
 Lemme lie 
 Lemme die 
 No timeOnly when the fates commiserate 
 Do we get a little taste as unique 
 The libertine know what I mean 
 Hiroshima on a Sunday 
 You had a gift you were a gift 
 But theres always a goddamn catch 
 Blessing and a curse you made it work 
 The universe is so much smaller 
 Legend Bastard 
 Best friend Why 
 Why do the limits have to reunite 
 Hero Martyr 
 Mystery God 
 He was the best of us 
 The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you 
 The world will never know another man as amazing as you 
 Never be the same I want the blame 
 To be assigned to the guiltiest one 
 It cant be done because the son 
 Was the victim they arrested 
 Im so fucking pissed at all of this 
 You gotta know that you are sorely missed 
 Miracles are real they help you heal 
 They make you feel like things will get better 
 Father Brother 
 Scapegoat Why 
 Why did we only get this time 
 Fighter Icon 
 Sceptic God 
 Stop taking the best of us 
 I wont let you disappear 
 I will keep your soul alive if I cant have you here 
 History may have its share of lunatics and stars 
 But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you 
 The world will never know another man as amazing as you oh 
 Skeptic skeptic skeptic 
 Where am I supposed to begin 
 Im killing for the karma again 
 Feed the meter in the machine 
 Believing is the way to be saved 
 Gone 
 Are we alone 
 Were not alone 
 I cant let you disappear 
 We were meant to be the kings 
 Rule the masses run the risk 
 And keep our systems clean 
 The world will never see 
 will never see 
 Another crazy motherfucker like you 
 Like you like you like you like youGone I couldnt murder your promise right before my eyes 
 The revolution of my psychosis kept me outta the way 
 Once inside all I hold is ash 
 Fall suppressing every feeling 
 Im in so much pain 
 I have every fucking right to hate you 
 I cant take it 
 The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you 
 Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you 
 My 
 demise 
  I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery 
 I 
 deny 
  I fold but they keep on coming 
 Stop 
 Im always ready to die but youre killing me 
 Im always ready to die but youre killing me 
 Who are you to me Who am I to you 
 Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence 
 By default you are my only link to the outside 
 Psychosomatic suicide 
 Where were you when I was down Can you show me a way 
 To face every day with this face Goodbye 
 When I blur my eyes they make the whole world breathe 
 I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate 
 The one and only answer so much for memories 
 I wanna dress in your insecurities 
 And be the perfect you Im through 
 Im outstretched out for all to loathe 
 Here we go the ultimate irony 
 Killing me 
 Killing meShe seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities 
 So fragile yet so devious she continues to see 
 Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest 
 Enter the night that she came home forever 
 Shes the only one that makes me sad 
 Please get away get away get away 
 She is everything and more the solemn hypnotic 
 My dahlia bathed in possession she is home to me 
 I get nervous perverse 
 When I see her its worse 
 But the stress is astounding 
 Its now or never shes coming home forever 
 My imagination come alive come alive 
 Hard to say what caught my attention fixed and crazy 
 Aphid attraction 
 Carve my name in my face to recognize 
 Such a pheromone cult to terrorize 
 I wont let this build up inside of me 
 Oh Im a slave and I am a master 
 No restraints and unchecked collectors 
 I exist through my need to selfoblige 
 She is something in me that I despise 
 I wont let this build up 
 Wont let this build up inside of me 
 She isnt real I cant make her real 
 Real 
 She isnt real she isnt real 
 Cant make her real cant make her real 
 Cant make her realI push my fingers into my eyes 
 Its the only thing that slowly stops the ache 
 But its made of all the things I have to take 
 Jesus it never ends it works its way inside 
 If the pain goes on 
 I have screamed until my veins collapsed 
 I waited as my times elapsed 
 Now all I do is live with so much fate 
 Ive wished for this Ive bitched at that 
 Ive left behind this little fact 
 You cannot kill what you did not create 
 Ive gotta say what Ive gotta say 
 And then I swear Ill go away 
 But I cant promise youll enjoy the noise 
 I guess Ill save the best for last 
 My future seems like one big past 
 Youre left with me cause you left me no choice 
 I push my fingers into my eyes 
 If the pain goes on Im not gonna make it 
 Put me back together or separate the skin from bone 
 Leave me all the pieces then you can leave me alone 
 Tell me the reality is better than the dream 
 But I found out the hard way nothing is what it seems 
 All Ive got all Ive got is insane 
 All Ive got all Ive got is insaneI know you dont want to see 
 I know youre not part of me 
 But you wonder just the same 
 So Ill let you in on this game 
 Whats on top is just the beginning of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning 
 It never ends with the gifts Luna sends to the Apocalypse 
 On we defend for the right to live in a perfect world 
 For our past mistakes extinction we are hurled 
 Trying to make amends for the Impergium 
 As the Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm 
 You dont want to know 
 All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me 
 You dont want to see 
 Our viewpoint on what Hobbits are doing The black inside when frenzy is brewing 
 You dont want to feel 
 The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going 
 I wont let you be 
 Caught up in a war that you are not part of I sign this letter 
 Your father with love 
 Im trying to set my mind free Im sorry you never knew me 
 My soul is in recession 
 Painful to make this confession 
 Your father with love 
 LoveThe system has failed and you have failed with it 
 No time to care just time to say 
 Who gives a shit 
 My mind boils as Ive decided Im through 
 Fuck your position in life Im taking vengeance on you 
 I break down the walls of the political arena 
 Cast the vote on fnfal yeah well be seeing ya 
 Come on yall 
 I want to put a cap right in your asshole 
 You step to this youre gonna pass for a lump of dogshit in the grass now be on your way and get some class 
 Bitchslap 
 Man youre like a school in the summer no class 
 Chop down the bigwigs shoot the televisions too 
 My mind boils on life as Ive decided Im through 
 The guilty of crimes will be hung from the trees 
 Spit and punches arise from you and from meGive me the dust of my father 
 Stand on the face of the ancients 
 Bare the secret flesh of time itself 
 Follow me Ive come so far Im behind again 
 Follow me I wish so hard Im there again 
 Follow me 
 All that I wanted were things I had before 
 All that I needed I never needed more 
 All of my questions are answers to my sins 
 All of my endings are waiting to begin 
 I know the way but I falter 
 I cant be afraid of my patience 
 Theres a sacred place Razel keeps safe 
 Follow me Ive seen so much Im blind again 
 Follow me I feel so bad Im alive again 
 All of my endings are waiting to beginCome on 
 Watch those idiosyncrasies 
 Watch all the idiots follow me 
 Running out of ways to get outta the way 
 Take another shot just to stay the same 
 But I need some balance Back it off 
 Fill your lungs till it makes you cough 
 Tell me everythings gonna be all right 
 Cause I dont think Ill make it through the night 
 The only way is all the way 
 The only way The only way 
 Is all the way Is all the way 
 Is all the way 
 Oh my God 
 Its Judgment Day and Im not prepared 
 Everybodys out theres running scared 
 So take a little bit off the top 
 I dont care Just make it stop 
 I wont give another soul 
 to you 
 I wont give another life 
 You have to stop Stop Stop Stop 
 Do one thing and say something cryptic 
 But the styles always clash 
 One thing I know for sure hypothetical wont work anymore 
 One wrong move and they will pound 
 My nails are tight inside my wrists 
 This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental 
 Deity experimental Faith is accidental 
 I wont give another thought 
 I wont give any more of my hope to you 
 What What do you want What What do you wantPain made to order 
 Slipping slapping scatting on my back trying to relax 
 Thinking about the facts of the crack running through the pack 
 Division in thought about the war to be fought 
 For trying to mend the ranks still I get no thanks 
 They say they mean no disrespect but this is in effect 
 I take to heart the part I play everyday 
 Uninformed is one thing stupid is another 
 Keep running your mouth but dont call me brother 
 Im trying to find someone on my side cause banging heads all the time starts to grind at my gears and at my will 
 But persistent I am still 
 So when one insubordinate fucker tries to test me 
 Blow to the head then an entrail rend 
 Guts on the floor do you want more 
 Show you the strength of the tenth rank 
 Pain is the only way to teach kids these days 
 Opened your eyes Youve realized 
 Talk back to me Your punkass dies 
 Im all you know Where will you go 
 Valhallas gone with your soul 
 Only one of us walks the fuck away 
 Only one of us walks the fuck awayYeah 
 Insane am I the only motherfucker with a brain 
 Im hearing voices but all they do is complain 
 How many times have you wanted to kill 
 Everything and everyone say youll do it but never will 
 You cant see California without Marlon Brandos eyes 
 Cant see California without Marlon Brandos eyes 
 I am my fathers son cause hes a phantom a mystery and that leaves me nothing 
 How many times have you wanted to die 
 Its too late for me all you have to do is get rid of me 
 Its all in your head 
 Its all in my head 
 I tried you lied to me for so long 
 Everywhere I go theres a sense of it 
 Freak on my antics and give me a choice 
 Doesnt matter if a I give a shit its shit that you gave me 
 Do you wanna feel pain Taking my name in vain 
 Caring never felt so lame inside 
 Anybody else got pride Do you wanna take my life 
 Maybe Ill reverse my ride 
 Who the fuck are you Fuck you 
 Better suck it up cause you bled through 
 Better get away from me 
 Stay the fuck away from me 
 I feel safe 
 Seems youre saved 
 I feel safe safe 
 Look me in my brand new eye 
 Motherfucker 
 Look me in my brand newYeah 
 Black dirty teeth in the crease 
 Was the proof too good to be believed 
 Its the cunt with the tongue 
 Who belongs on broken knees 
 So far it occurs to me 
 That everybody in the world is afraid of me 
 Just one more sin and down we go 
 But that the news is out and I think Im going to 
 Kill myself or fuck myself 
 Or tell myself about the only thing that matters now 
 We bury what we fear the most 
 Approaching original violence 
 Is the silence where you hide it 
 Cause I dont recognize you anymore 
 To each his own 
 Life can do with one less watereddown excuse 
 If this is over you can tell me its no use 
 Use just tell me its over 
 Today we will deceive our better selves 
 Into assimilating pain from something else 
 Put on your face and show me why 
 Behind the scenes we had to simply comply 
 Now the community doesnt feel any better than it used to be 
 I wanna be a judge in a criminal case 
 You covered up did you cultivate 
 Be yourself not yourself 
 Know yourself cause no one seems to know you now 
 We carry what we cant control 
 In the silence theres a nihilist 
 Who doesnt care and never did 
 There comes a time when we cant take the same abuse 
 Use 
 Drug out pissed on everythings the same 
 Bitch and moan it doesnt matter nothings going to change 
 I dont wanna watch another brother fucking die 
 So discarded fallen by the side 
 Dont tell me its the only way 
 Just another reason why you never take the bait 
 The trials the scheming the burden of the beast 
 Both your faces turn your back on everything 
 You fought to save a dream 
 Now that its over 
 When this is over 
 We are the angels fear to tread 
 Were the silence well deny it 
 We cant continue on like this 
 There comes a time where we cant take the same abuse 
 My God it wouldve taken just one word to stay from you 
 Now that this is over you can tell me its no use 
 It doesnt matter what you say 
 It doesnt matter what you do 
 We cant continue on like thisHe can feel them turn 
 Spools of milky thread 
 Folding into thought 
 Seconds tick apart 
 You moulded it you made it you caused itreaction 
 You licked it you stole from it you lied to it now watch it die 
 You beat it you ate from it you spit on itretraction 
 You ignored it didnt explain to it you starved it now watch it die 
 Reversal Cant take anymore 
 Resolved to find a way to curb his skin addiction 
 To calcify his mind to find the ones who made him 
 Made him this way 
 Greasy winged uh causediaper breaking caw fuss I hear your dung falling 
 I hear your dung falling down 
 AffingI mean laughing 
 I mean affing at me Eyeing my dowNature 
 Fat jaws winter winter present present sniff 
 Sniff for the fifth timeis no time 
 Do I come do I go do they really seem to know 
 Gotsta get me some of that creamy filling 
 My assembly line of faces are waiting in a row 
 Stiff cold blue complexions that I used to know 
 Burn abide my yearbook for there I found no friends 
 But the ones I knew were shrinkwrapped in the end 
 Cant take any 
 Their feathers are my hair 
 Cant take anymore 
 Cant take anyOne

 Nil 
 Chaos Its just the beginning 
 Every promise I made Im rescinding 
 Center mass in the middle of the monster 
 Im getting tired of drowning the constant 
 Cry for help its debatable 
 The only reason that you love me is Im hated by all 
 Come on come see dysfunction 
 I guess were gonna leave it open for discussion 
 Who am I 
 And where am I going 
 Maybe Im looking in the wrong direction 
 Maybe Im looking for any direction 
 This is not my war 
 This is not my fight 
 This is something more 
 This is not my 
 life 
 Revolution 
 Convolution 
 Expectation 
 Desperation 
 Holed up scarred and tamed for the hell of it 
 Look at me I am the glorified malcontent 
 Save me Save this 
 All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven 
 Im sick of being the butt of the cosmic joke 
 And I dont get the punch line 
 A million people lined up for miles 
 To see the great big mouth shut up and apologize 
 This is not my life 
 Only reason to question why 
 Today I said 
 goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Oh I didnt need to leave to stay right here 
 Today Ill said goodbye 
 Im the pariah 
 Break me 
 I am the liar 
 Save me 
 I can take anything 
 Make me 
 Accuse me of everything 
 Kill me 
 Cut off the system 
 And slay me 
 Deny my existence 
 And waste me 
 I wont be afraid 
 Try me 
 I wont be unmade 
 Deny me 
 So come on Break it off 
 Come on Buy the lie 
 Come on Say it say it 
 Come on Say goodbye

 YesShe seemed dressed in all of me 
 Stretched across my shame 
 All the torment and the pain 
 Leaked through and covered me 
 Id do anything to have her to myself 
 Just to have her for myself 
 Now I dont know what to do 
 I dont know what to do 
 When she makes me sad 
 She is everything to me 
 The unrequited dream 
 A song that no one sings 
 The unattainable 
 Shes a myth that I have to believe in 
 All I need to make it real is one more reason 
 But I wont let this build up inside of me 
 I catch in my throat 
 Choke 
 Torn into pieces 
 I wont  no 
 I dont want to be this 
 She isnt real 
 Wont let this build up inside of me 
 I cant make her real 
 Wont let this build up inside of meScream 
 Fell forth destroy the source 
 I cant see and my voice is hoarse 
 Trying to wash your hands of us 
 But you should have known better than to leave us in disgust 
 Let me take you right to the point 
 All you ever do is dedicate in disjoint 
 That does it the time has arrived 
 Take it or leave it you better decide 
 You did it again 
 All you ever did was doubt 
 What do you want 
 Let me tell you what its all about 
 One life 
 Nine hearts 
 And eighteen hands thatll rip you all apart 
 Were here to decimate 
 To show you all we will never fall 
 And its gonna get serious 
 And critical 
 Dont stop because the feeling is terminal 
 Scream 
 Scream like you never have before 
 Scream till you cant scream anymore 
 Scream like your throat is bleeding 
 Scream till your heart stops beating 
 Scream for me 
 Get off of me and give the lie 
 Show the whole damn world this will never die 
 No matter how the energies scatter 
 Got to know nothing exists but the dream 
 Give it all 
 Till theres nothing left to give 
 Save it all 
 Quit saving you 
 If youre going to let the pain inside 
 Never under estimate the way you live your life 
 All our lives 
 All we ever sacrificed has paid 
 Everything 
 Everything is possible to me 
 Why no fate 
 Found everything that I had to take away 
 Save your life 
 Save it all that mean something to me 
 Why no fight 
 Found the thing I had to take away 
 Save it all and make a better way 
 This stress is a feeling that you cant compress 
 Everything your going through is total stress 
 Are you going to be a momentary run around 
 How will you handle their matter and prove you exist 
 YeahYeah 
 Im ethereal my children are legion serial 
 They stick to my skin like beloved cysts 
 I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists 
 Touch the hands of inverted saints 
 Follow my heart through the threaded pain 
 Callow man theres is a sentinel screaming 
 I see the future The future is bleeding 
 Yeah Yeah No 
 Sores every goddamn minute I can feel em now 
 Like a virus you will never kill me now 
 Going underground coming on like hepatitis 
 Were out and you cant reshape us 
 Another bug in the construct tearing up the Main Bus B 
 Zeros and ones are everything 
 execute me 
 Everywhere you look its like they know 
 Their fingerprints are hidden by control 
 This is where the line is drawn see 
 You cant take my soul away from me 
 Oh what do you need to see You feel the impact 
 Gotta retract everybody get back 
 What is this Its like a big conspiracy 
 Fields of dejected morbid progeny 
 They always say that its always our fault 
 But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt 
 Man its always the same if we talk or complain 
 We only wanna upset the balance 
 Hows it feel to be the new abortion 
 The only generation thats ever extortioned 
 No 
 You cant take my soul away from me 
 Everywhere you look its like they know 
 Oh you cant take my soul away from me 
 Fuck youContrite commercial arrogance leprosy 
 Consume the bitch the feckermindless like a child 
 For pitys sakeIve had all that I can take 
 We trybut in the end well see 
 There are no more codes 
 Only who is shit and whos still free 
 I was gonna change the world 
 With honor and aggression 
 No one listened no one cared 
 All they saw was misdirection 
 Go ahead and disagree 
 Im giving up again 
 I dont want you anymore 
 Fingerprint of God your new religions covet 
 This vessel wasnt built to last 
 But I will live forever youll never have to say Surrender 
 Because youre so part of it 
 My total honesty has no place for tomorrow 
 Guilty pleasures give me pain 
 Tell my people I cant follow 
 Youll never censor me youd better cherish me 
 My reason has a voice freedoms gone but well always have a choice 
 My present future tense it doesnt make much sense 
 Im coming after youfuck you all Im the only point of view 
 Violence and dollar signs another processed piece of shit 
 You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only cost 
 You cant delay the inevitable 
 Lostdont understand the incredible path 
 Im losing ground but I wont care when I go down 
 Im giving up againCome on over 
 Come unglued 
 Its not easy to see all of you 
 Help yourselves 
 Help is on the way 
 Well theres nothing to lose 
 So now I have something to say 
 Maybe we can all recognize a moment of sadness 
 Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view 
 A long time ago we believed and we were united 
 So the last thing on earth I am ready to do is say 
 Goodbye 
 A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us 
 This hasnt torn us apart so nothing ever will 
 How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us 
 But this moment will show us the rest of our lives 
 No one is going to save us this time 
 No one can know what were feeling so dont even tryI dont know why I never told you 
 And I dont know why I never tried 
 When we shed these bitter skins again Skins again 
 All the reasons come to life 
 And now its over 
 Now its over 
 I dont know why you never asked me 
 And I dont know why you never cared 
 When we hide these little sins again Sins again 
 All the reasons have to die 
 But now its over 
 And now its over 
 NoI have this one dutdut dat dutdut dat dutdut dat dat dat 
 Dutdut dat dutdut dat dutdut dat dat dat 
 Rise 
 Half alive and starkraving free and maligned 
 For encroaching on the purpose of this commercialfree interruption 
 Due to the prolific nature of this statement 
 Listener aggression is advised 
 It’s strange whenever I see a gun 
 I think about just how petty you are 
 And it blows my fucking mind 
 It blows my fucking mind 
 These days I never seem to get enough 
 Im tired of this shit I want to go home 
 Dont waste my fucking time 
 Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people 
 With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils 
 This planet isnt special collections made of clay 
 I’m waiting for the punishment I know is on my way 
 So cutcutcut me up and fuckfuckfuck me up 
 Cutcutcut me up and fuckfuckfuck me up 
 Irreverence is my disease 
 It’s second hand but you know me 
 The son of a bitch is on his knees 
 The last man standing gets no pity 
 Somewhere on a toilet wall I read the words 
 You form a line to formalize the former lies 
 And I finally saw the truth 
 Something so profound and it was sitting there 
 Surrounded by the garbage and the stains 
 Another victim of the refuse 
 Now Ive been saying this for years but you dont comprehend it 
 I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it 
 Androgyny and insults you try so hard to be difficult 
 You want to win the war Know what youre fighting for 
 With angel eyes and demon seeds 
 You’re missing what you really need 
 When all is said and done you see 
 Cutcutcut me up and fuckfuckfuck me upLiberate my madness 
 One of me all of you 
 Liberate my madness I just want to 
 Liberate my madness 
 Section off myself put a wall up what the hell have I done 
 Keep the dog at bay survive by saving me 
 Values and the game not a fuck up not a part of your lie 
 I am one I am all Im above and beyond 
 Stand off of the shit back off or Ill spit 
 So soft you forget 
 Your garbage in is garbage out 
 You dont give a shit I wont play the fit 
 Get off get on this 
 Liberate my madness 
 I am not ashamed what is vital isnt always humane 
 You can break in vain but you cant break away 
 Even in my face lotta bullshit not a lotta the truth 
 I cant see from here but I can smell your fear 
 Back off of the shit stand off or Ill spit 
 Saved Youre such a slave I dont expect a name 
 You dont care I wasnt witness 
 I cant be part of a system such as this 
 Hard eyes glow right in my darkness again 
 With the sickness renegade sisters blisters 
 Salivate litigate liberate madness sadness fuck this 
 How long have I had this 
 I dont need this outta my business 
 Insert engage betrayed my God 
 Fraud 
 Liberate my madnessGo 
 Stapled shut inside an outside world and Im 
 Sealed in tight bizarre but right at home 
 Claustrophobic closing in and Im 
 Catastrophic not again 
 Im smeared across the page and doused in gasoline 
 I wear you like a stain yet Im the one whos obscene 
 Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections 
 Ive got no time to lose Im just caught up in all the cattle 
 Fray the strings throw the shapes 
 Hold your breath listen 
 I am a world before I am a man 
 I was a creature before I could stand 
 I will remember before I forget 
 Before I forget that 
 Im ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt and I 
 Wear you like a stitch yet Im the one whos hurt 
 Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions 
 Ive got no right to win Im just caught up in all the battles 
 Locked in clutch pushed in place 
 My end 
 It justifies my means 
 All I ever do is delay 
 My every attempt to evade 
 The end of the road and my end 
 The end of the road 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah ohIm not what you think 
 Im not what you think 
 Or am I 
 Or am I what you think 
 You could never ever know 
 Please keep far away Far far away 
 Keep far away Far far away 
 Far away Far far away 
 I wont let you walk away 
 Without hearing what I have to say 
 That place in my mind 
 That space that you call mine 
 Is that space that you call mine 
 Got trapped in 
 So please just trust in us 
 Just trust in us 
 Trust in us 
 Us 
 Danger 
 We too feel alone 
 Weve too feel alone 
 Where have I been all this time 
 Lost enslaved fatal decline 
 Ive been waiting for this too unfold Good 
 My pieces are only as good as the whole 
 Severed myself from my own life 
 Cut out the only thing that was right 
 What If I never saw you again 
 Id die right next to you in the end 
 We too feel aloneHold on to something 
 I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound 
 Wanna push my face in and feel the swoon 
 Wanna dig inside find a little bit of me 
 Cause a line gets crossed when you dont come clean 
 My wormwood meets your pesticide 
 Youll never get out cause you were never alive 
 I am infinite I am the infant finite 
 Come a little closer and Ill show you why 
 No one is safe 
 Noises noises people make noises 
 People make noises when theyre sick 
 Nothing to do except hold on to nothing 
 How does it feel to be locked inside another dream 
 That never had a chance of being realized 
 What the fuck are you looking at 
 Ill tell you what youre looking at 
 Everyone you ever fucking laughed at 
 Look in my eyes for the answers typical 
 I can feel it underneath like a miracle 
 Everybody in the world needs more than 
 Lies and consequences to power them 
 Once again its me and no one else 
 I cant remember if there was a someone else 
 Its not mine its not fair its outta my hands 
 And its shaking Youll never take me 
 Nothing 
 Hate 
 Hate aint enough to describe me 
 Scream 
 Somewhere between screaming and crying 
 Im not supposed to be here 
 Im not supposed to be 
 Why 
 When do I get to know why 
 Bitter 
 Bitter as the stink of when I try 
 Pull your hands away 
 Im gone Goodbye Its so depressing 
 Withering away take a look inside My soul is missing 
 All I have is dead so Ill take you with me 
 I feel like Im erased So kill me just in case 
 So kill me just in case 
 Covet 
 Everything around mes mine 
 Sty 
 Cant see through the sties in my eyes 
 Down 
 Scratching and clawing all the way 
 Stay 
 You wont let me fucking stay 
 Live 
 Is there another way to live 
 Die 
 Cause its the only way to die 
 Im not supposed to beMy guilt and my shame 
 Always sell me short always feel the same 
 And my face and my soul 
 Always wear me thin always under control 
 But the longest hours youll have in your life 
 Are the ones you sit through to know if youre right 
 So Ill wait but Ill pray that Im wrong 
 Because I think I know whats going on 
 So let me get this straight The only will is my own 
 I do whatever I want and stay alone 
 All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted 
 Im gonna suffer for the rest of my life 
 But I will always find a way to survive 
 Im not a failure but I know what its like 
 I can take it or leave it or die 
 Stay you dont always know where you stand till you know that you wont run away 
 Theres something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur 
 Like breathing in sulfur 
 My life is undone and Im a sinner to most but a sage to some 
 And my gods are untrue Im probably wrong but Im better than you 
 And the longest hours Ive had in my life were the ones I went through to know I was right 
 So Im safe but Im a little outside 
 Im gonna laugh when Im buried alive 
 Like breathing in sulfur 
 Stay you dont always know where you stand You dont always know where you stand 
 Till you know that you wont run away 
 Theres something inside me that feels Theres something inside me that feels 
 Like breathing in sulfurMaze psychopathic daze I create this waste 
 Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways 
 Cant escape this place I deny your face 
 Sweat gets in my eyes I think Im slowly dying 
 Put me in a homemade cellar put me in a hole for shelter 
 Someone hear me please all I see is hate 
 I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it 
 Hands on my face overbearing I cant get out 
 Hands on my face overbearing I cant 
 Lost ran at my own cost fearing laughter scoffed 
 Learning from the rush detached from such and such 
 Bleak all around me weak listening incomplete 
 I am not a dog but Im the one youre dogging 
 I am in a buried kennel I have never felt so final 
 Someone find me please losing all reserve 
 I am fucking gone I think Im fucking dying 
 You all stare but youll never see theres something inside me 
 You all stare but youll never see theres something in you I despise 
 Cut me show me until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself 
 Knowledge in my pain knowledge in my pain or was my tolerance a phase 
 Empathy out of my way I cant die 
 I cant die 
 Despise depise 
 Purity 
 PurityThe State of the Nation violation 
 A broken promise is as good as a lie 
 The Hell is humongous the Devils among us 
 And we will burn cause we wont unite 
 What are we conceding for freedom 
 Why does anybody think we need em 
 I would rather fight than let another die 
 Were the problem but were also the solution 
 All hope is gone 
 If you want it come and take it from me 
 If you think you can you still dont know me 
 Let me tell you man I said it I meant it 
 And I will always have the right to defend it 
 Fifty seconds a hundred murders 
 The Bill of Rights 
 is a bill of sale 
 What will you do when the war is over 
 What will you do when your system fails 
 We have made the present obsolete 
 What do you want What do you need 
 Well find a way 
 When all hope is gone 
 Weve seen the fall of the elite 
 Bury your life take your disease 
 Well end the world 
 The wretched are the wounded 
 The hungry starve to death 
 In a place where no one goes 
 The air itself is a final breath 
 So discontinue 
 The antiseptic care charade 
 As the cry of justice comes 
 A malignant fire fades 
 I am the reason your future suffers 
 I am the hatred you wont embrace 
 I am the worm of a pure gestation 
 I am the remedy spit in my face 
 All your laws and rules are outdated 
 All your subjects are killing the kings 
 I can rattle off a million other reasons why 
 But does it matter when the only thing we love will die 
 well find a way 
 well end the world 
 When all hope is goneOur friends are all hurting 
 From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie 
 And still we keep hoping 
 To fix all the defects and strengthen these 
 Seminal 
 ties 
 We go on together 
 For better or worse our history is too real to hate 
 Now and forever 
 We stay until morning and promise to fight for our fates 
 Til we die 
 The start of the journey 
 Is every bit worth it I cant let you down anymore 
 The sky is still clearing 
 Were never afraid and the consequence opens the door 
 Ive never stopped trying 
 Ive never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood 
 Dont go on without me 
 The piece that I represent compliments each and every one 
 We wont be forgotten well never give in 
 This war weve achieved has allowed us to win 
 My last true confession 
 Will open your eyes Ive never known trust like the nine 
 Let it be spoken 
 Let it be screamed theyll never ever take us alive 
 Carry on 
  
 Well never be broken we wont be denied 
 Our war is the pressure we need to unite 
  
 Til we die we wont be forgotten well never give in 
 Til we die this war weve achieved has allowed us to win 
 Til we die well never be broken we wont be denied 
 Til we die our war is the pressure we need to unite120873 
 That was all I got and now you got me 
 All I ever really wanted was to take the blame 
 I will go down in history and not down in flames 
 Meningitis I will survive this 
 Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis 
 The time of The Nine has begun 
 Get out of the way or you will suffer as one 
 This is so typical apocalyptical 
 Hanging on abysmal release Jesus 
 I dont need this dont wanna be this 
 Icon in the making my hands are fucking shaking 
 What if God doesnt care 
 Remember surrender 
 the time is now 
 Continue were in you 
 and we will burn your cities down 
 America is a killing name it doesnt feel or discriminate 
 Life is just a killing field its all thats left nothings real 
 Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash 
 We are the fatal and vital ones of the world 
 And we will burn your cities down 
 Down 
 We will burn your cities down 
 Feed the hungry feed them shit feed them bones and politics 
 You wanna revolutionize Be specific and believe your eyes 
 Start a war in another backyard and well destroy your house of cards 
 Give me a minute and Ill change your mind give me a bullet and Ill change your life 
 We will burn your cities down 
 We will burn your cities 
 down 
 America 
 what if God doesnt care 
 What if God doesnt careI dont seem to care today 
 I mirror what I love with what I hate 
 Empty ways can cloud your eyes 
 I only know because I tried 
 So come with me come with me 
 Lets meet our contestants 
 Theres no better time to play the game 
 I dont want to give it away 
 Underneath the citadels 
 Buried deep with your guilt and regrets 
 Leading in the dark everything is wonderful 
 I dont care I dont want to forget 
 Why is it a crime Its none of your business 
 I prefer to be in hell by myself 
 Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who 
 Refuses to forgive when nothing was taken 
 No one else survives 
 Ive seen you live now watch me die 
 But we dont see the writing on the wall 
 And as I close my eyes 
 Alone in here I realize 
 The one that kills the least still kills us all 
 Hidden in the rubble 
 Everybodys got a story to tell 
 What do I need Eliminate the possible 
 All thats left is a man in a cell 
 Maybe Im wrong maybe a decision is 
 The better way to go the better way to be 
 Ive got my demons go get your own 
 Save another number dont forget to hate me 
 The one that kills the least still killed us all 
 Lost in here I realize 
 All all allYeah 
 I did my time and I want out 
 So effusive—fade—it doesnt cut 
 The soul is not so vibrant 
 The reckoning the sickening 
 Packaging subversion 
 Pseudosacrosanct perversion 
 Go drill your deserts go dig your graves 
 Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save 
 Sinking in getting smaller again 
 Im done it has begun 
 Im not the only one 
 And the rain will kill us all 
 We throw ourselves against the wall 
 But no one else can see 
 The preservation of the martyr in me 
 Psychosocial 
 Oh there are cracks in the road we laid 
 But when the temple fell 
 The secrets have gone mad 
 This is nothing new but when we killed it all 
 The hate was all we had 
 Who needs another mess 
 We could start over 
 Just look me in the eyes and say Im wrong 
 Now theres only emptiness 
 But Im missing something 
 I think were done 
 The limits of the dead 
 Fake antifascist lie psychosocial 
 I tried to tell you but psychosocial 
 Your Purple Hearts are giving out psychosocial 
 Cant stop a killing idea psychosocial 
 If its hunting season psychosocial 
 Is this what you want psychosocial 
 The limits of the deadGently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure 
 A pleasure thatll take my mind off the reality of my life 
 It will remain there til I wish to retrieve it 
 And everything that lays in the palm of lifes hands 
 Yes Yes Yes YesI am I am 
 The fire that makes you run 
 Streight away from me 
 Full of it you are 
 I dont a ever bout you 
 Run alive 
 Look at you 
 Look at me 
 All of us together in the black whole 
 Black whole 
 Black whole 
 Laugh last you break through 
 Rhetoric  better look both ways 
 Get you 
 In you 
 Threw you 
 To you 
 Threw with that day when you went no where from the start 
 You never gonna get it 
 You never gonna get it 
 You dont deserve it 
 Youve never deserved it 
 Dont move stay back from a start 
 Ah 
 The world 
 Oh yeah 
 YeahTheres a dog loose in the wood 
 Dogfish rising 
 Its good for gnawin 
 Right wing interlude 
 In the 1990s 
 Thats got a nice groove to it here 
 Thank you 
 I saw human hand 
 Windmills like two 
 Somethings at my left 
 Screaming through their muzzles 
 Postniff scrutchies 
 Burn em for their nipples 
 Another rubber Rolex 
 So skinny I knows 
 Rookie lurks 
 Batterypowered power tool 
 God spokes to me 
 Blistering cabbage 
 That dogfish is dead 
 Dont even bother taping fuck this 
 Bring me this band 
 Crusty fuzzy nuts byeI know my uses I have my pride 
 But my heart is still untamed 
 I learned my lessons Ive conquered death 
 I go on and Im unashamed 
 Ill paint your bones to match my eyes 
 Theyre the darkest I have ever seen 
 Until Im lucid I cant be told 
 I know my voices they tell me to believe 
 Another fucking accident out of control 
 All the attitudes will never change 
 My imitations are leading the way 
 I cant accept that I still dont find this strange 
 In light of my ability to feel denial 
 I walk away from everything with just a smile 
 The agony of coming home has gone away 
 Its everywhere its everyone its everyday 
 Are you ready for the time of your life 
 I beg your pardon Im out of the way 
 A new conspiracy has taken my place 
 So over and over I smell the decay 
 Believe what you want to the cycle stays the same 
 In light of my ability to undermine 
 I walk away from apathy Im feeling fine 
 The agony of cynicism beckons me 
 Its everywhere its everyone its everything 
 Lets pretend were not at the end 
 Pretend that we have nothing left 
 Pretend that we have nothing leftChild of burning time 
 Child of burning time 
 My only consolation is a lie 
 The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight 
 Winter hasnt ended and it always looks like rain 
 I cant remember anything anything 
 Inside the absolution we succumb 
 And appetites are bittersweet I think Im going numb 
 A chance to give up avarice has marked my one regret 
 The child of burning time is gone 
 He hasnt come back yet 
 Before I tell my story please consider who I am 
 I missed my window years ago Im doing all I can 
 A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away 
 My skin is still the only stain Im left to wear in shame 
 I cut my name into my heart 
 Ill tear it all apart 
 I beg you 
 Burn me away 
 I wont become your hero just to fight the life I save 
 I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all today 
 I burn away 
 My isolation is my course 
 The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source 
 I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame 
 Until this war is over I wont ever lose my rage 
 I cut my name into my soul 
 I guess Ill never know 
 I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all lose it all todaySome feel I dont exist never believing what they see 
 Some feel that Im not fair I leave no time for repentance 
 Tearing the vail mending the vail 
 Tearing the vail 
 Tearing the vail 
 Some feel I bare the mark of man 
 A misguided philosophy 
 Some feel I kill for fun 
 I kill for life 
 I cant escape what Gaias left for me 
 I cant deny a lack of morality 
 I cant believe what Gaias left for me 
 No more 
 No less 
 Need time to think need time to think 
 Need to spill blood so I can drink 
 Take what they give take what they give 
 Some feel Im dead yet still I live 
 Need time to think need time to think 
 Need to spill blood so I can drink 
 Take what they give take what they give 
 Some feel Im dead yet still I live 
 They dont know Im eternal 
 They dont know theyre just cattle 
 EternalI cant get out or Ill die 
 Just let me be 
 Ill never be never 
 Be prepared for Hell and I say oh well 
 Just tell me when I can open my eyes 
 And realize Ive died 
 And realize Ive diedWe too feel alone 
 We too feel alone 
 Weve to feel alone 
 Where have I been all the time 
 Lost enslaved fatal decline 
 Ive been waiting for this to unfold good 
 The pieces are only as good as the whole 
 What if I never saw you again 
 Without hearing what I have to sayRelax its over you belong to me I fill your mouth with dirt 
 Relax its over you can never leave I take your second digit with me 
 Love 
 You are my first I can barely breathe I find you fascinating 
 You are my favorite lay you down to sleep Its all that I can do to stop 
 So blue so broken paper doll decays I havent left you yet 
 So cold subversive your eyes are full of bleach tomorrow I will go away again 
 Shut up 
 Em ta kool tnoD 
 Cant breathe 
 You are mine You will always be mine 
 I can tear you apart I can recombine you 
 All I want is to covet you all 
 You belong to me 
 I will kill you to love you 
 Love Love Love 
 Love you 
 Do you see 
 Youll live foreverThis is the year where hope fails you 
 The test subjects run the experiment 
 And the bastard you know is the hero you hate 
 But cohesion is possible if we try 
 Theres no reason theres no lesson 
 No time like the present 
 Tell me right now what have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose except your soul 
 Whos with us 
 I fight for the unconventional 
 My right and its unconditional 
 I can only be as real as I can 
 The disadvantage is I never knew the plan 
 This isnt just a way to be a martyr 
 I cant walk alone any longer 
 I fight for the ones who cant fight 
 And if I lose at least I tried 
 We we are the new diabolic 
 We we are the bitter bucolic 
 If I have to give my life you can have it 
 We we are the pulse of the maggots 
 I wont be the inconsequential 
 I wont be the wasted potential 
 I can make it as severe as I can 
 Until you realize youll never take a stand 
 It isnt just a onesided version 
 Weve dealt with a manic subversion 
 I wont let the truth be perverted 
 And I wont leave another victim deserted 
 Do you understand Yes 
 Say it again say it again We wont die 
 We fight till no one can fight us 
 We live and no one can stop us 
 We pull when were pushed too far 
 And the advantage is the bottom line is 
 We never had to fight in the first place 
 We only had to spit back in their face 
 We wont walk alone any longer 
 What doesnt kill us only makes us stronger 
 Say it again say it again We wont die
