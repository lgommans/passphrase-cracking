Clouds roll by 
 Reeling is what they say 
 Or is it just my way 
 Wind blows by 
 Low light 
 Sidetracked 
 Cant see my tracks 
 Your scent way back 
 Can I be here all alone 
 Clear a path to my home 
 Blood runs dry 
 Books and jealousy tell me wrong 
 I will feel calm 
 Voice blows by 
 Car crash 
 Cant wear my mask 
 Your first my last 
 Two birds is what theyll see 
 Getting lost upon their way 
 Eye sight 
 I need the light 
 Ill find my way from wrong 
 Whats realDrive down the street cant find the keys to my own fucking home 
 Ill take a walk so I could curse my ass for being dumb 
 Ill make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone 
 Stopped at the supermarket people stare like Im a dog 
 Im going to Lukins 
 Ive got a spot at Lukins 
 I knocked the door at Lukins 
 Open the fridge Now I know life is worth 
 I found the key but I return to find an open door 
 Some fucking freak who claims I fathered by rape her own son 
 I find my wife I call the cops this days works never done 
 The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gunI got bugs 
 I got bugs in my room 
 Bugs in my bed 
 Bugs in my ears 
 Their eggs in my head 
 Bugs in my pockets 
 Bugs in my shoes 
 Bugs in the way I feel about you 
 Bugs on my window 
 Trying to get in 
 They dont go nowhere 
 Waiting waiting 
 Bugs on my ceiling 
 Crowded the floor 
 Standing sitting kneeling 
 A few block the door 
 And now the questions 
 Do I kill them 
 Become their friend 
 Do I eat them 
 Raw or well done 
 Do I trick them 
 I dont think theyre dumb 
 Do I join them 
 Looks like thats the one 
 I got bugs on my skin 
 Tickle my nausea 
 I let it happen again 
 Theyre always takin over 
 I see they surround me 
 I see see them deciding my fate 
 Oh that which was once was once up to me 
 Now its too late 
 I got bugs in my room oneonone 
 Thats when I had a chance 
 Ill just stop now 
 Ill become naked 
 And with them Ill become oneBut I think your drums are 
 No cheep ones

 This is my its actually the devil in santa clauses suit after all if you switch the letters around in santa it speels satin 
 You gotta switch em around and change a couple of them 
 I just saw that last night on the news you know those littleThis song was played live in Champaign IL 
 Some people seem so obsessed with the morning 
 Get up early just to watch the sunrise 
 Others like it more when theres fire in the sky 
 Worship the sun when its high 
 Some people go for those sultry evenings 
 Cocktails in the blue red and grey 
 But I like every minute of the day 
 I dig every second 
 So long as you are on my mind 
 Each precious moment has its special charm 
 Its all right when youre around rain or shine 
 I know a crowd who only lives after midnight 
 Their faces always seem so pale 
 And then theres friends of mine who must have sunlight 
 They say a suntan never fails 
 I know I was a man who worked a night shift 
 I was lucky to get a job and some pay 
 Now I like every minute of the day 
 I could laugh in the snow and rain 
 I get a buzz from being cold and wet 
 The pleasure seems to balance out the pain 
 And so you see that Im completely crazy 
 I even shun the south of France 
 The people on my hill they say Im lazy 
 But when they sing I uh 
 But when they sleep I sing and dance 
 I know a crowd who or something 
 Cocktails in the blue red and grey 
 I like every minute of the dayHere far away 
 One could feel the earth vibrate 
 Moon changing shape and shade 
 As we all do under its gaze 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 Round we go 
 Where we stop yeah no one knows 
 So tonight the moon I go 
 Yellow moon on the rise ooh 
 An echo that rings 
 A bullet unchained 
 One life one grave 
 Joins the parade ah 
 The sky grows dark 
 With fallen stars 
 Whod come so far 
 A headstone engraved 
 The colors turn gray 
 The black and white fades 
 OohWell I stood stonelike at midnight 
 Suspended in my masquerade 
 I combed my hair til it was just right 
 And commanded the night brigade 
 I was open to pain 
 And crossed by the rain 
 And I walked with a crooked crutch 
 I strolled all alone 
 Through the fallout zone 
 Came out with my soul untouched 
 I stood in the crowd and read something loud 
 But when they said Put out I stood up 
 Oohooh growin up 
 The flag of piracy flew from my mast 
 My sails were set wing to wing 
 I had a jukebox graduate for a first mate 
 She couldnt sail but she sure could sing 
 And I pushed B52 
 And bombed em with the blues 
 With my gear set stubborn on standing 
 Never once gave thought to landing 
 But when they said Put down I put up 
 I stood in the crowded warmth of the crowd 
 But when they said Sit down I threw up 
 Oohooh 
 Oohooh growin up yeahCome to send not condescend 
 Transcendental consequence 
 Is to transcend where we are 
 Who are we who we are 
 Trampled moss on your soul 
 Changes all youre apart 
 Seen it all not at all 
 Cant defend fucked up man 
 Take me for a ride before we leave 
 Circumstance clapping hands 
 Driving winds happenstance 
 Off the track in the mud 
 Thats the moss in the aforementioned verse 
 Just a little time before we leave 
 Stoplight plays its part 
 So I would say youve got a part 
 Whats your part Who you are 
 You are who who you areFree the people oh got your love whoa X2 
 Shower the people you love with love 
 Show them the way that you feel 
 X2 
 Im specialcause Im gonna make you see 
 Nobody loves you nobody like me 
 Im special so special 
 I got to have some of your attention give it to me 
 Cause Im 
 Ill kick the fuck out of you 
 Peaceful times have come and gone 
 Its time to fuckin kill somebody 
 I try dont blame me 
 I try peacefully 
 That time has come and gone now its just me 
 Just me this means nothin no more 
 This dont mean nothin no more 
 I dont want to see this no more 
 Unless youre readyless youre ready to stand behind it 
 I dont give a fuck 
 Let the words that you say to me 
 Unless the actions sustain it 
 Its meaningless 
 Were all meaningless 
 The world will go on 
 And were all meaningless 
 The world will spin 
 I refuse I refuse to believe 
 Were meaningless meaningless 
 Were meaningless I refuse 
 I wont give up yeah 
 Meaningless were not meaningless 
 Were not invisible were not meaningless 
 If you love someone tell em 
 Show them the way that you feel X3 
 OhAye davanita davanita davanita davanita 
 Davanita davanita davanita davanita 
 Davanita davanita davanita davanitaHello this is Abe Vigoda 
 And I just want to say that Alice in Chains rocked my worldWhen the spoon is hot 
 And the needles sharp 
 And you drift away 
 I can hear you say 
 That the world in black 
 Is upon your back 
 And your body shakes 
 So you ditch away 
 And you close the shades 
 Dont try to do it 
 Dont try to kill your time 
 You might do it 
 Then you cant change your mind 
 Youve got a hold on to your time 
 Till your break through these 
 Times of trouble 
 When you try to talk 
 And the words get hard 
 And they put you down 
 Dont you stay 
 Dont you ditch away 
 I saw you swinging 
 Swinging your mothers sword 
 I know youre playing but 
 Sometimes the rules get hard 
 But if somebody left you out on a ledge 
 If somebody pushed you over the edge 
 If somebody loved you and left you for dead 
 You got to hold on to your time till you break 
 Through these times of troubleOoh 
 Oh 
 I see the world 
 Feel the chill 
 Which way to go 
 Windowsill 
 I see the words 
 On a rocking horse of time 
 I see the birds in the rain 
 Oh dear Dad 
 Can you see me now 
 I am myself 
 Like you somehow 
 Ill ride the wave 
 Where it takes me 
 Ill hold the pain 
 Release me 
 Oh I 
 Ill wait up in the dark 
 For you to speak to me 
 Ill open up 
 Release me Dad 
 Ooh 
 OohWaitin watchin the clock its four o clock its got to stop 
 Tell him take no more she practices her speech 
 As he opens the door she rolls over 
 Pretends to sleep as he looks her over 
 She lies and says shes in love with him 
 Cant find a better man 
 She dreams in color she dreams in red 
 Ohh 
 Talkin to herself theres no one else who needs to know 
 She tells herself ooh 
 Memories back when she was bold and strong 
 And waiting for the world to come along 
 Swears she knew it now she swears hes gone 
 She lies and says she still loves him 
 She loved him yeah 
 She dont want to leave this way 
 She feeds him yeah 
 Thats why shell be back again 
 cant find a better man 
 Cant find a better manTried to remember but my feelings get old for sure 
 Tried to recall but its gone 
 Lucky stars in your eyes 
 Im walking the cow 
 I really dont know how I came here 
 I really dont know why Im staying here 
 Tried to point my finger but the wind keeps blowin me around 
 In circles in circles 
 I really dont know what I have to fear 
 I really dont know why I have to care 
 Lucky stars in your eyesHear the sirens 
 Hear the sirens 
 Hear the circus so profound 
 I hear the sirens 
 More and more in this here town 
 Let me catch my breath to breathe 
 And reach across the bed 
 Just to know were safe 
 I am a grateful man 
 The slightest bit of light 
 And I can see you clear 
 Have to take your hand and feel your breath 
 For fear this someday will be over 
 I hold you close so much to lose 
 Knowing that nothing lasts forever 
 I didnt care before you were here 
 I danced in laughter with the everafter 
 But all things change 
 Let this remain 
 Covering distance in the night 
 The sound echoing closer 
 Will they come for me next time 
 For every choice mistake Ive made 
 Its not my plan 
 To send you in the arms of 
 Another man 
 And if you choose to stay Ill wait 
 Ill understand 
 Its a fragile thing this life we lead 
 If I think too much I can get over 
 Whelmed by the grace by which we live our lives 
 With death over our shoulders 
 Want you to know that should I go 
 I always loved you held you high above true 
 I study your face 
 The fear goes away 
 With death over our shoulder 
 And the fear goes away 
 Ah ah oh oh 
 Ah ah oh ohOne more 
 Ah theres one more that we havent done that one 
 Actually we did a verse in Birmingham Alabama on this tour 
 And if youd like to hear it wed love to play it for you 
 AhYes I understand that every life must end aw huh 
 As we sit alone I know someday we must go aw huh 
 Im a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love 
 Some folks just have one yeah others they got none aw huh 
 Stay with me oh lets just breathe 
 Practiced are my sins never gonna let me win aw huh 
 Under everything just another human being aw huh 
 Yeah I dont wanna hurt theres so much in this world to make me bleed 
 Stay with me youre all I see 
 Did I say that I need you 
 Did I say that I want you 
 Oh if I didnt Im a fool you see 
 No one knows this more than me 
 As I come clean 
 I wonder every day as I look upon your face aw huh 
 Everything you gave and nothing you would take aw huh 
 Nothing you would take 
 Everything you gave 
 Oh did I say that I want you 
 Hold me till I die 
 Meet you on the other sideDont it make you smile 
 Dont it make you smile 
 When the sun dont shine Shine at all 
 Dont it make me smile 
 When the sun dont shine it dont shine at all 
 I miss you already I miss you always 
 I miss you already I miss you all day 
 This is how I feel 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all around I miss you all day 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all around yeah 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all aroundI took a drive today 
 Time to emancipate 
 I guess it was the beatings made me wise 
 But Im not about to give thanks or apologize 
 I couldnt breathe holding me down 
 Hand on my face pushed to the ground 
 Enmity gauged united by fear 
 Forced to endure what I could not forgive 
 I seem to look away 
 Wounds in the mirror waved 
 It wasnt my surface most defiled 
 Head at your feet fool to your crown 
 Fist on my plate swallowed it down 
 Tried to endure what I could not forgive 
 Saw things 
 Clearer 
 Once you were in my rear view mirror 
 I gather speed from you fucking with me 
 Once and for all Im far away 
 I hardly believe finally the shades are raised 
 Hey yeah 
 Saw things so much clearer 
 Once you once you 
 Rearviewmirror 
 Once you 
 Oh yeahRoutine was the theme hed wake up and wash and pour himself into uniform 
 Something he hadnt imagined being 
 As the merging traffic passed he found himself staring down at his own hands 
 Not remembering the change not recalling the plan was it 
 He was okay but wondering about wandering 
 Was it age by consequence or was he moved by sleight of hand 
 Mondays were made to fall lost on a road he knew by heart 
 It was like a book he read in his sleep endlessly 
 Sometimes he hid in his radio watching others pull into their homes 
 While he was drifting 
 On a line of his own off the line on the side 
 By the by as dirt turned to sand as if moved by sleight of hand 
 When he reached the shore of his clipon world 
 He resurfaced to the norm 
 Organized his few things his coat and keys 
 Any new realizations would have to wait till he had more time more time 
 Time to dream to himself 
 He waves goodbye to himself 
 Ill see you on the other side 
 Another man moved by sleight of handIf I keep holding out 
 Will the light shine through 
 Under this broken roof 
 Its only rain that I feel 
 Ive been wishing out the days 
 Oh oh oh come back 
 I have been planning out 
 All that Id say to you 
 Since you slipped away 
 Know that I still remain true 
 Please say that if you hadnt gone now 
 I wouldnt have lost you another way 
 From wherever you are 
 Oh oh oh oh oh come back 
 And these days they linger on 
 And in the night Ive been waiting for 
 The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams 
 I go to sleep 
 If I dont fall apart 
 Will my memory stay clear 
 So you had to go 
 And I had to remain here 
 But the strangest thing today 
 So far away and yet you feel so close 
 And Im not gonna question it any other way 
 There must be an open door 
 For you ooh to come back 
 And the days they linger on 
 And every night when Im waiting for 
 Sometimes youre there and youre talking back to me 
 Come the morning I can swear that youre next to me 
 And its okay 
 Its okay 
 Oh Ill be here come back come back 
 I Ill be here come back come back 
 Whoo whoo 
 Whoo whooBee girl 
 Youre gonna die 
 You dont wanna be famous 
 You wanna be shy 
 Do your dances 
 Alone in your room 
 Becoming a star

 You know time is long 
 And life is short 
 Begin to live 
 While you still can 
 Believe in nothing

 Those who can be trusted 
 Can change their mind

 Is the present 
 Unwrap your gifts 
 Take your time 
 Everything you imagined 
 Neednt be stuck in your mind 
 Thank youSome people seem so obsessed with the mornin 
 Get up early just to watch the sun rise 
 Other people like it more when theres fire in the sky 
 As long as you are on my mind 
 Each precious moment has its special charm 
 Some people seem to only live after midnight 
 That has faces always seem so pale 
 And Incomprehensible who must have sunlight 
 They say a sun tan never fails 
 I was a man who worked the night shifts 
 I can laugh in the snow and rain 
 The people on my hill they say Im lazy 
 But when they sleep I sing and dance 
 I like every minute of the dayGot a gun 
 Fact I got two 
 Thats okay man cause I love God 
 Glorified version of a pellet gun 
 Feels so manly when armed 
 Doublethink 
 Dumb is strength 
 Never shot at a living thing 
 Glorified version of a 
 Always keep it loaded 
 Kindred to be an American 
 Life comes 
 I can feel your heart 
 I can feel your heart through your neck 
 Like some 
 I can steal your heart from your neck 
 Glorified 
 GlorifiedThieves in the window 
 Trouble down the hall 
 Florescent white ceiling 
 Blood dripping flows 
 Out on the front line 
 Preachers sweep the earth 
 Out on their backsides 
 With nothing in common with no problem 
 Shes just a girl 
 Just just a girl yeah 
 Just one time around 
 She has little chance to make good 
 Distance of her life 
 Decided in the woods 
 Burning fires 
 Feed her it she believes 
 This maid in progress 
 Betrayin your mothers need for a shelter 
 Your just a girl 
 Just just a girl 
 She had little chance to make good 
 Treats them now shes young

 And I listen for the voice inside my head 
 Nothin Ill do this one myself 
 Lay her down as priest does should the Lord be acountin 
 Will be in my honour make it pain painfully quick uh huh 
 Promises are whispered in the age of darkness 
 Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end end yeah

 This God forgotten place 
 First comes love then comes pain 
 Let the games begin 
 Questions rise and answers fall 
 Insurmountable 
 Love boat captain 
 Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear here 
 Its already been sung but it cant be said enough 
 Is this just another phase 
 Of earthquakes making waves 
 Trying to shake the cancer off 
 Aah stupid human beings 
 Once you hold the hand of love 
 Its all surmountable 
 Hold me and make it the truth 
 That when all is lost therell be you 
 Cause to the universe I dont mean a thing 
 And theres just one word I still believe 
 And its love 
 Its an art to live with pain 
 Mix the light into gray 
 Lost nine friends well never know 
 Two years ago today 
 And if our lives became too long 
 Would it add to our regret 
 And the young they can lose hope 
 Cause they cant see beyond today 
 The wisdom that the old cant give away hey 
 Constant recall 
 Sometimes life dont leave you alone 
 That when all is lost there will be you 
 And theres just one word that I still believe 
 And its love love love love love 
 Love boat captain take the reigns 
 Steer us towards the clear 
 I know its already been sung 
 Cant be said enough 
 Love is all you need 
 All you need is love

 Feed the people watch them grow 
 Keep them alive I wont forget this night 
 Please allow me to introduce myself 
 Im a man of wealth and taste 
 Ive been around for a long long year 
 Stole many a mans soul and face 
 And I was round when Jesus Christ 
 Had his moment of doubt and pain 
 Made damn sure that Pilate 
 Washed his hand and sealed his fateHow come 
 They do this to us 
 This boy X2 
 How come 
 They make such a fuss 
 Over this boy 
 This boy 
 Hes there and I dont know what to do 
 Nothin 
 To look up there into 
 This boy X2Oh I see that on a porch a letter sat 
 Then he said I wanna leave it again 
 Once I saw him on a beach of weathered sand 
 And on the sand I wanna leave it again yeah 
 I wanna leave here wanna get wasted on the way yeah 
 Then I called and I said that I want what I said then I called out again 
 And the reason wanna leave here how come I know 
 I said I know but will it be a box or a bag 
 Ah yeah can you see them out on the porch

 All night

 Time to take heed and change direction 
 Time to take stock and make omissions 
 Evacuation 
 Time to take leave all formal functions 
 Time to plant seeds of a reconstruction 
 No time this time to feign reluctance 
 Its like youre waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way 
 Bets put aside youre evil 
 Lets crawl into your face 
 A vision vague or not raising a frightful wake you up 
 Time for evacuation 
 There was a solemn man 
 Watched his twilight disappear 
 in the sand 
 Altered by a falling eagle A warning sign Sign 
 He sensed that worry could be strength with a plan he said 
 Time for evacuation 
 EvacuationWinded is the sailor 
 Drifting by the storm 
 Wounded is the organ he left all 
 Bloodied on the shore 
 Gorgeous was his savior sees her 
 Drowning in his wake 
 Daily taste the salt of her tears but 
 A chance blamed fate 
 Little secrets tremors turned to quakes 
 The smallest oceans still get big big waves 
 Ransom paid the devil 
 He whispers pleasing words 
 Triumphant are the angels 
 If they can get there first 
 Little secrets tremors turn to quakes 
 Ill decide take the dive 
 Take my time not my life 
 Wait for signs believe in lies 
 To get by its divine whoa 
 Oh you know what its like 
 Turns the bow back tows 
 And drops the line 
 Puts his faith in love 
 And tremor ChristEvery night with the lights out where you gone

 Heartabeatin tickin like a bomb 
 After having seen all that they saw

 Things were different then all is different now 
 OBI tried to explain I hope this works somehow

 He expects her to be easy 
 He wants it to be easy 
 But she says no she says no I dont want to 
 She says no she says no I dont want to 
 He expects it too eeasy 
 But she says stop you gotta stop 
 When he says go you still gotta stop 
 When she says stop you gotta stop 
 Last two lines x3 
 He wants it he wants it 
 So badly he wants he wants it 
 But she says no she says no

 He just hurt she wont remove it 
 Like they tuoght us like they tought usCome sail your ships around me 
 And burn your bridges down 
 We make a little history baby 
 Every time you come around 
 Come loose your dogs upon me 
 And let your hair hang down 
 You are a little mystery to me 
 We talked about it all night long 
 We define our moral ground 
 But when I crawl into your arms 
 Everything comes tumbling down 
 Come sail your ships around me 
 And burn your bridges downSo so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell blue skies from pain 
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail A smile from a veil 
 Do you think you can tell 
 And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees 
 Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change 
 And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage 
 How I wish how I wish you were here 
 Were just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year 
 Running over the same old ground What have you found The same old fears 
 Wish you were hereHow does he do it How do they do it Uncanny and immutable 
 This is such a happening tailpipe of a party 
 Like sugar the guests are so refined 
 A confidence man but why so beleaguered 
 Hes not a leader hes a Texas leaguer 
 Swinging for the fence got lucky with a strike 
 Drilling for fear makes the job simple 
 Born on third thinks he got a triple 
 Blackout weaves its way through the cities 
 Blackout weaves its way 
 I remember when you sang 
 That song about today 
 Now its tomorrow and 
 Everything has changed 
 A think tank of aloof multiplication 
 A nicotine wish and a columbus decanter 
 Retrenchment and hoggishness 
 The aristocrat choir sings 
 Whats the ruckus 
 The haves have not a clue 
 The immenseness of suffering 
 And the odd negotiation a rarity 
 With onionskin plausibility of life 
 And a keyboard reaffirmation 
 Everything has changedOh girls just wanna have fun 
 They just wanna they just wanna 3x 
 Be left aloneWhen people keep repeating that youll never fall in love 
 When everybody keeps retreating but you cant seem to get enough 
 Let my love open the door let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door to your heart 
 Let my love open the door ooh 
 Let my love open the door 
 When everything feels all over everybody seems unkind 
 Ill give you a fourleaf clover take all worry out of your mind 
 Let my love open the door ooh to your heart 
 I got the only key to your heart 
 I can stop you falling apart 
 Try today youll find this way 
 Come on and give me a chance to say 
 Let my love open the door its all Im living for 
 Release yourself from misery 
 Theres only one thing going to set you free 
 Thats my love thats my love 
 Let my love open the door to your heart 
 When tragedy befalls you dont let it drag you down 
 Love can cure your problems youre so lucky Im around 
 Let my love open the door to your heartThe sun was in clouds the sun looked out 
 Exposed a trail of mist and spouts 
 Ships followed the ancient lead 
 Deceiving friends under the sea 
 Wow imagine that They wont fight back 
 I got a theory on that 
 A whales heart is as big as a car 
 A whalers thought must be smudged by the dark 
 They wont fight back Im sure they know how 
 Means they love or are too proud 
 They swim its really free 
 Its a beautiful thing to see 
 They sing 
 Hunters of land hunters of sea 
 Exploit anything for money 
 I refer to anybody 
 That takes advantage of what that is free 
 They wont fight back 
 Its only a thought that makes it seem right 
 What you dont see is because of your sight 
 Take what you want kill what you can 
 Thats just one way from the mind of man 
 Take their lives sell their parts 
 But theres no taking of their hearts 
 If I was lost at sea 
 That harpoon boat in front of me 
 Its the whale Id like to be 
 They wont fight back 
 They dont know how 
 They wont fight backHeres a token of my openness 
 Of my need to not disappear 
 How Im feeling so revealing to me 
 I found my mind too clear 
 I just need someone to be there for me 
 I just want someone to be there for me 
 All the static in my attica 
 Shoots down my side nerve 
 To the ocean of my platitudes 
 Longitudes latitudes its so absurd 
 I just need someone to be there for 
 I just want someone to be there for 
 Someone to be there for 
 Ill stop trying to make a difference 
 Im not trying to make a difference 
 No way 
 Cause Ill stop trying to make a difference 
 Ooh lets call in an angel

 With 1 More minute to go 
 And now Im swinginand here I goooooooooA man lies in his bed in a room with no door 
 He waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter 
 After spending half his life searching he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he stared 
 He is alive but feels absolutely nothing 
 So is he 
 When he was six he believed that the moon over head followed him 
 By nine he had deciphered the allusion trading magic for fact 
 No trade backs 
 So this is what its like to be an adult 
 If he only knew now what he knew then 
 Im open 
 Come on in come on in 
 Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets with no covers 
 He decides to dream dream up a new self for himselfIf I ever were to lose you 
 Id surely lose myself 
 Everything I have found dear 
 Ive not found by myself 
 Try and sometimes youll succeed 
 To make this man of me 
 All my stolen missing parts 
 Ive no need for anymore 
 I believe 
 And I believe cause I can see 
 Our future days 
 Days of you and me 
 Back when I was feeling broken 
 I focused on a prayer 
 You came deep as any ocean 
 Did something out there hear 
 All the complexities and games 
 No one wins but somehow theyre still played 
 All the missing crooked hearts 
 They may die but in us they live on 
 When hurricanes and cyclones raged 
 When wind turned dirt to dust 
 When floods they came or tides they raised 
 Ever closer became us 
 All the promises at sundown 
 Ive meant them like the rest 
 All the demons used to come round 
 Im grateful now theyve left 
 So persistent in my ways 
 Hey angel I am here to stay 
 No resistance no alarms 
 Please this is just too good to be gone 
 You and me 
 Days 
 You and meDont even think about reachin me I wont be home 
 Dont even think about stoppin by dont think of me at all 
 I did what I had to do if there was a reason it was you 
 Ah dont even think about gettin inside 
 Voices in me head ooh voices 
 I got scratches all over my arms 
 One for each day since I fell apart 
 I did oh what I had to do if there was a reason it was you 
 Footsteps in the hall it was you you oh 
 Pictures on my chest it was you it was you 
 Hey I did what I had to do oh and if there was a reason 
 Oh there wasnt no reason no 
 And if theres something youd like to do 
 Just let me continue to blame you 
 Pictures on my chest it was you you ohOh he deals them off off the top ties them off 
 Fills it up with his past gets carried away 
 Oh half his life a handmedown wasted away 
 Oh he fills it up with the love of a girl 
 Oh he left it alone drilled the pain with money to buy 
 How he makes his getaway 
 Oh he chose a path heavy the fall quarter to four 
 Fills his mind with the thought of a girl 
 GetawayWhat were all those dreams we shared those many years ago 
 What were all those plans we made now left beside the road 
 Behind us in the road 
 More than friends I always pledged cause friends they come and go 
 People change as does everything I wanted to grow old 
 Just want to grow old 
 Slide on next to me I’m just a human being 
 I will take the blame but just the same this is not me 
 You see believe 
 I’m better than this 
 Don’t leave me so cold Im buried beneath the stones 
 I just want to hold on and know I’m worth your love 
 Enough I don’t think 
 There’s such a thing 
 It’s my fault now Ive been caught a sickness in my bones 
 How it pains to leave you here with the kids on your own 
 Just don’t let me go 
 Help me see myself cause I can no longer tell 
 Looking up from the inside of the bottom of a well 
 It’s Hell I yell but no one hears 
 Before I disappear whisper in my ear 
 Give me something to echo in my unknown futures ear 
 My dear the end comes near 
 I’m here but not much longerPower high power low 
 You can take em all to school 
 You can fly wilt the stilt had nothing on you 
 Lambchops and afrodo milwaukee bucks and a barbecue 
 33 just like you 
 Sweet lew how could you 
 Sweet lew makin me blue 
 A laker trade their bobbyd for a house a crew by the sea 
 A little help from 32 showtime and worthy 
 Those were the days preinvestment spree 
 Sweet lew is it true 
 I grew up trying to copy you bruce lee and a kungfu 
 Acta jazzman yogi too 
 Little did I know a loose screw 
 But you had your own shoe 
 Build him high build him tall a taiku with a basketball 
 Tear em down one and all 
 72 is a long way to fall 
 Sweet lew hows the view 
 Sweet lew how could youWhen the kingdom comes 
 He puts his records on 
 And with his blistered thumb hits play 
 And with the volume up 
 He goes and fills his cup 
 And lets the drummers drum take away the pain 
 The pain 
 Breaking forsaken 
 Whats that youre taking 
 Aaw needing the feeling 
 He lets the records play 
 Should the future dim 
 A cigarette lights hymn 
 Vaporized a green light grin 
 And when the shotglass talks 
 He knows to listen up 
 Until hes nice and numb again 
 Again again 
 Shakened awakened 
 Not one for faking 
 The kneeling his healing 
 Theres wisdom in his ways 
 I been down and I fell so hard and far from grace 
 I been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face 
 I been off but Im on up above my feet my feet again 
 Eh 
 Hey hey 
 Shaken foresaken 
 Whats that your taking 
 Oh theres wisdom in his ways 
 Ow 
 Get on with it boy 
 Faster little fasterLight green to green dark green brown 
 Every life is falling down 
 Brown to black its coming back 
 Dies to be part of the ground 
 Seed to seedling root to stem 
 Eyes no eyes theres no difference 
 Every life is looking in 
 Swallowing seeds on the deathbed 
 Dig a hole in the garden 
 Everyone is practicing 
 But this worlds an accident 
 I was the fool because I thought 
 I thought the world 
 Turns out the world thought me 
 Its all the other way around 
 Were upside down 
 Dad hes gone up in flames 
 But this aint no movie 
 This aint no book you can close 
 When the big lie hits your eye 
 Our worlds an accident 
 Its all the other way round 
 Down down down 
 Let the fluency set it down 
 Down 
 Theres an upside of down 
 The moon is rolling round our world 
 Our world 
 Our worldIts out of my hands making your hands meet 
 Stumble as its crumbling out of reach 
 Its in the cards of destiny your sanity in tow 
 Designate my luck 
 Uh resignate 
 This power has no roots to guide no role 
 Trust me rusted minds refuse to go 
 Unwillingness is meaningless to walk away in vain 
 Designate my will 
 Ah designate my fill 
 Ah resignate 
 My will is crashing synapses flashing slow 
 Ah days like frame by frame where do they go 
 Ah yeah why fight Forget it cannot spend it after I go 
 Roll them high 
 Throw them again 
 All gods dice 
 Monkey driven call this the living Ha 
 Ah too much thought its overwrought a hole 
 Yeah minding yours whats mine not yours 
 Will finish us off 
 Ah designate my life 
 Ah designate my view 
 Ah resignate my will my will my will I will 
 Resignate my GodSomeday at christmas men wont be boys 
 Playing with bombs like kids play with toys 
 One warm December our hearts will see 
 A world where men are free 
 Someday at christmas therell be no war 
 When we have learned what christmas is for 
 When we have found what lifes really worth 
 Therell be peace on earth 
 Someday all our dreams will come to be 
 Someday in a world where men are free 
 Maybe not in time for you and me 
 But someday at christmas time 
 Someday at christmas well see a land 
 With no hungry children 
 No emtpy hand 
 One happy morning people will share 
 A world where people care 
 Someday at christmas 
 Therell be no tears 
 When all men are equal 
 No man has fears 
 One shining moment 
 One prayer away 
 From our world today 
 Men will not fail 
 Hate will be gone 
 And love will prevail 
 Someday a new world 
 That we can start 
 With hope in every heart

 Were all just visiting all just breaking like waves 
 The oceans made me but who came up with love 
 Push me pull me push me but pull me out 
 So if there were no angels would there be no sin 
 You better stop me before I begin 
 But let me say 
 If I behave can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground 
 Somewhere nice make it nice 
 Where the land meets high tide 
 Push me pull me or pull me out 
 Like a cloud dropping rain Im discarding all thought 
 Ill dry up leaving puddles on the ground 
 Im like an opening band for the sun 
 Push me pull me or just pull me out out out  
 Ive had enough said enough felt enough Im fineI admit it  whats to say Yeah 
 Ill relive it without pain 
 Backstreet lover on the side of the road 
 I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode 
 I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes 
 I play 
 Once upon a time I could control myself 
 Ooh once upon a time I could lose myself yeah 
 Oh try and mimic whats insane ooh 
 I am in it where do I stand 
 Oh indian summer and I hate the heat 
 I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat 
 I got my hand in my pocket so determined discreet 
 I pray 
 Once upon a time I could control myself 
 Ooh once upon a time I could lose myself yeah yeah 
 You think I got my eyes closed 
 But Im lookin at you the whole fuckin time 
 Ooh once upon a time I could control myself yeah 
 Once upon a time I could lose myself yeah yeah yeah 
 Once upon a time I could love myself yeah 
 Once upon a time I could love you yeah 
 Once once once once 
 Yeah once once yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahThe mind is gray like the city 
 Packing in and overgrown 
 Love is deep dig it out 
 Standing in a hole alone 
 Working for something 
 That one can never hold 
 A place in the clouds 
 Good place to hide oh my oh 
 So Im flying away away 
 Driving away away 
 Finding hope in ways I missed before 
 I missed before 
 The TV she talks to me 
 Breaking news and building walls 
 Selling me what I dont need 
 I never knew soap made you taller 
 So Im gliding away away 
 Hiding away away 
 So much talk it makes no sense at all 
 My senses have gone AWOL AWOL AWOL AWOL AWOL 
 So Im hiding away away 
 Passing new friends I wont know at all 
 Wont know at all 
 It doesnt hurt when I bleed 
 But my memories they eat me 
 Ive seen it all before 
 Bring it on cause Im no victim 
 Dying 
 away away 
 DyingI wanna shake 
 I wanna wind out 
 I wanna leave 
 This mind and shout 
 Ive lived 
 All this life 
 Like an ocean 
 In disguise 
 I dont live forever 
 You cant keep me here 
 I wanna race 
 With the sundown 
 I want a last breath 
 I dont let out 
 Forgive 
 Every being 
 The bad feelings 
 Its just me 
 I wont wait for answers 
 I wanna rise 
 And say goodnight 
 I Wanna take 
 A look on the other side 
 Its been wonder 
 Full at night 
 I will live for ever 
 You cant keep me hereTidal waves dont beg forgiveness crashed and on their way 
 Father he enjoyed collisions others walked away 
 A snowflake falls in may 
 And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out 
 Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow goodbye for now 
 Nature has its own religion gospel from the land 
 Father ruled by long division young men they pretend 
 Old men comprehend 
 And the sky breaks at dawn shedding light upon this town theyll all come round 
 Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow goodye for now 
 And the road the old man paved 
 The broken seams along the way 
 The rusted signs left just for me 
 He was guiding me Love his own way 
 Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow 
 As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for nowYoull be 
 Going out with radio 
 Going out with disco 
 Going out like bacchanal 
 Ill be 
 Going out with telephone 
 Going out alone 
 To the radar zone 
 Its all just inadvertent imitation 
 And I dont mean mine 
 Its all across this nation 
 If its just inadverdent simulation 
 A pattern in all mankind 
 Whats got the whole world fakin it 
 Playing with my magazine 
 Using up my Listerine 
 Like Ovaltine 
 And youll be 
 Dipping in your battleship 
 For the latest tip 
 For the latest dream 
 If its just inadvertent imitation 
 Whats got the whole world fakin 
 Whats got the whole world fakin it yeahSaid adont worry bout a thing worry bout a thing now 
 Every little thing is gonna be all right all right 
 Said adont worry bout a thing 
 Woke up this mornin cried with the rising sun 
 Three little birds were on my doorstep 
 Singin sweet songs of melodies pure and smooth 
 Singin this is a message to you 
 I said adont worry about a thing worry bout a thing now 
 Every little things gonna be all right all right 
 Said a dont worry about a thing worry bout a thing now 
 Every little thing yeah is gonna be all right all right yeahWere all crazy 
 Were all crazy and were  
 Were all crazy 
 Were all crazy and were How good is he 
 How warm are his eyes 
 Youll see its not a reprise 
 There he arrived 
 Too late and too tethered away 
 To put on his suit and his tie 
 How good is he 
 How warm is his heart 
 Or ego telling him which place to park 
 Did he relate the message is clearly hardly 
 Grounds for dismissal outright 
 I wake up and wait up 
 When angers in fashion 
 It echoes through the mansions 
 When Aprils in may oh uh oh 
 The answers are fatal 
 When I wait up and wake up 
 If hes truly out of sight 
 Is he truly out of mind 
 If hes truly out of sightPirates Im sayin they rob I 
 Board the merchant ships 
 Im not sayin were not a part of it 
 From the bottomless pit 
 But my hands were made strong 
 By the force of the Almighty 
 They dont say that your generation triumphantly 
 Wont you help to sing 
 These songs of freedom 
 Cause all I ever had 
 Redemption song 
 Emancipate yourself from mental slavery 
 None but ourselves can free our mind 
 Have no fear for atomic energy 
 Cause none of them can stop the time 
 How long can they steal our prophets 
 While we stand beside and look 
 They dont say Im your generation 
 Oh and I say 
 Redemption song x2 
 Say some say its just a part of it 
 You got to fulfill the book 
 Redemption song X2 
 This song of freedom 
 OhThis broken wheel is coming undone 
 And the roads exploding 
 But youre keeping me strong 
 Rolling along with you 
 Love is a tower 
 And youre the key 
 Leading me higher 
 When you let me in 
 Keeping us close so close 
 On down the line 
 Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun 
 With no one knowing 
 Moving along with you 
 You are a tower of 
 Strength to me 
 The darkening hour 
 Sees light again 
 Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah 
 You are you are you are you are 
 Of strength to me 
 I am the shoreline 
 But youre the sea 
 You are 
 You 
 You areI have faced it 
 A life wasted 
 Im never going back again 
 Having tasted 
 I escaped it 
 Im never going back againDown Fall by the wayside no getting out 
 Down Cry me a river dried up and dammed 
 The names can be changed but the place is still the same 
 I am loaded Told that alls for naught Holds me down 
 Rise Life is in motion Im stuck in line 
 Rise You cant be neutral on a moving train 
 One day the symptoms fade Think Ill throw these pills away 
 And if hope could grow from dirt like me It can be done 
 Wont let the light escape from me 
 Wont let the darkness swallow me 
 So longSliding out of reverse into drive this 
 Wheel will be turning right then straight 
 Off in the sunset shell ride 
 She can remember a time denied 
 Stood by the side of the road spilled like wine now 
 Shes out on her own and Im high 
 Theres no leaving here 
 Ask Im an ear 
 Shes disappeared 
 They said that timing was everything 
 Made him want to be everywhere 
 Theres a lot to be said for nowhere 
 Hes disappeared 
 Fuck it weve disappearedAt home drawing pictures 
 Of mountaintops 
 With him on top 
 Lemon yellow sun 
 Arms raised in a V 
 And the dead lay 
 In pools of maroon below 
 Daddy didnt give attention 
 Oh to the fact that mommy didnt care 
 King Jeremy the Wicked 
 Oh ruled his world 
 Jeremy spoke in class today 
 Clearly I remember 
 Picking on the boy 
 Seemed a harmless little fuck 
 Ooh but we unleashed a lion 
 Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess ladys breast 
 How could I forget 
 And he hit me with a surprise left 
 My jaw left hurting 
 Ooh dropped wide open 
 Just like the day 
 Oh like the day I heard 
 Daddy didnt give affection no 
 And the boy was something that mommy wouldnt wear 
 Whoo whoo whoo whoo 
 Try to forget this 
 Try to forget this 
 Try to erase this 
 Try to erase this 
 From the blackboard 
 Jeremy spoke in spoke in 
 spoke in 
 Whoa 
 spoke in spoke in 
 Spoke in spoke in 
 Ahh yeah 
 Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh yeah 
 Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh 
 Uh huhDriftin 
 Driftin away 
 I got myself a mansion 
 And I gave it away 
 Its not the world thats heavy 
 Its just the friends that you save 
 But Im driftin 
 Driftin 
 Driftin along 
 I rid myself of worries 
 And the worries were gone 
 I can run when I want to 
 And I sleep like a dog 
 Im just driftin 
 The suitcoats say 
 There is money to be made 
 They get so damn excited 
 But I guess its their way 
 My road it may be lonely 
 Just because its not paved 
 Its good for driftin 
 Aw the suitcoats say 
 Nothing gets in their way 
 Driftin uhhuh 
 I feel like going back there 
 But never for long 
 I sometimes wonder if they know that Im gone 
 DriftinNow all the Sundays seem so blue 
 Just a changing week it is to blame 
 Dont wanna open any wounds 
 I just want to laugh again 
 Dont feel the Christmas without you 
 All the lights have turned to gray 
 The rain upon the passing cars 
 Blurs your smile 
 Was it worth it 
 I was gone so long In the long run 
 You deserve peace 
 Cause giving love is strong In the long run 
 Was it worth it in the long run 
 All the sunshine of your smile 
 Has been turning in the mist 
 Of my eyes 
 Tell me are you leaving 
 Feel all lies 
 In the long run 
 In the long runIts five below in evidence 
 The winded eves and sideways snow 
 His eminence has yet to show 
 Follow the ageless tide 
 Follow the angled light 
 Follow the strangest tribe 
 Its 600 AM Youre waiting for 
 Youve had your feast 
 Youre wanting more 
 Follow the wayward mile 
 Follow the distant high 
 Follow the ancient stripe 
 Follow the angels try 
 Follow the strangest tribeWell I dated your big sister 
 And took her to a show 
 I went for some candy 
 Along came jim dandy 
 And they snuck right out of the door 
 Evry time I see your sister 
 Well shes got somebody new 
 Shes mean and shes evil 
 Like that old boll weevil 
 Guess Ill try my luck with you 
 Well I used to pull your pigtails 
 And pinch your turnedup nose 
 But you been a growin 
 And baby its been showin 
 From your head down to your toes 
 Little sister dont you 
 Little sister dont you kiss me once or twice 
 Then say its very nice 
 And then you run 
 Do what your big sister doneThey dont eat dont sleep 
 They dont feed they dont seethe 
 Bare their gums when they moan and squeak 
 Lick the dirt off a larger ones feet 
 They dont push dont crowd 
 Congregate until theyre much too loud 
 Fuck to procreate till they are dead 
 Drink the blood of their socalled best friend 
 They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way 
 Dont pack themselves together and run as one 
 Dont shit where theyre not supposed to 
 Dont take whats not theirs they dont compare 
 They dont scam dont fight 
 Dont oppress an equals given rights 
 Starve the poor so they can be wellfed 
 Line their holes with the dead ones bread 
 Dont take whats not theirs 
 They dont compare 
 Rats they dont compare 
 Ben the two of us need look no more 
 Ben the two of us need look no moreThe selfish theyre all standing in line 
 Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time 
 Me I figure as each breath goes by 
 I only own my mind 
 The north is to south what the clock is to time 
 Theres east and theres west and theres everywhere life 
 I know I was born and I know that Ill die 
 The inbetween is mine 
 I am mine 
 And the feeling it gets left behind 
 All the innocence lost at one time 
 Significant behind the eyes 
 Theres no need to hide 
 Were safe tonight 
 The ocean is full cause everyones crying 
 The full moon is looking for friends at high tide 
 The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrows denied 
 I only know my mind 
 And the meaning it gets left behind 
 Were safe tonight whoa 
 And the feelings that get left behind 
 All the innocence broken with lies 
 Significance between the lines 
 We may need to hide 
 And the meanings that get left behind 
 Were all different behind the eyes 
 Theres no need to hideIts the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch the blood 
 Flowin out of the bullet hole in his head 
 Its the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch TV 
 See on the news listen to what the man said 
 He said ask not what you can do for your country 
 Whats your country been doing to you 
 Ask not what what you can do for your country 
 Whats your country been doing to your mind 
 Says it an honor to die 
 In a war thats just some politicians lie 
 See how they burned the SLA they said 
 In the USA 
 That never wonders why 
 Kennedy was murdered by the FBI 
 Ask notI am wishing you a well 
 Mind at peace within your cell 
 Covers up I cast you off 
 Ill be watching as you breathe 
 I lie still you move I send you off around the bend 
 I hold your head deep in my arms 
 My fingertips they close your eyes 
 Off you dream my little child 
 Theres a sun around the bend 
 All the evenings close like this 
 All these moments that Ive missed 
 Please forgive me wont you dear 
 Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend 
 Youre an angel when you sleep 
 How I want your soul to keep on and on around the bendYou fool 
 Dude what dyou think youre doing 
 So youre lost 
 My problem is not 
 Conductor says 
 Off of my train 
 Be understood 
 Guess those relationships aint my thing 
 Even if I could

 I wasnt so sure she wanted him to stay 
 What to say What to say 
 But soon she was down soon he was low 
 At a quarter past a holy no 
 She had to turn around 
 When she couldnt hold oh she folded 
 A dissident is here 
 Escape is never the safest path 
 Oh a dissident a dissident is here 
 And to this day shes glided on 
 Always home but so far away like a word misplaced 
 Nothing said what a waste 
 But when she had contact with the conflict 
 There was meaning but she sold him to the state 
 When she couldnt hold she folded 
 Oh oh oh 
 She gave him away when she couldnt hold 
 No she folded 
 Oh couldnt hold on 
 She couldnt hold no she folded 
 Escape is never the safest place 
 Oh a dissident is hereTrouble oh trouble set me free

 But theres a warnin sign on the road ahead 
 Theres a lot of people sayin wed be better off dead 
 Dont feel like Satan but Im to them 
 So I try to forget it anyway I can 
 Keep on rockin in the free world 
 I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand 
 Under an old street light near a garbage can 
 Now shes put the kid away and shes gone to get a hit 
 She hates her life and what shes done to it 
 Thats one more kid thatll never go to school 
 Never get to fall in love never get to be cool 
 We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man 
 We got a kindler gentler machine gun hand 
 Weve got department stores and toilet paper 
 Got styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer 
 Got a man of the people says keep hope alive 
 Got fuel to burn got roads to drive 
 Keep on rockin in the free worldIts a hopeless situation 
 And Im starting to believe 
 That this hopeless situation 
 Is what Im trying to achieve 
 But I try to run on 
 Its all or none 
 All or none 
 Heres the selfless confession 
 Leading me back to war 
 Can we help that our destinations 
 Are the ones weve been before 
 I still try to run on 
 But its all or none 
 To myself I surrender 
 To the one Ill never please 
 But I still try to run on 
 You know I still try to run on 
 All or noneTell me what I wanna hear 
 This shits too good to be true 
 My dear 
 Tell me lies 
 Tell me lies tell me 
 Help me help me help me 
 Storybook keeps from hurting me 
 You see 
 Shell of the man from the sea 
 Tell me why 
 Tell me why tell me 
 Reservoir of hate and fear 
 Invisible in repair 
 A hundred thieves cast a spell 
 This is hell 
 The man they call my enemy Ive seen his eyes 
 He looks just like me a mirror 
 The more you read weve been deceived 
 Everyday it becomes clearer 
 Clearer clearer 
 Not my enemy 
 No not my enemy 
 Dont speak for me 
 No not my enemySo bye bye Miss American Pie 
 Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry 
 Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
 Singin thisll be the day that I die 
 Thisll be the day that I dieI seem to recognize your face 
 Haunting familiar yet I cant seem to place it 
 Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name 
 Lifetimes are catching up with me 
 All these changes taking place 
 I wish Id seen the place 
 But no ones ever taken me 
 Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away 
 I swear I recognize your breath 
 Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising 
 Me you wouldnt recall for Im not my former 
 Its hard when youre stuck upon the shelf 
 I changed by not changing at all 
 Small town predicts my fate 
 Perhaps thats what no one wants to see 
 I just want to scream hello 
 My God its been so long 
 Never dreamed youd return 
 But now here you are and here I am 
 Hearts and thoughts they fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts they fadeMy lips are shaking my nails are bit off 
 Been a month since Ive heard myself talk 
 All the advantage this lifes got on me 
 Picture a cup in the middle of the sea 
 And I fight back in my mind 
 Never lets me be right oh 
 I got memories I got shit 
 So much it dont show 
 I walked the line 
 When you held me in that night 
 When you held my hand that night 
 An empty shell seems so easy to crack 
 Got all these questions dont know who I could even ask 
 So Ill just lie alone and wait for the dream 
 Where Im not ugly and youre looking at me 
 And Ill stay in a bed 
 Oh couldve seen it 
 If just once I could feel loved 
 Oh stare back at me yeah 
 But I walked the line 
 Oh I walked the line 
 When you held me close at night 
 I paid the price never held you in real lifeShe was an evil little goat goat goat 
 She was an evil little goat goat goat

 And she was an evil goat goat goat 
 Baaaa

 As he opens the door she rolls over pretends to sleep as he looks her over 
 She lies and says shes in love with him 
 Cant find a better man 
 She dreams in color she dreams in red 
 Talkin to herself theres no one else who needs to know 
 She tells herself oh

 Swears she knew it now she swears hes gone 
 And she swears hes cool 
 She lies and says she still loves him

 Thats why shell be back again

 Two dozen other dirty lovers 
 Must be a sucker for it

 Sooner or later you hit the deck you get found out 
 Save it for later dont run away and let me down

 In an underwater nation yeah 
 And I surf in celebration oh 
 Of a billion adaptations yeah yeah 
 Got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave 
 I feel the need planted in me 
 Millions of years ago 
 Cant you see the oceans size 
 Defining time and tide arising 
 Arms laid upon me 
 Being so kind to let me ride 
 I scream in affirmation oh 
 Of connecting dislocations yeah 
 And exceeding limitation oh 
 By achieving levitation yeah 
 Got me a ride 
 OhThere must be some kind of way out of here 
 Said the joker to the thief 
 Theres too much confusion 
 I cant get no relief 
 Businessmen they drink my wine 
 Plow men dig my earth 
 None will level on the line 
 Nobody of it is worth 
 Hey Hey 
 No reason to get excited 
 The thief he kindly spoke 
 There are many here among us 
 Who feel that life is but a fucking joke but uh 
 But you and I weve been through that 
 And this is not our fate 
 So let us not talk falsely now 
 The hours getting late 
 Hey 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Barefoot servants to but Uh 
 Outside in the cold distance 
 A wild cat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 And the wind began to howl 
 Hear you sing around the watch 
 Gotta beware gotta beware I will 
 Yeah 
 Ooh baby 
 All along the watchtowerWhat used to be a house of cards 
 Has turned into a reservoir 
 Saved the tears that were waterfalling 
 Lets go swim tonight darling 
 And once outside the undertow 
 Just you and me and nothing more 
 If not for love I would be drowning 
 Ive seen it work both ways but I am up 
 Riding high amongst the waves 
 I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved 
 I can feel like Ive put away my early grave 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late 
 Remember back the early days 
 When you were young and and thus amazed 
 Suddenly the channel changed 
 The first time you saw blood 
 Cut to later now youre strong 
 Youve bled yourself the wounds are gone 
 Its rare when there is nothing wrong 
 Survived and youre amongst the fittest 
 Love aint love until you give it up 
 Up riding high amongst the waves 
 I can see the light coming through the clouds in rays 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late hey yeah 
 I got to say it now better loud than too late 
 Say it now better loud than too late 
 Hey yeahCant know whats high 
 Till you been down so low 
 The futures bright 
 Lit up with nowhere to go 
 To and fro the pendulum throws 
 We are here and then we go 
 My shadow left me long ago 
 Understand what we dont know 
 This might pass this might last this may grow 
 Easy come and easy go 
 Easy left me a long time ago 
 Im in the fire but Im still cold 
 Nothing works works for me anymore 
 Ah ah ah ah ah 
 To and fro the pendulum throws 
 to and fro 
 to and froIve got you and thats all I want 
 I wont forget cause thats a whole lot 
 When somethings wrong I feel uneasy 
 You show me tell me youre not teasin 
 I dont know why sometimes I get frightened 
 You can see my eyes and tell that Im not lying 
 Look at you youre a pageant 
 Youre everything that Ive imagined 
 I dont go out now that youre here 
 Sometimes we shout but thats no problem 
 Theres no doubt but when Im with you 
 When Im without I stay in my room 
 Where do you go I get no answer 
 Youre always out it gets on my nerves 
 You can see my eyes and tell that Im not lyingEí per noi un piacere augurarvi insieme it is a pleasure for us to wish you together 
 Ai rem un buon cetriolo with rem a merry christmas 
 I need a song to help along 
 When it feels wrong it seems so long 
 To get to the light 
 We live in homes talk on phones 
 Hear the tone can you hold 
 Moving fast as light TVs on at night 
 Does peace come out of fighting 
 Can truth come out of lying 
 Im happy when Im crying 
 If reality is what I see newspapers magazines TV 
 Tell us whats going on leading us along 
 Its not absurd to all get heard 
 Put our feelings into words 
 You have to reach inside no feelings to hide 
 Bring children into the world 
 We couldnt have done it by ourselves 
 Stop and wonder why 
 Theres more than meets the eyes 
 Somewhere inside I did believe 
 I cant belong I was wrong 
 I have gained insight 
 I will see the light 
 Truth isnt lying 
 Peace isnt fighting 
 Love isnt dyingI was drawn 
 Riding atop a black horse 
 Whatever past there was 
 I could only observe 
 Where the trouble starts 
 Where does it end 
 How can I be cured 
 How before it ends 
 I know life would be different 
 If I held on held on 
 I know I could be something 
 If I held on 
 Gave her life away 
 Put it in my pocket when it shoulda been framed 
 Oh it lost its shine 
 Gotta get this outta my head 
 Out of my bed 
 How could it end 
 End like this 
 How could it end 
 Had I held on held on 
 Held on held on 
 If I held on held onSometimes Im right then I can be wrong 
 My own beliefs are in my songs 
 A butcher a banker Jack Irons on drums 
 Makes no difference what group Im in 
 I am everyday people 
 Then its the blue ones who cant accept 
 The green ones for living with 
 The black ones tryin to be a skinny one 
 Different strokes for different folks 
 And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby 
 Ooh sha sha 
 We gotta live together 
 I am no better and neither are you 
 Were all the same whatever we do 
 You love me you hate me 
 You know me and then 
 Still cant figure out the scene Im in 
 Then its the new man 
 That doesnt like the short man 
 For being such a rich one 
 That will not help the poor one 
 And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby 
 We got to live together 
 There is a yellow one that wont 
 Accept the black one 
 That wont accept the red one 
 That wont accept the white one 
 And so on and so on and 
 Scooby dooby dooby 
 I am everyday peopleSo all you fools 
 Who sing just like him 
 Feel free to do so now 
 Cause hes dead 
 Using using using 
 The using takes toll 
 Isolation 
 Just so happy to be one 
 Sad to sad to think 
 Sad to think of him more 
 Lonesome friend we all knew 
 Always hoped youd pull through 
 No blame no blame 
 No blame it could be you 
 Using you cant grow old using 
 So sing just like him fuckers 
 It wont offend him 
 Just me 
 Because hes deadKnow a man 
 His face seems pulled and tense 
 Like hes riding on a motorbike 
 In the strongest winds 
 So I approach with tact 
 Suggest that he should relax 
 But hes always moving 
 Much too fast 
 Said hell see me on the flip side 
 On this trip hes taking for a ride 
 Hes been taking too much on 
 There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes 
 There he goes 
 Hes yet to come back 
 But Ive seen his picture 
 It doesnt look the same 
 Up on the rack 
 We go way back 
 I wonder about his insides 
 Its like his thoughts are too big for his size 
 Hes been taken 
 Where I dont know 
 Off he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes 
 There he goes 
 And now I rub my eyes 
 For he has returned 
 Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned 
 For he still smiles 
 And hes still strong 
 Nothings changed but the surrounding bullshit 
 That has grown 
 And now hes home 
 And were laughing like we always did 
 My same old 
 Same old friend 
 Until a quartertoten 
 I saw the strain creep in 
 He seems distracted 
 And I know just what is going to happen then 
 Before his first step 
 He is off againWhen somethings dark let me shed a little light on it 
 When somethings cold let me put a little fire on it 
 If somethings old I want to put a bit of shine on it 
 When somethings gone I want to fight to get it back again 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 When somethings broke I want to put a bit of fixing on it 
 When somethings bored I want to put a little excited on it 
 If somethings low I want to put a little high on it 
 When somethings lost I want to fight to get it back again 
 When signals cross I want to put a little straight on it 
 If theres no love I want to try to love again 
 I’ll say your prayers I’ll take your side 
 Ill find us a way to make light 
 Ill dig your grave well dance and sing 
 What say could be our last lifetime 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Uh uh uh uh 
 Yeah yeah yeahIts been two years 
 It feels like home 
 Things cant be the same 
 Wherever you go 
 I miss you 
 I dont know 
 If youre gonna call me at home 
 If I go I dont want to feel alone 
 Lets get away 
 Have some drinks 
 Light my smoke 
 Its all about the simple things 
 Lucky ones 
 They are all in love 
 With you I could never feel alone 
 Alone 
 AloneDont you think you oughta rest 
 Dont you think you oughta lay your head down 
 Dont you think you want to sleep 
 Dont you think you oughta lay your head down tonight 
 Dont you think youve done enough 
 Oh dont you think youve got enough well maybe 
 You dont think theres time to stop 
 Theres time enough for you to lay your head down tonight 
 Tonight 
 Let it wash away 
 All those yesterdays 
 What are you running from 
 Taking pills to get along 
 Creating walls to call your own 
 So no one catches you drifting off and 
 Doing all the things that we all do 
 Let them wash away 
 All those yesterdays echo 
 All those paper plates 
 Youve got time youve got time to escape 
 Theres still time its no crime to escape 
 Its no crime to escape its no crime to escape 
 Theres still time so escape 
 Its no crime crime 
 All those yesterdaysMy numbers up 
 My time has come 
 Sounds like theyre playing my song 
 On the altar 
 My picture 
 Will be there while Im gone 
 Therell be time for laughing 
 There is no time to cry 
 Soon I will be leaving 
 Look me in the eye 
 No matter whats in front of me 
 Its your face that Ill see 
 And the future of our young one 
 And this is what fuels me 
 Theres no time for laughing 
 Theres no time to cry 
 The oath I took 
 Not so seriously 
 The worlds gathered steam 
 And caught up with me 
 And my decisions been made 
 Some other place 
 By someone I dont know 
 And they dont know me 
 This is no time for laughing 
 Look me in the eyeI know about a man to whom I may be related hes leatherman 
 Died a long time ago in the 1880s leatherman leatherman 
 Covered with leather but it wasnt tight 
 Underneath the moon in the woods at night 
 Makin the rounds ten miles a day 
 Once a month theyd spot him heres what theyd say 
 Here he comes hes a man of the land 
 Hes leatherman Smile on his face an axe in his pack 
 Hes leatherman 
 Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed 
 Wasnt known to say but Thanks for the bread 
 So modern day I walk my way my jacket faded 
 Just like a man of leather whom I may be related 
 Rolled a cigarette but when he asked for a light 
 I thought hed be an animal but so polite 
 Makin the rounds ten miles a day 
 Once a month theyd spot him and heres what theyd say 
 Here he comes hes a man of the land hes leatherman 
 Smile on his face an axe in his hand 
 Shake his hand hes leatherman 
 Bake some bread hes leatherman 
 Shame hes dead I saw his bed 
 Its all thats left of leatherman 
 Give me some skin leathermanSailing on my every step 
 Inching off of the earth 
 Its magnified 
 By the things Ive done 
 The thing that Ive become 
 Every lift of my hand 
 Coffee cup up and back 
 Is magnified 
 The things Ive seen the things Ive caused 
 Im a dead man walking 
 The hammer that I once brought down now hovers over me 
 Casts a shadow a crossacross onto me 
 The hallways are all mocking me 
 What Ive become theyre all mocking me 
 Im a dead man walking A dead man walking A dead man walking 
 Im a dead man walking Dead man walking Dead man walkingOh please let it rain today 
 This citys so filthy 
 Like my mind in ways 
 Oh it was the time 
 Like a clean new taste 
 Smiling eyes before me inches from my face 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love yeah 
 Sin for sale buying just a need 
 All who planted all the devils seeds 
 And whats the truth 
 And the truth that lies at home 
 Its on the inside and I cant get it off yeah 
 Whats clean is pure 
 But hey Im white on the outside 
 Though I stray 
 What she dont know today 
 Might kill us both tomorrow 
 Bring it back some way 
 Bring it back back back 
 Back to the clean form 
 To the pure form 
 Wash my love eh 
 Wash my wash my 
 Wash my loveI had a dream the other night 
 You were in a bar in the corner on a chair 
 Wearing a long white leather coat 
 Purple glasses and glitter in your hair 
 And you said hey this is where Im gonna sit 
 And buy you a drink someday 
 You were going to the dog shows 
 But you kinda lost your way 
 You say now I got all this room 
 And no money to decorate it so some 
 Local customer put me in touch with the man 
 Upstairs he said little man you got no 
 Business gettin frustrated you gotta rest 
 You gotta rest you gotta reach down 
 And pick the crowd up 
 Carry back in your hands 
 To the promised land 
 Now I had some angel shine my wings she said 
 Nothin but the best for the golden boy 
 She made me promise not to tell I had her under 
 A spell singing golden words in a broken voice 
 And I caught some blessing on the wind Im 
 Feeling lighter than a whisper from a dove 
 Ive got no hands to tie behind my back 
 And Im sparking like a heart attack now Ive got 
 Room to spread my wings and my messages of 
 Love yes love was my drug but thats not 
 What I died of so dont think of me 
 Crying louder than some billion dollar baby 
 Cause I gotta rest I gotta rest I gotta 
 Reach down and pick the 
 Crowd up carry back in my 
 Hand to the promised landIm gonna save you fucker not gonna lose you 
 Feeling cocky and strong cant let you go 
 Too important to me

 Someday somedayThe fruit of love was in the future 
 Around the corner and over the hill 
 The act of love was slowly pounding slowly pounding slowly pounding 
 The Holy War was slowly building 
 Heroes leaving for the Great Crusade 
 Seek reward in the ever after ever after ever after

 Ive never slept in Satans bed 
 Although I must admit still visits my place 
 Uninvited as you know he dont wait 
 Funny how he always seems to fit in 
 Funny how I always want to give in 
 Sundays Fridays Tuesdays Thursdays the same 
 Sometimes the special guest he dont like to leave 
 Already in love 
 Already 
 Who made who made up made up the myth 
 That we were born to be covered in bliss 
 Who set the standard born to be rich 
 Such fine examples skinny little bitch 
 Model role model roll some models in blood 
 Get some flesh to stick so they look like us 
 I shit and I stink Im real join the club 
 Id stop and talk but Im already in love 
 In love ah ha ha ha 
 Follows torturefollows reward 
 Oh oh my butt 
 Never shook Satans hand look see for yourself 
 Youd know it if I had that shit dont come off 
 Ill rise and fall let me take credit for both 
 Jump off a cliff dont need your help so back off 
 Ill never suck Satans dick 
 Again youd see it you know right round the lips 
 Ill wait for an angel but I wont hold my breath 
 Magine theyre busy think Im doing okay 
 AlreadyBehind her eyes theres curtains 
 And theyve been closed to hide the flames remains 
 She knows their futures burning 
 But she can smile just the same same 
 And though her mood is fine today 
 Theres a fear theyll soon be parting ways 
 Standing like a statue 
 A chin of stone a heart of clay hey 
 And though hes too big a man to say 
 Drifting away drifting away drifting away away 
 Drifting away drifting away drifting away awayThought it was easy to fall in love but you you you 
 Youre different this much I know yeah you you you 
 It might be your guile It could be your mind 
 It might be the way you take your time 
 Oh you you you 
 You its you Its you you you 
 Oh you Its you Its you you you 
 I never know how much to say with you you you 
 I like to go deep but is it safe with you you you 
 It might be your needs It could be your eyes 
 It might be the way you sympathize 
 You Its you Its you you you 
 Oh you Its you Its you you you 
 You break laws and pay no fines You get yours and then get mine 
 I dont think its easy to stay in love 
 But you you you you 
 But you yes you Its you you you 
 You its you its you you you 
 Ah you 
 Its you x3 
 Ah you you you yes you 
 With you you you you ahHe came dancing across the water 
 With his galleons and guns 
 Looking for the new world 
 In that palace in the sun 
 On the shore lay montezuma 
 With his coca leaves and pearls 
 In his halls he often wondered 
 With the secrets of the worlds 
 And his subjects gathered round him 
 Like the leaves around a tree 
 In their clothes of many colors 
 For the angry gods to see 
 And the women all were beautiful 
 And the men stood straight and strong 
 They offered life in sacrifice 
 So that others could go on 
 Hate was just a legend 
 And war was never known 
 The people worked together 
 And they lifted many stones 
 They carried them to the flatlands 
 And they died along the way 
 But they built up with their bare hands 
 What we still cant do today 
 And I know shes living there 
 And she loves me to this day 
 I still cant remember when 
 Or how I lost my way 
 He came dancing across the water 
 Cortez cortez 
 What a killerExponentially serving 
 Perpetually unnerving 
 Vehicle swerving 
 The adjectives they are all a blurring 
 Freud walking the sidelines 
 Clipboard scoring the brain 
 Black magic painted traits 
 Makes me sane 
 Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman yeah 
 Please dont make me explain 
 Dont matter anyway 
 Phantom pain in my brain 
 Its all thats left of my leg 
 Black and red and yellow 
 Heard you repeat a what ya heard what ya heard 
 Me knowing the truth I cannot concur nana 
 Doesnt matter anyway 
 Yo bro 
 Tell us whats happenin 
 Um Im on the west west side of 
 On the west coast 
 Give me a jingle 
 Uh when you get in 
 From where the fuck youre at 
 Doesnt fucking matter anyway 
 Please dont make me explainPlease mother of mercy 
 Take me from this place 
 And the long winded curses 
 I hear in my head 
 Words never listen 
 And teachers oh they never learn 
 But Im warm from the candle 
 Though I feel too cold to burn 
 He came from an island 
 And he died from the street 
 And he hurt so bad like a soul breaking 
 But he never said nothing to me 
 Say hello to heaven heaven heaven 
 New like a baby 
 Lost like a prayer 
 The sky was your playground 
 But the cold ground was your bed 
 I said poor stargazer 
 Shes got no tears in her eyes 
 But smooth like a whisper 
 She knows that love heals all wounds with time 
 Now it seems like too much 
 Love is never enough 
 Yeah you better seek out another road baby 
 Cause this one has ended abrupt yeah yeah yeah 
 I never wanted 
 To write these words down for you 
 With the pages of phrases 
 Of all the things well never do 
 Yeah so I blow out out the candle 
 And I put you to bed 
 Since you cant say to me now 
 How the dogs broke your bone 
 Theres just one thing left to be said 
 Say hello to heaven heaven yeah yeah 
 Say hello to heaven heaven yeahFreezing 
 Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete 
 Again 
 Oh feeling 
 Maybe hell see a little better set of days ooh yeah 
 Oh hand out 
 Faces that he sees time again aint that familiar ooh yeah 
 Oh dark grin 
 He cant help when hes happy looks insane 
 Even flow 
 Thoughts arrive like butterflies 
 Oh he dont know 
 So he chases them away yeah 
 Ooh oh someday yet 
 Hell begin his life again 
 Life again 
 Kneelin 
 Looking through the paper though he doesnt know to read ooh yeah 
 Oh prayin 
 Now to something that has never showed him anything 
 Understands the weather of the winters on its way 
 Oh ceilings 
 Few and far between all the legal halls of shame yeah 
 Oh whispering hands 
 Gently lead him away 
 Him away 
 Whoo 
 Ah yeah 
 Fuck it up

 Come on just some spare change man I know you got 
 Well God bless you man God bless you 
 Ooh ah someday yet 
 Hell begin his life again yeah 
 Uh huh yeah 
 Yeah yeah mama mama yeahSpin me round 
 Roll me over 
 Fucking circus 
 Stab it down 
 One way needle 
 Pulled so slowly 
 Drains and spills 
 Soaks the pages 
 Fills their sponges 
 Its my blood 
 Paint Ed big 
 Turn Ed into one of his enemies 
 Stab it down 
 Fill the pages 
 Suck my blood dry 
 Maker of my enemies 
 Take my 
 Why why why why why why 
 RatsGREED 
 GREED 
 Its a disease and theyre all green 
 It emanates from their being 
 A satiation with occupation 
 And like weeds with big leaves 
 Stealing light from whats beneath 
 Where they have more 
 Still they take more 
 I know then I dont 
 Theres a stowaway with my throat 
 Its deceiving 
 I dont believe him 
 We can scream out our doors 
 Behind the wall a fat man snores 
 In his dreams hes 
 Choking tea leaves 
 Well I guess 
 Theres nothing wrong with what you say 
 But dont sell me 
 There cant be better ways 
 Tell the captain 
 The boats not safe and were drowning 
 Turns out 
 Hes the one making waves waves waves 
 But I said 
 Just asking you to sway 
 No white 
 Or black just grey 
 Can you feel this 
 World with your heart and not your brain 
 GREEDLast stop on the westcoast line 
 South of the northern border 
 One small corner on my mind 
 Everybody they know me there 
 Dont get any second glances 
 Chances are that they dont care 
 World as come undone 
 Like they change it everyday 
 Change dont come at once 
 Theres a wave building before it breaks 
 Cant wait for election day 
 Where the nasty occupation 
 Corporations rule the day 
 Playing on the pendulum throws 
 Farther out to the one side swinging 
 Has to sweep back the other way 
 The world has come undone 
 Another day and who can wait 
 Its a wave building before it breaks 
 All this hope and nowhere to go 
 This is how I used to feel but no more 
 Like a game that few can play 
 Change dont come from one 
 Its a wave building before it breaksUnderstand shes a force of nature 
 Contraband hiding deep inside her soul 
 Exorcising her will to lose control 
 She lets go 
 A common man he dont stand a chance no 
 Wonderland pulling 
 Alice 
 in the hole 
 No way to save someone who wont take the rope 
 And just lets go 
 One man stands the edge of the ocean 
 A beacon on dry land 
 Eyes upon the horizon 
 In the dark before the dawn 
 Hurricane has the trade winds blowing 
 A gale force shaking windows in the storm 
 Shipwreck on the rock that he calls home 
 With one light on 
 Somewhere theres a siren singing 
 A song only he hears 
 All the strength you might think 
 Would disappear resolving 
 One man stands alone awaiting 
 For her to come home 
 In dark before the darkness meets the dawn 
 Makes me ache 
 Makes me shake 
 Is it so wrong to think that love can keep us safe 
 Last I saw he was out there waiting 
 A silhouette in the black light full moon glow 
 In the sand there he stands upon the shore 
 Forevermore 
 All the strength that you might think 
 Would disappear resolving 
 Eyes are closed you cannot know 
 But his heart dont seem to roam 
 Oh ohHe won the lottery when he was born 
 Took his mothers white breast to his tongue 
 Trained like dogs color and smell 
 Walks by me to get to him 
 Police man police man 
 He won the lottery by being born 
 Big hand slapped a white male American 
 Do no wrong so clean cut 
 Dirty his hands it comes right off 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Jesus greets me looks just like me 
 Police man police man police man 
 All my pieces set me free human devices set me free 
 All my pieces set me free human devices set me freeArms Aloft 
 Sometimes theres no star shining 
 Scounting the edge of the universe 
 Sometimes you cant see the horizon 
 Between the ocean and the earth 
 And just when youre thinking about slinkin down 
 Im gonna pull you up  Im gonna pull ya round 
 May I remind you of that scene 
 The spirit is our gasoline 
 We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
 Let a million mirror balls beam 
 And you say  living aint nothing but hassles 
 In a Manilla envelope rain 
 And driving coal allnight to Newcastle 
 Its getting to be a repettetive strain 
 And just when youre thinking about 
 Going down the drain 
 They say the stars cant see their rays 
 Nor can they count their numbered days 
 No flower can says what perfume is 
 We got all this and bird and diz 
 May I remind you of that sceneVedder to Crowd 
 Im going to stand here with you Im going to give you a part I say Its OK and you say Its Ok 
 Its ok 
 Vedder and crowd Its ok 
 Its ok 
 Crowd Its ok 
 You dont have to run and hide away 
 You know I love you anyway 
 Its ok its ok 
 This is my chance this is my life 
 This is my hope in an alleyway 
 This is my chance this is my voice 
 There may be no more tomorrow 
 This my plea 
 This is my need 
 And my time of standing free 
 This is my step 
 This is my day 
 And the world is never the same 
 Its ok 
 Its ok  
 Its Okay 
 Oh Its kayFuck me in the brain 2x

 Newspapers matter not to me yeah

 Wave to all my friends yeah 
 They dont seem to notice me no 
 All their eyes trained on the street yo oh 
 Sidewalks cigarettes and scenes tempted 
 Up here so high I start to shake 
 Up here so high the sky I scrape 
 Im so high I hold just one breath here within my chest just like innocence 
 Eddies down in his home 
 Oh the blue sky its his home 
 Eddies blue sky home

 I swore I knew everything oh yeah 
 Lets say knowledge is a tree yeah 
 Its growing up just like me yeah 
 Im so light the wind he shakes 
 Im so high the sky I scrape 
 Im so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest sleep with innocence 
 Up here so high the boughs they break 
 Up here so high the sky I scrape 
 Had my eyes peeled both wide open 
 And I got a glimpse of my innocence 
 Got back my inner sense 
 Baby got it still got itMy spanking thats the only thing I want so much 
 My spanking thats the only thing I want so much 
 Thats the only thing I want so much 
 Dont you want people to love you 
 Thats the only thing I want so much 
 Why is that better than being hugged 
 Because you get closer to the person 
 Closer to the person 
 Just like a person having sex feels cared for 
 We wanna be loved so we have sex together 
 And they feel loved about that 
 And this is the way it makes me feel loved 
 I want it I dream about it I think about it I want it 
 Just like a girl wants sex with a boy you know 
 Its the way Ill always be probably 
 My last one was born in the system

 If you ever go to bed Ill kill you 
 Do I tell the whole world that Im mentally ill 
 Go to the papers yeah why not

 And I can still fantasize but I keep it to myself

 Do you ever think that you actually would kill yourself 
 Yes I believe I wouldMmm wide awake and he shakes in a panic 
 Never woke up alone ever before 
 Had his woman long as he can remember 
 Tries to forget but he cant he cant 
 Out of bed and he dreams in the shower 
 Shes standing naked hes apologizing 
 Reaches for her till his mind becomes blood hot 
 Woken up to be burned burned again 
 Go it alone 
 You got it so it goes 
 Got his knees to his face 
 He cant take it any other way 
 On the street hes walking wounded 
 Doesnt smile for the child at play 
 Thoughts of suicide and alleviation 
 Anything to get his heart off of the coals 
 Does he fly away or just talk about it 
 Like a seagull born to cry in the wind 
 Own experiences lead to a younger 
 All alone you will meet the one who lies in wait 
 You got it so it goes 
 Try to breathe but he cant 
 He cant take it for another day yeah yeah 
 I can help myself dont talk to me 
 I can help myself myself 
 I can help myself 
 Wide awake and he shakes in a panic 
 Tries to forget but he cant he cantNo I wont back down

 You can stand me up at the gates of Hell but I wont back down 
 I will stand my ground wont be turned around 
 I will keep my world from draggin me down I wont back down 
 Hey baby there aint no easy way out 
 Hey I will stand my ground 
 Oh I know whats right I got just one life 
 I wil keep this world from pushin me around Ill stand my ground 
 And I wont back down 
 And I wont back down no I wont back downVacate is the word 
 Vengeance has no place in me to hurt 
 Cannot find the comfort in this world 
 Artificial tears 
 Vessel stabbed next up volunteers 
 Vulnerable wisdom cant adhere 
 A truant finds home 
 And a wish to hold onto 
 But theres a trapdoor in the sun 
 Immortality 
 As privileged as a whore 
 Victims in demand for public show 
 Swept out through the cracks beneath the door 
 Holier than thou how 
 Surrendered executed anyhow 
 Scrawl dissolved cigar box on the floor 
 Theres a trapdoor in the sun 
 I cannot stop the thought 
 Of running in the dark 
 Coming up a which way sign 
 All good truants must decide 
 Oh stripped and sold mom 
 Auctioned forearm 
 And whiskers in the sink 
 Truants go on 
 Cannot stay long 
 Some die just to liveIn the moonlight 
 Gettin Wind out to get back Its a 
 Steady shore to her land 
 Its gettin closer to the fence 
 In the moonlight 
 Givin Two lost wings 
 A beautiful star sea 
 A wonderful sense of beauty 
 Its a love drawn nearer 
 Darkened days are spent in 
 A night bird is followin you all the time 
 Under a starlined ceiling 
 And darkness so sleep Ah 
 Your sense is revealed 
 A night bird is followin you its followin you 
 A night bird is followin you all the timeSeen it happen to a couple of friends 
 See it happen and the message it sends 
 Taking off for whats an obvious fall 
 Just to see what all the fuss is about 
 Its not your way 
 Not your way 
 Another habit says its in love with you 
 Another habit says its loves overdue 
 Another habit like an unwanted friend 
 Im so happy with my righteous self 
 Never thought youd habit 
 I never thought youd never thought youd 
 I never thought youd never never thought youd 
 Speaking as a child of the 90s 
 I never thought you Never thought you 
 I never thought you Never never thought you 
 Never Never me Never you Never meI dont mind all the guys dancing with my girl 
 Thats fine I know them all pretty well 
 And I know sometimes I must get out in the light 
 Better leave her behind where the kids are alright 
 The kids are alright 
 Sometimes I know I gotta get away 
 Bells chime I know I gotta get away 
 And I know if I dont Ill go out of my mind 
 I know if I go things would be a lot better for her 
 I had this plan but her folks wouldnt let her 
 I dont mind I feel I gotta get away 
 And I know if I dont Ill go out of my fuckin mind 
 The kids are alrightHold on to the thread 
 The currents will shift glide me towards 
 You know somethings left 
 And were all allowed to dream of the next 
 Uh 
 Of the next time we touch 
 You dont have to stray the oceans away 
 Waves roll in my thoughts 
 Hold tight the ring 
 The sea will rise 
 Please stand by the shore 
 Oh oh 
 Oh I will be 
 I will be there once more 
 Uhhuh oh 
 Uhhuh ohTalk of circles punching out 
 Looking in drawing circles down 
 Falling off the south marking ground 
 Talking out of turn drawing circles down 
 Like Pilate I have a dog 
 Walks me out of town still ones a crowd 
 Making angels in the dirt looking up looking all around 
 Like Pilate I have a dog obeys listens kisses loves 
 Stunned by my own reflection 
 Its looking back sees me too clearly 
 And I swore Id never go there again 
 Not unlike a friend that 
 Politely drags you down you down you down you down 
 Like Pilate I have a dog obeys listens kisses loves x4And out isnt perfect 
 My friends Ill say it too 
 Stay my case of which Im certain 
 Ive lived a life as full 
 Ive travelled each and every highway 
 Oh and more as more gets 
 I did it my way 
 Regrets Ive had a few 
 But theyre too few to mention 
 I did what I had 
 Its all through without exemption 
 I play each charted course 
 Ive travelled each and every byway 
 And more much more than this 
 I did it my way 
 Well twice Im sure you knew 
 When I bit off more than I could chew 
 I knew it all without a doubt 
 I ate it up and I had to spit it out 
 I passed it on and I stood tall 
 And I did it my wayIve seen puzzles made out of wood 
 Ive seen games with pieces and rules 
 Ive decipered a trick or two at the bar 
 But theres a lot I havent figured out this far 
 Ive come up with riddles and jokes about war 
 Ive figured out numbers and what balance sheets are for 
 Ive understood feelings and Ive understood words but the mystery remains 
 I miss you 
 You are never more beautiful than at the end of the day 
 When the world is away 
 Oh this way 
 We can all run away 
 We cant all disappear 
 At the end of the day 
 You come back here 
 Here 
 Its been a long long day 
 And its hard to say Im just a drunk 
 Oh just a drunk 
 If you can imagine words 
 All that remains 
 Oh still Im just drunk 
 A puddle in the parking lot 
 And the worlds away 
 Oh we can all run away 
 But we cant all disappear 
 You come back here 
 From far away 
 But at the end of the day 
 We come back here 
 Back here

 Its rare to come upon a bridge that has not 
 Been around or been stepped on 
 Whatever the notion we laced in our prayers 
 The man upstairs whos used to all of this noise 
 Im through with screaming 
 And echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes 
 Like echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes like 
 Were faithful we all believe we all believe it 
 Echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes 
 So faithful we all believe we all believe 
 MYTH is belief in the game 
 Controls that keeps us in a box of fear 
 We never listen voice inside 
 So drowned out drowned you are you are you are everything 
 And everything is you 
 Me you you me its all related 
 Whats a boy to do 
 Just be darling and I will be too 
 Faithful to youUnderneath this smile lies everything 
 All my hopes and anger pride and shame 
 Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past 
 Just for today I am free 
 I will not lose my faith 
 Its an inside job today 
 I know this one thing well 
 I used to try to kill love was the highest sin 
 Breathing insecurity out and in 
 Searching hope Im shown the way to run straight 
 Pursuing the greater way for all human light 
 How I choose to feel is how I am 
 Holding on the light of night 
 On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul 
 Let me run into the rain 
 To be a human light again 
 To shine a human light today 
 Life comes from within your heart and desire 
 Oh life comes from within my heart and desire 
 Oh life comes from within your heart and desire 
 Run in rainOh tonight began with anything 
 Shaft of a light a warm breath and a scream ah yeah 
 Oh tamper if you like between the doors oh yeah uh huh

 WhyDoctor said I Id be all right 
 Oh everything that I believed it wasnt true

 I thought you were different like a dream 
 Things they aint never what they seem whoa 
 Thought I could trust you with my soul 
 But you cant do that anymore 
 The doctor said Id be all right but I still feel blue 
 The doctor said Id be all right but I still love you 
 Love you hate you 
 Love you want you hate you 
 Ah yeah 
 Im different 
 Me myself Im different than all the rest 
 I can only speak for myself but people can trust meYoure always saying that theres something wrong 
 Im starting to believe its your plan all along 
 Death came around forced to hear its song 
 And know tomorrow cant be depended on 
 Seen the home inside your head 
 All locked doors and unmade beds 
 Open sores unattended 
 Let me say just once that 
 I have faced it a life wasted Im never going back again 
 I escaped it a life wasted Im never going back again 
 Having tasted a life wasted Im never going back again 
 The world awaits just up the stairs 
 Leave the pain for someone else 
 Nothing back there for you to find 
 Or was it you who you left behind 
 Youre always saying youre too weak to be strong 
 Youre harder on yourself than just about anyone 
 Why swim the channel just to get this far 
 Halfway there why would you turn around 
 Darkness comes in waves 
 Tell me why invite it to stay 
 Youre one with negativity 
 Yes comfort is an energy 
 But why let the sad song play 
 Oh I escaped it a life wasted Im never going back again 
 Oh I erased it a life wasted Im never going back againI want for to lay down 
 Im waiting till sundown uh 
 Im searching the haystacks 
 Water is sunshine 
 Wait for the moment 
 The moment between us 
 The fire is made now 
 Harder to touch 
 I wanted to get right 
 With it with you 
 Bakers dozen parades 
 Stand and debate 
 Out single file 
 Nine in a row 
 Swear if you must 
 Keeping your boots on 
 Float with the now 
 Hot to the touch 
 Concrete underground 
 Cast out everyday 
 Dregs of society 
 Underbelly 
 Inside of me 
 Rejoice and follow thee 
 With it with you woohoo 
 With you 
 I wanted to get right with

 Oh yeah 
 Uh huh I got a feeling 
 I think that everybody knows oh yeah 
 Yeah wow I got a feeling

 Though we never saw the sunshine 
 Everybody had a wet dream

 Everybody had one line 
 Everybody misses Andy 
 Well be seeing him in no time 
 Ooh yeah I got a feeling yeah 
 A feeling deep inside oh yeah yeah

 A feeling I cant hide oh no no 
 Yeah I got a feeling yeah 
 Yeah ah ooh yeahJohnny Guitar Watson staring at me 
 Riding on 3 wheels a woman on his knee 
 With a leg under a red dress I wish I could see 
 Further north a warmth alive and lingering 
 Now Johnny he be having lots of women 
 The reason he be smiling known to him 
 On the left the girl in red so innocent 
 Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed 
 Yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin 
 Cant help but wonder where and who she is 
 And the memory is always getting clearer 
 For thats 30 years and more Ive loved her so 
 And how I need to know why shes with him 
 And I sleep with the light on in case she comes 
 And I sleep with the light on in case she 
 Recently as I was waiting on a dream 
 She came to visit lost and lonely me 
 Oh she leaned over the bed  with her lips above my head 
 She asked if I had seen her Johnny 
 Oh and I hide my disappointment 
 Cause for years I have been hoping 
 Oh yeah I had been hoping 
 That when she came she would come for me 
 I hide my disappointment cause for years I had been hoping 
 That when she came shed be coming just for me 
 Ill hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping 
 That when she came shed be coming just for meWe had this bright idea one late summer night 
 Candycoated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door 
 I guess the heat got to it dripped and melted all over the floor 
 Chocolatecovered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard 
 I had to laugh not to cry 
 Now all your possessions all of your things all of your hopes schemes desires and most of all your dreams 
 All gone away gone away 
 All gone away 
 Live for today you said live for today 
 I had to laugh not to cry not to cryShe lived on the curve in the road 
 In an old tar paper shack 
 On the south side of the town 
 On the wrong side of the tracks 
 Sometimes on the way into town 
 Wed say Mama can we stop and give her a ride 
 Sometimes we did 
 But her hands flew from her side 
 Wild eyed Crazy Mary 
 Down the long dirt road past the parsons place 
 That old blue car we used to race 
 Little country store with a sign tacked to the side 
 Said No LOITERING Allowed 
 Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd 
 Take a bottle drink it down pass it around 
 Take a bottle drink it down drink it 
 Pass it around pass it a 
 Atake a bottle drink it down pass it 
 Pass it a pass it around 
 One night thunder cracked 
 Mercy backed outside her windowsill 
 Dreamed I was flying high above the trees over the hills 
 Looked down into the house of Mary 
 Terrible thoughts newspaper covered walls 
 And Mary rising up above it all 
 Next morning on the way into town 
 Saw some skid marks and followed them around 
 Over the curve 
 Through the fields 
 Into the house of Mary 
 That what you fear the most could meet you halfway 
 Take a bottle drink it down pass it a pass it around 
 Pass it a 
 Pass it around 
 Pass it a pass it aThe waiting drove me mad 
 Youre finally here and Im a mess 
 I take your entrance back 
 Cant let you roam inside my head 
 I dont want to take what you can give 
 I would rather starve than eat your bread 
 I would rather run but I cant walk 
 Guess Ill lie alone just like before 
 Ill take the varmints path 
 Oh and I must refuse your test 
 Push me and I will resist 
 This behaviors not unique 
 I dont want to hear from those who know 
 They can buy but cant put on my clothes 
 I dont want to limp for them to walk 
 Never would have known of me before 
 I dont want to be held in your debt 
 Ill pay it off in blood let I be wed 
 Im already cut up and halfdead 
 Ill end up alone like I began 
 Everything has chains 
 Absolutely nothings changed 
 Take my hand not my picture 
 Spilled my tincture 
 I would rather starve than eat your breast 
 All the things that others want for me 
 Cant buy what I want because its free 
 Cant be what you want because Im 
 Aint supposed to be just one 
 Oh to live and die let it be done 
 I figure Ill be damned 
 All alone like I began 
 Its your move now 
 I thought you were a friend 
 But I guess I I guess I hate youI can feel the dawn 
 I can feel the Earth 
 I can feel the living 
 All around round round round 
 I could choose a path 
 I could choose the word 
 I can start the healing 
 Bring it now now now now 
 Bring it now now now 
 Whispered songs inside the wind 
 Breathing in forgiveness 
 Like vibrations with no end 
 Hear the planet humming 
 What is clear far from the noise 
 Get swallowed whole 
 I could feel the sun 
 I can see the sound 
 I could set myself right here 
 And drown drown drown drown 
 Drown drown drown 
 I can feel the rush 
 I could clear the clouds 
 I could set the needle 
 Spin it loud loud loud loud loud 
 Loud loud loud loud 
 I can hear the crash 
 I can feel the pound 
 I can feel the current 
 Pulling down down down down 
 Down down down down 
 Feel the planet humming 
 Gets swallowed whole 
 With no quiet to be found 
 Spirit lifted off the ground 
 And what lies beyond the grave 
 Might be welcome change 
 Time will come come what may 
 With no rest in peace 
 Until that day hey yeah 
 Now now now now 
 I could be the sun 
 I can be the sound 
 And drown Drown drown drown 
 Drown drown drown drown 
 And the chapter Ive not read 
 Turn the pageConsider me an object 
 Put me in a vacuum 
 Free of all conditions 
 Free of air and friction 
 Yeah Ill be hanging upside down 
 And there I will swing for all eternity 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah next stop falling 
 Comatose with no fear of falling 
 Consider me an abscess 
 Leave me in my vacuum 
 Blood on all the pistons 
 Running my transmission 
 High above Ill break the law 
 If its illegal to be in love 
 Leave the hatred on the cross 
 And here I will swing for all eternity 
 Something never thought youd be part ofYeah I been dreaming of getting along 
 Now I am awake dreaming keep it on keeping on 
 I catch a break then a punch to the head 
 I smile big with a toothless grin yeah 
 Supersonic gone  took my soul 
 I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeah 
 Supersonic truth be told 
 I dont need you to live to ever let you go 
 Yeah Ive been thinking I already know 
 Nothing bout nothing or so I have been told yeah 
 Im not the paper Im more like the fold 
 I cut the crease and put the shit in the hole 
 Supersonic gone and took my soul 
 I dont need you to live to ever let you go yeah 
 Supersonic gonna feel it now 
 I need to hear it need to feel it loud yeah 
 I wanna live my life with the volume full 
 I wanna live my life with the volume full yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeahWell shes walking through the clouds 
 With a circus mind 
 Thats running wild 
 Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams 
 And fairytales 
 Thats all she ever thinks about  
 Riding with the wind 
 When Im sad she comes to me 
 With a thousand smiles 
 She gives to me free 
 Its alright she says 
 Its alright 
 Take anything you want from me 
 AnythingOnce divided and nothing left to subtract 
 Some words when spoken cant be taken back 
 Walks on his own with thoughts he cant help thinking 
 Futures above but in the past hes slow and sinking 
 Caught a bolt of lightning 
 Cursed the day he let it go 
 Nothingman 
 Isnt it something 
 She once believed in every story he had to tell 
 One day she stiffened took the other side 
 Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell 
 One just escapes ones left inside the well 
 And he who forgets 
 Will be destined to remember 
 Oh she dont want him 
 Oh she wont feed him 
 After hes flown away 
 Oh into the sun ah into the sun 
 Burn burn 
 Couldve been something 
 OhSorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette 
 Thinks hell get the girl hell only get the mechanic 
 Whats missing 
 Hes living a day hell soon forget 
 Thats one more time around the sun is going down 
 The moon is out but hes drunk and shouting 
 Putting people down hes pissing 
 Counts his money every morning 
 The only thing that keeps him horny 
 Locked in a giant house thats alarming 
 The townsfolk they all laugh 
 Sorry is the fool who trades his love for high rise rent 
 Seem the more you make equals the loneliness you get 
 And its fitting 
 Hes barely living a day hell soon forget 
 Thats one more time around and there is not a sound 
 Hes lying dead clutching Benjamins 
 Never put the money down hes stiffening 
 Were all whistling a man well soon forgetYesterdays how quick they change 
 All lost and long gone now 
 Its hard to remember anything 
 Moving at the speed of sound 
 Moving with the speed of sound 
 And yet I’m still holding tight 
 To this dream of distant light 
 And that somehow I’ll survive 
 But this night has been a long one 
 Waiting on a sun that just dont come 
 Can I forgive what I 
 Cannot forget and live a lie 
 I could give it one more try 
 Why deny this drive inside 
 Just looking for some peace 
 Everytime I get me some it gets the best of me 
 Not much left you see 
 Waiting on a word that never comes 
 A whisper in the dark 
 Is that you or just my thoughts 
 Im wide awake and reaching out 
 It’s gone so quiet now 
 Could it be I’m farther out 
 Moving faster than the speed of soundIve just seen a face 
 I cant forget the time or place where we just met 
 Shes just the girl for me 
 I want all the world to see weve met 
 Da da da dada da 
 Had it been another day 
 I might have looked the other way 
 Adn Id have never been aware 
 As it is Ill dream of her tonight 
 Oh yeah yes Im fallin 
 And she keeps callin me back again 
 X2Hey 
 Hey yeah uh 
 Sheets of empty canvas 
 Untouched sheets of clay 
 Were laid spread out before me 
 As her body once did 
 Oh all five horizons 
 Revolved around her soul 
 As the Earth to the sun 
 Now the air Ive tasted and breathed 
 Has taken a turn 
 Ooh oh and all I taught her was 
 Everything 
 Ooh oh I know she gave me all that she wore 
 And now my bitter hands 
 Chafe beneath the clouds 
 Of what was everything 
 Oh the pictures have 
 All been washed in black 
 Tattooed everything 
 I take a walk outside 
 Im surrounded by some kids at play yeah 
 I can feel their laughter 
 So why do I sear 
 Ooh oh and twisted thoughts that spin 
 Round my head 
 Im spinning oh Im spinning 
 How quick the sun can 
 Drop away 
 Cradle broken glass 
 All the pictures have 
 All the love gone bad 
 Turned my world to black 
 Tattooed all I see all that I am 
 All Ill be yeah 
 Uhhuh 
 Woo 
 I know someday youll have a beautiful life 
 I know youll be a star 
 In somebody elses sky 
 But why why why cant it be 
 Cant it be mine 
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 Oh ah yeah 
 Ah ooh hoo 
 Ah hey ah ah 
 Ha ha yeah ha 
 Ha ha ha ha ha yeah hey yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 Ah hey yeah 
 Ah ha ah ha 
 Ooh hoo 
 Ooh hooLonely drifter on the hill Why do I 
 One must have a heart of steel Why do I 
 Its not how you look but how you feel Why do I 
 You must have a heart of steel Why do I 
 Why do I keep fucking up 
 I can see you on the hill Why do I 
 All comatose but walking still Why do I 
 Flowing curves beneath your flowing gown Why do I 
 Oh only I can bring myself down Why do I 
 Why do I keep fuckin up 
 Bowmans pick and dogs that bite Why do I 
 Oh dogs that howl through the night Why do I 
 Oh broken leashes all over the floor Why do I 
 Keys left hanging in a swinging door Why do I 
 Why do I keep fucking upHow does he do it how do they do it uncanny and immutable 
 Blackout weaves its way through the city 
 I remember when you sang that song about today 
 Now its tomorrow and everything has changed 
 A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter 
 The aristocrat choir sings whats the ruckus 
 With onionskin plausibility of life 
 Changed changed chainsRestless soul enjoy your youth 
 Like Muhammad hits the truth 
 Cant escape from the common rule 
 If you hate something dont you do it too 
 Small my table sits just two 
 Got so crowded I cant make room 
 Oh where did they come from Stormed my room 
 And you dare say it belongs to you to you 
 This is not for you 
 Oh not for you not you 
 Scream my friends dont call me 
 Friends no they dont scream 
 My friends dont call 
 My friends dont 
 All thats sacred comes from youth 
 Dedication naive and true 
 With no power nothing to do 
 I still remember why dont you 
 Dont you 
 Oh never was for you fuck you 
 Oh this is not for you yeah you 
 Oh not for you 
 Oh youYou never listen to a word I said 
 You only seen me 
 For the clothes I wear 
 Or did the interest go so much deeper 
 It must have been 
 The length of my hair 
 The public image 
 What you wanted was never made clear 
 Behind the image was ignorance and fear 
 You hide behind this public machine 
 Still follow the same old scheme 
 Public image 
 Two sides to every story 
 Somebody had to stop me 
 Im not the same as when I began 
 I will not be a property 
 Its not a game of monopoly 
 You got what you wanted 
 The public image belongs to me 
 Its my entrance 
 My own creation 
 My grand finale 
 My goodbye 
 GoodbyeAll the photographs are peeling 
 And colors turned to gray he stayed 
 In his room with memories for days he faced 
 An undertow of futures laid to waste embraced 
 By the loss of one he could not replace 
 And theres no reason that she passed 
 And there is no god with a plan its sad 
 And his holiness is proof its sad 
 He could only love you its sad 
 The door swings to a passing fable 
 A fate we may delay we say 
 Holding on to live within our embrace 
 Eleven nights he laid in bed 
 Hoping that dreams will bring her back its sad 
 And his loneliness is proof its sad 
 Holding his last breath believing 
 Hell make his way 
 But shes not forgotten 
 Hes haunted 
 Hes searching for escape 
 If just one wish could bring her back its sent 
 He will always love you its sadShe dont wander indont wander in here she 
 She dont wander in heredont wander in here 
 The direction of the eye so misleading 
 The defection of the soul nauseously quick 
 I dont question our existence 
 I just question our modern needs 
 She dont wander indont wander in here she 
 She dont wander in here 
 I will walk with my hands bound 
 I will walk with my face blood 
 I will walk with my shadow flag 
 Into your garden garden of stone yeah 
 After all is done and were still alone 
 I wont be taken yet Ill go 
 With my hands bound 
 Into your garden garden of stone 
 I dont show 
 I dont share 
 I dont need yeah 
 What you have to give 
 Ooh I will walk with my hands bound 
 Into your garden garden of 
 I will walk into your garden 
 Garden of stone 
 I dont care 
 I dont need ow 
 Need to live 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huhShe said to me over the phone 
 She wanted to see other people 
 I thought well then look around theyre everywhere 
 Said that she was confused 
 I thought darling join the club 
 24 Years old midlife crisis 
 Nowadays hits you when youre young 
 I hung up she called back I hung up again 
 The process had already started 
 At least it happened quick 
 I swear I died inside that night 
 My friend he called 
 I didnt mention a thing 
 The last thing he said was be sound 
 Sound 
 I contemplated an awful thing I hate to admit 
 I just thought those would be such appropriate last words 
 But Im still here 
 And small 
 So small how could this struggle seem so big 
 So big 
 While the palms in the breeze still blow green 
 And the waves in the sea still absolute blue 
 But the horror 
 Every single thing I see is a reminder of her 
 Never thought Id curse the day I met her 
 And since shes gone and wouldnt hear 
 Who would care what good would that do 
 So I imagine in a month or 12 
 Il be somewhere having a drink 
 Laughing at a stupid joke 
 Or just another stupid thing 
 And I can see myself stopping short 
 Drifting out of the present 
 Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep 
 And there I am standing 
 Wet grass and white headstones all in rows 
 And in the distance theres one off on its own 
 So I stop kneel 
 My new home 
 And I picture a sober awakening a reentry into this little bar scene 
 Sip my drink till the ice hits my lip 
 Order another round 
 And thats it for now 
 Sorry 
 Never been too good at happy endingsIve used hammers made out of wood 
 I have played games with pieces and rules 
 Ive deciphered tricks at the bar 
 But now youre gone I havent figured out why 
 I figured out numbers and what theyre for 
 Ive understood feelings and Ive understood words 
 But how could you be taken away 
 And wherever youve gone and wherever we might go 
 It dont seem fair today just disappeared 
 Your lights reflected now reflected from afar 
 We were but stones your light made us stars 
 With heavy breath awakened regrets 
 Back pages and days alone that could have been spent 
 Together but we were miles apart 
 Every inch between us becomes light years now 
 No time to be void or save up on life 
 Oh you got to spend it all 
 It dont seem fair you seemed to like it here 
 We were but stones your light made us starsHes got a big gold ring which says Jesus Saves 
 And its dented from the punch thrown at work that day 
 When he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things 
 After the big boss say 
 You best be on your way 
 So this life is sacrifice 
 Jumping trains just to survive 
 Well his wife and kids asleep but hes still awake 
 And his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid 
 Gets up lights a cigarette hes grown to hate 
 Thinking if he cant sleep how will he ever dream again 
 So this life is sacrificed 
 To a strangers bottom line 
 Ive seen the light oho oh oh oho oh oh 
 Im scared alive 
 Nearly dead 
 Oho oh oh oho oh ohh 
 Ive seen the light 
 Still alive 
 Was a dream that had to die 
 Near to death 
 Oho oh oh oho oh oh 
 Scared alive 
 Oho ohhh ohhhhh oooohoooo 
 Im here to die 
 Here to die 
 Scared of lifeAll in all its no ones fault 
 excuses turn to carbon walls 
 Blame it all on chemical intercourse 
 The swallowed seeds of arrogance 
 Breeding in the thoughts of ten 
 Thousand fools who fight irrelevance 
 The full moon is dead skin 
 The one down here is wearing thin 
 So set up the ten pins 
 As the human tide rolls in 
 Like a ball thats spinning 
 Bombs dropping down 
 Overhead underground 
 Its instilled to wanna live 
 Bombs dropping down 
 Please forgive our hometown 
 In our insignificance 
 Turn the jukebox up 
 he said 
 Dancing in irreverance 
 Play C3 let the song protest 
 The plates begin to shift 
 Perfect lefts come rolling in 
 I was alone and far away 
 When I heard the band start playing 
 On the lip late take off 
 Feel like resonance of distance 
 In the blood the iron lies 
 In our insignificanceYou ever heard the story 
 Of Mr Faded Glory 
 Say he who rides a pony must someday fall 
 I been talkin to my alter 
 Says life is what you make it 
 And if you make it death well then rest 
 Your soul away 
 Away away yeah 
 Its a broken kind of feeling 
 Shed have to tie me to the ceiling 
 A bad moons a comin 
 Better say your prayers 
 I wanna tell you that I love you 
 But does it really matter 
 I just cant stand to see you dragging down 
 Again again again 
 So Im singing 
 This is my kinda love 
 Its the kind that moves on 
 Its the kind that leaves you alone 
 Its the kind and leaves me alone 
 I used to treat you like a lady 
 Now youre a substitute teacher 
 This bottles not a prayer not a prayer in sight 
 I owe the man some money 
 So Im turnin over honey 
 Oh Mr Faded Glory is once again doin time 
 Its the kind that leaves me alone 
 Its a crown of thorns 
 Its the kind that 
 Like a crown of thorns 
 Its all who you know 
 So dont burn your bridges cause 
 Someday yeah 
 Start singing 
 Its the kind that leaves me aloneIts not the same without you up here 
 Cant find my wheels 
 Your absence is what breeds this fear 
 Warm breath and all it steals 
 You cant know how it feels to be in here 
 All the dark horse fields befriendin me 
 Playin aint the same without you here 
 Weve come to hate the golden rule 
 Cannot seem to make the dots connect 
 The morning light dont show you near 
 You cant know what its like to bleed from here 
 The blackened world goes white it goes nowhere 
 Ooh Hoo x4 
 Death aint the same without you dear 
 I make the others run and hide 
 New York streets seem to make it worse 
 All this noise inside the quiet 
 I cant hold on the weight you bear 
 My bodys broken fast please lift me up 
 You cant know what its like to be inside 
 Your fading melodies cant beat my need 
 Im not the same without you here 
 How can I quit to be there 
 Sit and stare 
 Stare 
 Begging for a prayerThere is a marker no one sees it cause of sand 
 That has covered over all the messages it kept 
 From misunderstanding what original truth was 
 And now expanding in a faith but not in love 
 What went wrong 
 Walking tightrope high over moral ground 
 Seeing visions of falling up somehow 
 Oh do come down with the living 
 Let what is living love 
 So unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first 
 God what do you say 
 Those undecided neednt have faith to be free 
 And those misguided there was a plan for them to be 
 Now you got both sides claiming Killing in Gods name 
 But God is nowhere to be found conveniently 
 What goes on 
 Walk the bridges before you burn them down 
 Do come round with the living 
 Unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first 
 I feel a sickness a sickness coming over me 
 Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea 
 And the solution Well from me far would it be 
 But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me 
 What goes wrong 
 Oh do come down with the living 
 Let what is living love unforgiving 
 Yet needing forgiveness first 
 Oh what do you say 
 What do you say 
 Calling out calling out 
 Calling out calling outSittin in the mornin sun 
 Ill be sittin till the evenings done 
 Watchin the ships roll in 
 Then I watch em roll away again 
 Sittin on the dock of the bay 
 Watchin the tide roll away 
 Wastin time 
 I left my home in Georgia 
 Headed for the Frisco Bay 
 Ive got nothin to live for 
 Looks like nothings gonna come my way yeah 
 Looks like nothings ever gonna change 
 Everything still remains the same 
 I cant do what ten people want me to 
 So I guess Ill remain the same oh 
 Sittin on a roll in my bones 
 This loneliness wont leave me alone 
 2 000 Miles Ive roamed 
 Just to make this dock my home yeah 
 Im sittin on the dock of the bay 
 Sittin here restin my bones 
 This loneliness wont leave me alone yeah 
 Wastin timeI should have known there was someone else 
 Down below I always kept it to myself 
 Now I believe in nothing 
 Not today 
 As I move myself out of your sight 
 Ill be sleeping by myself tonight 
 I could never go with no one else 
 The hurt dont show but who knows 
 Time will tell 
 But the pain 
 And I cant see this turning out right 
 Oh Ill be sleeping by myself tonight 
 Forever be sad and lonely 
 Forever never be the same 
 I close my eyes wait for a sign 
 Am I just waiting in vain 
 Oh I believe in love and disaster 
 Sometimes the two are just the same 
 Im beginning to see 
 Whats left of me 
 Is gonna have to be free to survive 
 I believe in nothing 
 Oh Ill be sleeping by myself 
 Ill be sleeping by myself 
 Ill be sleeping by myself tonightTheres a light when my baby is in my arms 
 Theres a light when the window shades are drawn 
 Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her 
 Wash it off cause this feeling we can share 
 And I know shes reached my heart in thin air 
 Byzantine is reflected in our pond 
 Theres a cloud but the water remains calm 
 Reaching in the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass 
 Even out its a precious thing to bear 
 Yes I know shes reached my heart in thin air 
 Its not in my past to presume 
 Love can keep on moving in both directions 
 How to be happy and true 
 Is the quest were taking on together 
 Taking on on on on on 
 Theres a light when my babys in my arms 
 Yes I know shes reached my heartAngel 
 Like an angel fly over your house 
 Like an angel pass out wishes 
 Like an angel I remove the arrow 
 Like an angel I live alone 
 Im not livin what was promised 
 I am close but cant enjoy 
 Oh Im not dyin 
 Oh Im so tortured cause I see all 
 Tortured and all I cannot do 
 Tortured all I should have done 
 Tortured while I occupied a man 
 I am far from glorified 
 Oh Im not alone 
 Mine is not a celestial state with idle hymns of praise 
 Time is short I have an appointment at noon at noon in Hell 
 Across the waste of space and fields of air I glide alone at night 
 Oh please please think of me cause Im Im by your side 
 Im by your side Im by your side oh 
 Im Im right in front of you Im by your sideI got an unfortunate feeling 
 I been beaten down 
 I feel that Im done believing 
 Now the truth is coming out 
 What theyre taking is 
 More than a vow 
 Theyre taking young innocents 
 And then they throw em on a burning pile ah yea 
 And all along theyre saying 
 Mind your manners 
 I caught myself believing 
 That I needed God 
 And if its out there somewhere 
 We sure could use hymn now 
 Try my patience 
 My patience tried 
 This worlds a long love letter 
 That makes me want to cry ah ah eh eh 
 Thats all theyre saying 
 Selfrealized and metaphysically redeemed 
 May not live another life 
 May not solve our mystery 
 Right round the corner 
 Could be bigger than ourselves 
 We could will it to the sky 
 Or we could something else 
 Always praying 
 Go to heaven 
 thats swell 
 How you like your living in Hell 
 How you like your living Hell 
 How you like your living HellShe scratches a letter 
 Into a wall made of stone 
 Maybe someday another child 
 Wont feel as alone as she does 
 Its been two years and counting 
 Since they put her in this place 
 Shes been diagnosed 
 By some stupid fuck 
 And mommy agrees yeah 
 Why go home 
 She seems to be stronger 
 But what they want her to be is weak 
 She could play pretend 
 She could join the game boy 
 She could be another clone 
 Ooh ow 
 What you taught me 
 why go home 
 Put me here 
 Dont come visit 
 Mother sing it 
 Oh why go home 
 Mother Mother yeah 
 WhyIm questioning my education 
 Is my education all I am now 
 While youre deciding Ive been finding 
 Looking around in the here and now 
 If Id been taught from the beginning 
 Would my fears now be winning 
 Im questioning my own equation 
 Is my own equation relevant somehow 
 The flags will wave and the news is breaking 
 See the man who came forgot his own tie 
 A wild world figured out the answers 
 Ill be in my own dancing out ouout yeah 
 Im questioning my education 
 Rewinding what does it show 
 Could be the truth it becomes you 
 Im a seed wondering why Im grown12341234 
 Whos got the brain of JFK 
 Whats it mean to us now yeah 
 Pause it sounds distrust 
 But I can tell ya this is no lie 
 The whole world will be different soon 
 The whole world will be relieved 
 You youve been taught whipped into shape 
 Now theyve got you in line eh 
 Stand behind the stripes 
 There will be order so give up your mind 
 Lend my name 
 The name they gave me 
 The name Im letting go 
 The whole world will be different 
 SoonJazz jazz jazz 
 Experiment of jazzAll my rivals will see what I have in store 
 My gun 
 Ive been harboring fleets in this reservoir 
 Red sun 
 And this nations about to explode 
 Your disciples are riddled with metaphors 
 Well hung 
 Better pony up and bring both your barrels full 
 Not one 
 As we release this unspeakable toll wooh 
 Hows our mother to damn these contributors 
 With mud 
 How will the man who made chemicals difficult 
 Shed blood 
 Hows our father supposed to be told 
 I dont ohTwo dozen other dirty 
 Oh dont wanna be a sucker for it 
 Dont mean to cry to my mother 
 Ma just let me come let me come to a decision on it 
 Sooner or later

 Run away run away run away run away run away run away run away 
 Run away run away run away run away run away run away 
 Dont let me down 
 Dont let me downRoutine was the theme 
 Hed wake up wash and pour himself into uniform 
 Something he hadnt imagined being 
 As the merging traffic passed 
 He found himself staring down 
 At his own hands 
 Not remembering the change 
 Not recalling the plan 
 Was it 
 He was okay 
 But wondering 
 About wandering 
 Was it age 
 By consequence 
 Or was he moved by sleight of hand 
 Mondays were made to fall 
 Lost on a road he knew by heart 
 It was like a book he read in his sleep 
 Endlessly 
 Sometimes he hid in his radio 
 Watching others pull into their homes 
 While he was drifting 
 On a line 
 Of his own 
 Off the line 
 Off the side 
 By the by 
 As dirt turned to sand 
 As if moved by sleight of hand 
 And when he reached the shore of his clipon world 
 Organized his few things his coat and keys 
 Any new realizations would have to wait 
 Till he had more time 
 More time 
 A time to dream 
 To himself 
 He waves goodbye 
 Ill see you on the other side 
 Another man moved by sleight of handAll the thoughts you never see 
 Youre always thinking 
 Brain is wired brain is deep 
 Oh are you sinking 
 Feel the path of every day 
 Which road you taking 
 Breathing hard making hay 
 Yeah this is living 
 Look for love and evidence 
 That youre worth keeping 
 Swallowed whole in negatives 
 Its so sad and sickening 
 Feel the air up above 
 A pool of blue sky 
 Fill the air up with love 
 Oh black with starlight 
 Feel the sky blanket you 
 With gems and rhinestones 
 See the path cut by the moon 
 For you to walk on 
 Nothing left nothing left nothing there nothing left 
 See the waves on distant shores 
 Awaiting your arrival 
 Dream the dreams of other men 
 Youll be no ones rival 
 Dream the dreams of others then 
 You will be no ones rival 
 A distant time a distant space 
 Thats where were living 
 A distant time a distant place 
 So what you giving 
 What you givingYou are the hole in my head 
 I am the pain in your neck 
 You are the lump in my throat 
 I am the aching in your heart 
 We are tangled 
 We are stolen 
 We are living where things are hidden 
 You are something in my eye 
 And I am the shiver down your spine 
 You are on the lick of my lips 
 I am on the tip of your tongue 
 We are buried up to our necks in sand 
 We are luck 
 We are fate 
 We are the feeling you get in the golden state 
 We are love 
 We are hate 
 We are the feeling I get when you walk away 
 Walk away 
 You are the dream in my nightmare 
 I am that falling sensation 
 You are my needles and pins 
 I am your hangover morning 
 We are the feeling I get when you walk away 
 You are the hole in my head 
 You are the pain in your neck 
 I am the aching in your heartI have not been home since you left long ago 
 Im thumbing my way back to heaven 
 Counting steps walking backwards on the road 
 Im counting my way back to heaven 
 I cant be free with whats locked inside of me 
 If there was a key you took it in your hand 
 Theres no wrong or right but Im sure theres good and bad 
 The questions linger overhead 
 No matter how cold the winter theres a springtime ahead 
 I wish that I could hold you I wish that I had 
 Thinking bout heaven 
 I let go of the rope thinking thats what held me back 
 And in time Ive realized its now wrapped around my neck 
 I cant see whats next from this lonely overpass 
 Hang my head and count my steps as another car goes past 
 All the rusted signs we ignored throughout our lives 
 Choosing the shiny ones instead 
 I turned my back now theres no turning back 
 Mmmmmmm 
 I smile but who am I kidding 
 Im just walking the miles every once in a while get a ride 
 Im thumbing my way back to heavenOut here in the fields I fight for my meals 
 I get my back into my living 
 I dont need to fight to prove Im right 
 I dont need to be forgiven no no no no

 Sally take my hand 
 Well travel south cross land 
 The exodus is here 
 The happy ones are near 
 Its only teenage wasteland 
 Theyre all wastedClimbing over a mountains 
 Floating out on the sea 
 Far from lights of a city 
 The elements they speak to me 
 Whispering that life 
 Existed long before greed 
 Balancing the world 
 On its knee 
 Dont see some men as 12 empty 
 See them 12 full of shit 
 Thinking that were all but slaves 
 There aint gonna be 
 No middle anymore 
 Its been said before 
 The haves be having more 
 Yet still bored 
 Wont someone save 
 Wont someone save the world 
 World world 
 World worldDo you see the way that tree bends 
 Does it inspire 
 Leaning out to catch the suns rays 
 A lesson to be applied 
 Are you getting something out of this 
 Allencompassing trip 
 You can 
 Spend your time alone 
 Redigesting past regrets oh 
 Or you can come to terms and realize 
 Youre the only one who can forgive yourself for 
 Makes much more sense 
 To live 
 In the present tense 
 Have you ideas on how this life ends 
 Checked your hands and studied the lines 
 Have you the belief 
 That the road ahead 
 Ascends off into the light 
 Seems that needlessly 
 Its getting harder 
 To find an approach and a way to live 
 Are we getting something out of this allencompassing trip 
 You can spend your time alone 
 Or you can 
 Come to terms and 
 Realize Youre the only one 
 Who cannot forgive yourself for 
 In the present tenseHe could have tuned in tuned in but he tuned out 
 A bad time nothing could save him 
 Alone in a corridor waiting locked out 
 He got up out of there ran for hundreds of miles 
 He made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree 
 The wind rose up set him down on his knee 
 Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw 
 Delivered him wings Hey look at me now 
 Arms wide open with the sea as his floor 
 Oh  ah oh 
 Hes  flying Home 
 High Wide Home 
 He floated back down cause he wanted to share 
 His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere 
 But first he was stripped then he was stabbed 
 By faceless men well fuckers he still stands 
 And he still gives his love he just gives it away 
 The love he receives is the love that is saved 
 And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky 
 A human being that was given to fly 
 Flying Home 
 High Flying Home 
 Hes Flying Home 
 Oh oah HomeAlone

 That this is not enough 
 So get up get up and scream oh 
 Get up and scream ah ohI shut and locked the front door 
 No way in or out 
 I turned and walked the hallway 
 And pulled the curtains down 
 I knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around 
 But nothings sound nothings sound 
 I stayed where my last cap left me 
 Ignored all my rounds 
 Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls 
 Theyre upside down 
 I swallow my words to keep from lying 
 I swallow my face just to keep from biting I I 
 I swallowed my breath and went deep I was diving diving 
 I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened 
 Now Im in hiding yeah 
 Im in hiding yeah 
 Im in hiding 
 Its been about three days now 
 Since Ive been aground 
 No longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now 
 Its funny when things change so much 
 Its all state of mind 
 I swallowed my words to keep from lying 
 I swallowed my face just to keep from biting I I 
 I swallowed my breath and went deep I was diving I was diving 
 Now Im in hiding yeah 
 Im in hidingIve just seen a face 
 X2Oh where oh where can my baby be 
 The Lord took her away from me 
 Shes gone to heaven so Ive got to be good 
 So I can see my baby when I leave this world 
 We were out on a date in my daddys car 
 We hadnt driven very far 
 There in the road straight ahead 
 A car was stalled the engine was dead 
 I couldnt stop so I swerved to the right 
 Ill never forget the sound that night 
 The screamin tires the bustin glass 
 The painful scream that I heard last 
 Oh where oh where can my baby be 
 So I can see my baby when I leave this world 
 When I woke up the rain was pourin down 
 There were people standin all around 
 Somethin warm flowin through my eyes 
 But somehow I found my baby that night 
 I lifted her head she looked at me and said 
 Hold me darlin for a little while 
 I held her close I kissed her our last kiss 
 I found the love that I knew I had missed 
 Well now shes gone even though I hold her tight 
 I lost my love my life that night

 Happy birthday to you 
 Happy birthday dear Incomprehensible 
 Happy birthday to youHow long must she stand 
 Before the ground it gives way 
 To an endless fall 
 She can feel this war on her face 
 The stars on her pillow 
 Shes folding in darkness 
 Begging for slumber 
 Im not blind 
 I can see it coming 
 Looks like lightning 
 In my childs eye 
 Im not frantic 
 I can feel it coming 
 Violently shakes 
 My body 
 Her sons slanted 
 Always giving her the sideways eye 
 The empty chair where dad sits 
 How loud can silence get 
 And mom 
 She reassures 
 To contain him 
 But its becoming a lie 
 She tells herself 
 And anyone else 
 Father is risking 
 His life for our freedoms 
 Darling youll save me 
 If you save yourselfWell mom and dad said we could 
 So I did what I should 
 I hung my stocking on a wall 
 I didnt get a thing at all 
 I dont believe in christmas 
 Cause I didnt get nothin last year 
 Well stayin up late 
 To see santa clause fly 
 Well sure enough dont ya know 
 The fat boy didnt show 
 Well I tried to get a little kiss 
 From a pretty little miss 
 She slapped me down and said you jerk 
 Mistletoe doesnt work 
 Oh right 
 Well wakin up the reindeer 
 Makin little kids cheer 
 The reason that his nose shine 
 Santa gave him moonshine 
 Ah decorate the street light 
 People lookin to get right 
 One hand will slap ya back 
 The other one will take ya back 
 Cause I didnt get nothin but fearNo more upset mornings 
 No more tired evenings 
 This American dream 
 I am disbelieving 
 When the gas in my tank 
 Feels like money in the bank 
 Gonna blow it all this time 
 Take me one last ride 
 For the lights of this city 
 They only look good when Im speeding 
 I wanna leave em all behind me 
 Cause this time Im gone 
 Long gone 
 This time Im letting go of it all 
 So long 
 In the far off distance 
 As my taillights fade 
 No one thinks to witness 
 But they will someday 
 Feel like a question is forming 
 And the answers far 
 I will be what I could be 
 Once I get out of this town 
 They have lost all feeling 
 Gonna leave em all behind me 
 Yeah this time Im letting go of it all 
 Long gone Im letting go of it all 
 If nothing is everything 
 If nothing is everything Ill have it all 
 I am goneWatched from the window with a red mosquito 
 I was not allowed to leave the room 
 I saw the sun go down and now its comin up 
 Somewhere in the time between 
 I was bitten must have been the devil 
 He was just payin me a little visit 
 Areminding me of his presence 
 Lettin me know hes awaitin for me 
 Red mans your neighbor call it behavior 
 While youre climbing up slippery hills 
 Two steps ahead of him punctures in your neck 
 Hoverin just above your bed 
 Lettin me know hes awaitin hes awaitin for me 
 If I had known then what I know nowEveryone’s a critic looking back up the river 
 Every boat is leaking in this town 
 Everybodys thinking they can all be delivered 
 Sitting in a box like lost and found 
 But I found my place and it’s alright 
 We’re all searching for a better way 
 Get this off my plate it’s alright 
 I got my own way to believe 
 Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather 
 We all could use a sedative right now 
 Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle 
 All hands on deck sinking is the bow 
 And if you wanna have to pray its alright 
 We all be thinking with our different brains 
 Get yours off my plate its alright 
 Sometimes you find yourself 
 Having to put all your faith 
 In no faith 
 Mine is mine and yours wont take its place 
 Now make your getaway 
 Science says were making love like the lizards 
 Try and say that fossils aint profound 
 Simon says that we are not allowed to consider 
 Simon says 
 Standup Sitdown Youre out 
 But I found my place and its alright 
 Oh bearing witness to some stranger days 
 I got my own ways to believe 
 Being told to change your ways 
 Theres no way 
 Now make your getaway hey hey 
 Sometime you find yourself 
 For Gods sake 
 Now make your getawayOne two three four five against one 
 Five five against one 
 Said one two three four five against one 
 Five five five five five against 
 Torture from you to me 
 Abducted from the street

 And I am my fathers son 
 Yeah too bad he was a psychopath 
 And now Im the next in line

 Never got top dollar 
 But she gave us all our start 
 Can I get a reprieve 
 This gene pool drowning me 
 Can I get a release 
 Im a volunteer amputee 
 From the moment I fail 
 I call on DNA 
 Why such betrayal 
 Got me tooth and nail 
 Yeah hows about one conversation 
 With nothing else left to be had 
 With this your young long lost son 
 And his never had dear old dad 
 Oh forget the insemination 
 And for that Im supposed to be glad 
 What a pity you left us so soon 
 To climb your mountain of regret 
 This gene pool dark and deep 
 Can I volunteer amputee 
 I gotta set sail 
 Hoo 
 All the bright lights shining 
 As youre trying to breathe in thin air 
 Cannot forget your hiding 
 Collected wounds left unhealed 
 When every thought youre thinking 
 Sinks you darker than a new moon sky 
 The far away lights rising 
 In the whites of your eyes 
 Now father youre dead and gone 
 And Im finally free to be me 
 Thanks for all your fuckedup gifts 
 For which I got no sympathy 
 Now Im living in a war torn place 
 Hear the bombs a fifth Symphony 
 Thanks for this and thanks for that 
 I gotta let go legacy 
 Can I beg a release 
 Can I volunteer amputee

 Big hey now brother brother brother 
 Brother hey nowPrivacy is priceless to me 
 Privacy is priceless to me 
 Privacy 
 PrivacyCome you masters of war you that build all the guns 
 You that build the death place you that build all the guns 
 You that hide behind walls you that hide behind desks 
 I just want you to know I can see through your masks 
 You that never done nothing but to build and destroy 
 You play with my world like its your little toy 
 You put a gun in my hand then you hide from my eyes 
 And you turn and run farther as the fast bullets fly 
 Like Judas of old you lie and deceive 
 A world war can be won and you want me to believe 
 But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain 
 Like I see through the water that runs down my drain 
 You that fasten all the triggers for the others to fire 
 Then you sit back and watch while the death count gets higher 
 You hide in your mansion while young peoples blood 
 Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud 
 Youve thrown the worst fear that could ever be hurled 
 The fear to bring children into this world 
 For threatenin my baby unborn and unnamed 
 You aint worth the blood that runs in your veins 
 How much do I know to talk out of turn 
 You might say that Im young you might say Im unlearned 
 But theres one thing I know though Im younger than you 
 Even Jesus would never forgive what you do 
 Let me ask you one question is your money that good 
 Will it buy you forgiveness do you think that it could 
 Oh I think you will find when your death takes its toll 
 All the money you made will never buy back your soul 
 And I hope that you die and your death will come soon 
 Ill follow your casket in the pale afternoon 
 And Ill watch as youre lowered into your deathbed 
 And Ill stand on your grave til Im sure that youre deadDrifting drifting drifting away 
 I got myself a mansion then I gave it away 
 Its not the world thats heavy its just the things that you save 
 And Im drifting drifting away 
 Drifting drifting drifting along 
 I rid myself of worries and my worries were gone 
 I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog 
 Im just drifting drifting along 
 All the suitcoats say there is money to be made 
 They get so damn excited but I guess its their way 
 My road it may be lonely just because its not paved 
 Its good for drifting drifting away 
 Drifting drifting drifting uh huh 
 I feel like going back there but never for long 
 And Im just drifting drifting along 
 Drifting drifting along 
 Drifting drifting alongHave a drink theyre buying 
 Bottom of bottle of denial 
 Big guy big eye watching me 
 Have to wonder what it sees sin 
 Progress laced with ramifications 
 Freedoms big blur oh 
 Pull the innocent from a crowd 
 Raise those sticks them bring them down 
 If they fail to obey 
 Ah if they fail to obey yeah yeah 
 For every tool they lend us 
 A loss of independence 
 I pledge my grievance to the flag 
 Cause you dont give blood then take it back again 
 Oh were all deserving something more 
 Progress taste it invest it all 
 Champagne breakfast for everyone 
 Break the innocent when theyre proud 
 Raise those stakes then bring em down 
 Oh if they fail to obey 
 Pledge your grievance to the flag 
 Cause dont give blood then take it back again 
 Have a have a drink drink 
 I want to breathe part of the scene 
 I want to taste everyone I see 
 I want to run when Im up high 
 I want to run to the sea 
 I want to life to be 
 I just want to be 
 I will feel alive as long as I am freeYes its true shining wine 
 Go on leave with the morning light 
 My love on the wing at night she rides 
 Fade away where the sun cleared out 
 Yeah fade away 
 Little time in this life sometime it seems 
 Twilight world dark living dream 
 Feel how say no more but stay yeah 
 The love you are always yeah 
 Feel the motion with this song 
 Like a river churnin pullin 
 Oh fade away 
 You said where have you been for a hundred years 
 Out in the sky you fell beneath 
 Turnin down a road leads I know not where 
 Forever turnin back yeah 
 Like a river like anOn the edge a windowsill 
 Ponders his maker ponders his will 
 To the street below 
 He just aint nothin 
 But hes got a great view 
 And he sinks a needle deep 
 Oh cant touch the bottom 
 In too deep yeah 
 Whoa on the edge of a knownothing town 
 Feeling quite superior the aged come 
 To the sky above 
 And he sinks a burning knife deep 
 Cant touch the bottom 
 Uhhuh cant touch the bottom 
 In too deep 
 On the edge of a Christmas clean love 
 Young virgin from Heaven visiting 
 To the man above her 
 She just aint nothing 
 She doesnt like the view 
 But he sinks himself deep oh 
 In too deep hey 
 Oh cant touch the bottom cant touch the bottom 
 Deep yeah 
 Touch the bottom cant 
 Touch the bottom yeah

 Hail hail the lucky ones

 Are we going to the same place If so can I come 
 Its egg rolling thick and heavy 
 All the past we carry 
 Oh I could be new 
 You underestimate me 
 I sometimes realize I could only be as good as youll let me 
 Are you woman enough to be my man 
 Bandaged hand in hand 
 Black lining 
 On the run in a race that cant be won yeah 
 Oh hail hail the lucky ones 
 If youre my only one 
 So good you only one 
 I want to be your one 
 Enough you won your one your oneDont need a helmet got a hard hard head 
 Dont need a raincoat Im already wet 
 Dont need a bandage theres too much blood 
 After a while seems to roll right off 
 Theyre whipping 
 Dont need a hand theres always arms attached 
 I dont get behind I cant fall back 
 Why must we trust all these rusted rails 
 They dont want no change we already have 
 Dont mean to push but Im being shoved 
 Im just like you think weve had enough 
 I cant believe a thing they want us to 
 We all got scars they should have them too 
 Theyre whippingWhat the fuck is this world

 Could have heard your voice one last time 
 Daily minefield this could 
 Be my time by you

 Believed in miracles cause Im one

 Live like a fool thats what I was about 
 Oh I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and you 
 Oh Oh I believe in miracles 
 Tattooed your name on my arm 
 I always said my girls a good luck charm

 I close my eyes and think how it might be 
 The futures here today 
 Its not too late its not too late oh 
 I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and youWhy deny all the troubles when combined 
 With the missing links it dont feel like home now 
 That youre gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum 
 Youre always wishing and never here at home you 
 All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on 
 But the house is getting dark 
 And I dont want to know your past 
 But together share the dawn 
 And I wont need nothing else cause when were dead 
 We wouldve had it all 
 And I wouldnt falling from the sky tell you 
 Parachutes have opened now 
 Heaven knows if theres a ceiling 
 Come so low with the kneeling 
 Please know that that I got 
 All the friends Im needing before my lights go out 
 As the doors are closing now 
 And far away will be my home 
 And to grasp this I dont know 
 But I dont need 
 Further back and forth a wave will break on me today 
 And love 
 Wish the world could glow again with love 
 One cant seem to have enough 
 And war 
 Break the sky and tell me what its for 
 Ill travel there on my own 
 What a different life 
 Had I not found this love with youEvery beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all 
 Hanten outta Santa Fe when surf comes out tomorrow lets go 
 And hes always practicing his cowabunga call cowabunga 
 But hell never scramble when the big waves start to roll 
 Cause theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 Gremmie out of control 
 Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 The kids always know that gremmies talk is cheap 
 Ride the hulahan over the pipeline bonsai to saddle bowl 
 Oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep cowabunga 
 His board is always full of dings 
 Cause hes always doing stupid things 
 And theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of controlTheres a girl on a ledge shes got nowhere to turn 
 Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned 
 Now her life is on fire its no ones concern 
 She can blame the world or pray till dawn 
 But only love can break her fall 
 Break her fall 
 Yeah only love can break her fall fall 
 Its like she lost her invitation to the party on earth 
 And shes standing outside hating everyone here 
 Yeah shes her own disease crying to her doll 
 Only love can break her fall yeah

 And I was so young too blind to see 
 But anyway thats history 
 And I say history never repeats 
 And theres a light shining in the dark 
 Leading me on towards a change of heart

 The golds just not good enough 
 And I dont even think of the bronze 
 Im living my life for olympic platinum 
 Olympic dream my olympic theme 
 Ill sing like whitney sing like whitney 
 My olympic dreamI was born in a pool they made my mother stand 
 And I spat on that surgeon and his trembling hand 
 When I felt the light I was worse than bored 
 I stole the doctors scalpel and I slit the cord 
 I was a Catholic boy 
 Redeemed through pain 
 Not through joy 
 I was two months early they put me under glass 
 I screamed and cursed their children when the nurses passed 
 Was convicted of theft when I slipped from the womb 
 They led me straight from my mother to a cell in the Tombs 
 Repeat Refrain 
 They starved me for weeks they thought theyd teach me fear 
 I fed on cellmates dreams it gave me fine ideas 
 When they cut me loose the time had served me well 
 I made allies in heaven I made comrades in Hell 
 I was a Catholic child 
 The blood ran red 
 The blood ran wild 
 I make angels dance and drop to their knees 
 When I enter a church the feet of statues bleed 
 I understand the fate of all my enemies 
 Just like Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane 
 Repeat Refrain 
 I watched the sweetest psalm stolen by the choir 
 I dreamed of martyrs bones hanging from a wire 
 I make a contribution I get absolution 
 I make a resolution to purify my soul 
 They cant touch me now 
 I got every sacrament behind me 
 I got baptism 
 I got communion 
 I got penance 
 I got extreme unction 
 Ive got confirmation 
 Cause Im a Catholic child 
 The blood ran wild 
 Now Im a Catholic man 
 I put my tongue to the rail whenever I canI wish I was a neutron bomb for once I could go off 
 I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on 
 I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on 
 The Christmas tree I wish I was the star that went on top 
 I wish I was the evidence I wish I was the grounds 
 For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky 
 I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me 
 I wish I was as fortunate as fortunate as me 
 I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good 
 I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaros hood 
 I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun 
 I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on 
 I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on 
 I wish I was the verb to trust and never let you down 
 I wish I was a radio song the one that you turned up 
 I wish 
 I wishCome gather round people 
 Wherever you roam 
 And admit that the waters 
 Around you have grown 
 And accept it that soon 
 Youll be drenched to the bone 
 If your time to you 
 Is worth savin 
 Then you better start swimmin 
 Or youll sink like a stone 
 For the times they are achangin 
 Come writers and critics 
 Who prophesize with your pen 
 And keep your eyes wide 
 The chance wont come again 
 And dont speak too soon 
 For the wheels still in spin 
 And theres no tellin who 
 That its namin 
 For the loser now 
 Will be later to win 
 Come senators congressmen 
 Please heed the call 
 Dont stand in the doorway 
 Dont block up the hall 
 For he that gets hurt 
 Will be he who has stalled 
 Theres a battle outside and its ragin 
 Will soon shake your windows 
 And rattle your walls 
 Come mothers and fathers 
 Throughout the land 
 And dont criticize 
 What you cant understand 
 Your sons and your daughters 
 Are beyond your command 
 Your old road is 
 Rapidly again g 
 Please get out of the new one 
 If you cant lend your hand 
 The line it is drawn 
 The curse it is cast 
 The slow one now 
 Will later be fast 
 As the present now 
 Will later be past 
 The order is 
 Rapidly fadin 
 And the first one now 
 Will later be last 
 For the times they are achanginKeep on locking your doors 
 Keep on building your floors 
 Keep on just as before 
 Pay disasters no mind 
 Didnt get you this time 
 No prints left at the crime 
 Our ships come in and its sinking 
 Of everything thats possible 
 In the hearts and minds of men 
 Somehow it is the biggest things 
 That keep on slipping right through our hands 
 By thinking were infallible 
 We are tempting fate instead 
 Time we best begin 
 Here at the ending 
 Wanna third second chance 
 Put your faith in big hands 
 Pay no more than a glance 
 All good things come to an end 
 This could be good as it gets 
 Hows the view from the fence 
 You think we been here before 
 You are mistaken 
 When progress could be plausible 
 In reverse we curse ourselves 
 In the hearts and minds of men ay yeah 
 That keep on slipping right through our hands yeah 
 Oh we are tempting fate instead 
 Oh yeah yeah 
 Oh yeah oh yeah yeah 
 Keep on locking your doors 
 Keep on just as beforeTroubled souls unite

 Tunnel vision

 Please please please 
 Please dont you want me 
 Please dont go on meI felt the earth on Monday it moved beneath my feet 
 In the form of a morning paper laid out for me to see 
 Saw his face in a corner picture I recognised the name 
 Could not stop staring at the face Id never see again 
 Its a shame to awake in a world of pain 
 What does it mean when a war has taken over 
 Its the same everyday in a hell manmade 
 What can be saved and who will be left to hold her 
 The whole world world over 
 Its a world wide suicide 
 Medals on a wooden mantle next to a handsome face 
 That the president took for granted writing checks that others pay 
 And in all the madness thought becomes numb and naive 
 So much to talk about nothing for to say 
 Its the same every day and the wave wont break 
 Tell you to pray while the devils on their shoulder 
 Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save 
 Does not equate and the truths already out there 
 Looking in the eyes of the fallen 
 You got to know theres another another another another another way 
 Its the same everyday and the wave wont break 
 Tell you to pray while the devils on their shoulder 
 Its a world wide suicideI will light a match this morning so I wont be alone 
 Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone 
 Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend Im free to roam 
 Oh I will make my way through one more day in Hell 
 How much difference does it make 
 I will hold the candle until it burns up my arm 
 Oh Ill keep taking punches until their will grows tired 
 Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind 
 Hey I wont change direction and I wont change my mind 
 Ill swallow poison until I grow immune 
 I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room 
 How much difference 
 How much difference does it makeDont feel like home 
 Hes a little out 
 And all these words alone 
 Is nothing like your poem 
 Putting in inputting in 
 Dont feel like methadone 
 A scratching voice all alone 
 Its nothing like your baritone 
 Its nothing as it seems 
 The little that he needs its home 
 The little that he sees 
 Is nothing he can seize its home 
 One uninviting chromosome 
 A blanket like the ozone 
 All that he needs is home 
 The little that he frees 
 Is nothing he believes 
 Saving it for a sunny day 
 Something maybe two tone 
 Anything of his own 
 A chip off the corner stone 
 Whos kidding Rainy day 
 A one way ticket headstone 
 An occupations overthrown 
 A whisper through a megaphone 
 Is nothing he concedes its home 
 And all that he frees 
 A little bittersweet its home 
 The little that he sees its homeShe comes on like a stone 
 But you dont know where from she was thrown 
 Like a burning meteor from miles high 
 Looking for a place to land 
 She said 
 Have you got yourself some sand 
 And whatever you replied she took as yes 
 Now she comes after thee 
 With her newly planted seeds and soon 
 Youre prone down on your knees and there you dig 
 And then before you know the weeds are 
 Obesely overgrown with all the 
 Wild seed she sows in your sleep 
 You gotta know youll never let her go 
 Shes a lightning bolt 
 Lightning bolt 
 Always something and never nothing 
 Isnt that the way were taught to be To be 
 Flipping through the worn out pages 
 And stages when you knew not who to be 
 Until the lightning strike sets you free yeah 
 Crashing stormy waves erode her 
 Shoreline everyday until the 
 Castle of her ways turns to sand 
 She holds her lovely breast 
 As her birds fall from the nest 
 Flying towards the great northwest yeah yeah yeah 
 And with no repair in sight 
 There is no God with such might 
 As to open her world wide with subterfuge 
 And your death will soon arrive 
 As she finally decides 
 That all her problems they wont die with you 
 Ay yeah 
 Never let her go 
 Shes your lightning bolt 
 Shes true 
 Shes your rock hey oh 
 Uncontrollable like you
