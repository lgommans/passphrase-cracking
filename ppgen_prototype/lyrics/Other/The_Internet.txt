Drivin in my car 
 Damn near cut me off 
 Now youre in the fast lane 
 So you better not slow me down 
 And I refuse to change my direction 
 So you best make up your mind 
 Before I get caught in the intersection 
 And minor traffic lights 
 We said that wed make signals 
 Get right or get left 
 Dont seem like youre ready 
 So just get out of my way 
 Seventy in six 
 Dont tell me youre sorry 
 Just get out my lane 
 Slowin me down 
 And now were moving faster 
 Youre catching up to speed 
 And yes your car looks good to me 
 And you know it dont try to speed off 
 Like I didnt teach you well you know 
 Are you ready for the open road 
 Warning signs were there 
 But we never cared 
 So we crashed 
 And learned a lesson 
 And to take care of the damage 
 We need to admit that accidents happen 
 So if its cool with you 
 Ill just be on my wayYoure beautiful 
 You brighten up my day 
 And when your skin touches mine 
 I get goosebumps right away

 Planned with false hopes 
 Made your insecurities showed

 And with this change 
 She knows 
 I really hope that she knows 
 What she could be 
 Is out to be 
 Shes like the perfect daughter 
 Shes never had anything given 
 Werent careful 
 Now you have a son to hold 
 Is out to beI was rollin through the ghetto 
 In my Lincoln Continental 
 Blowin Kush smoke out the window 
 What you think my windows tint for 
 It go drastic 
 Measures in a tale so tragic 
 Follow formula 64 as you trail my tracks 
 Bitch theres nothin more pleasant than gettin paid on point 
 Pretty bitches with gold grills just to hold my joints 
 I make em plead 
 As the director says scene 
 New words dont say my name 
 I just make em say king 
 Four rings on that motherfuckin wood grain wheel 
 Raw Im Johnny Law but you should check my appeal 
 Once upon a time not too far back 
 There was a young wolf pack 
 That grew up in a lack 
 Syd left King 
 And Ace played Black Jack 
 Bitches be talkin shit 
 Thats how you end up smacked 
 Im after chips 
 And if we eating then Im after your bitch 
 Aint no cost just pimpin player 
 You should be after the risk 
 We winnin like there aint no other way to play the game 
 All I hang around is zeros 
 Figure my checks should look the same 
 I was rollin through the ghetto 
 What you think my windows tint foHer state of mind is constantly changing 
 To Hell and back 
 She drives switching lanes 
 Not knowing what she has till she knows where shes going 
 If she can just get past this traffic 
 She tries and tries to find peace of mind 
 But these days everythings in your face 
 So she stays sober in her mind 
 Blowin smoke in the sky 
 Cause its her only vice 
 I wonder why 
 She blows smoke in the air in the air in the air 
 Cause she dont give a fuck 
 She shaved off all of her hair of her hair of her hair 
 Some people seen the way she is changing 
 They dont know the struggles that she was raised with 
 So shut the fuck up 
 Just shut the fuck up 
 Stop thinking that you know everything 
 You dont and you never will so just let it go 
 And be free as long as youre kind 
 Then you can roll with the finest 
 So dont wonder why 
 NoWe can conquer the world 
 Just you and me no one else 
 Tell me if thats cool 
 What chu wanna do 
 Ah Oh 
 Guns drawn in an all black car 
 Bustin at all the lames 
 Who got something to say about us 
 We can rob this world blind 
 And maybe next time 
 Theyll think twice 
 Before they try fuckin with us 
 Just imagine what it be like be like 
 If you and me ruled everything 
 Would it be Cool 
 Or Would it be cool 
 Can you imagine what it be like be like 
 If we would conquer the world 
 Would you be down to roll with me 
 Like partners in crime 
 Till the end of time 
 Or would it be cool 
 Or Would it be coolBeen waiting all day for you honey 
 Stand up when youre talking to me 
 Been drinking whiskey I dont know what Im saying 
 But god damn I feel free 
 And I 
 Feel like Im out my mind 
 Im high 
 Dont pay attention to downside 
 As these days go bye go bye 
 While we praise no lie theres no lies 
 Never would have thought life would end up like this 
 Designer clothes seeing things the naked eye might miss 
 The mind it wanders I find that its harder 
 To realize what the fuck it is we doing on this earth its a curse 
 Excuse me mister can I get some info 
 You look pretty wise and Im just an ignorant mind 
 I heard that ignorance is bliss 
 So it is what it is 
 So it is what it isThey say that every day is a struggle 
 And it takes time 
 But do they do they have a clue 
 How do I do I tell the truth from a lie now 
 They try to say hello its goodbye tomorrow 
 Throw a little 
 Youll be all right youll be all right 
 Just think if things were perfect 
 Would it be worth it if even had all 
 So dont act like you cant take it 
 We were built to be greatless 
 I know how easy 
 I know how easy 
 It is to give up 
 It is easy give up 
 But dont let people 
 Dont let people 
 Hold you down 
 Hold you down 
 And I know sometimes 
 I know sometimes 
 That it will amaze you 
 That it will amaze you 
 But dont let it fade you 
 Dont let it fade you 
 Hold your ground 
 Hold your ground 
 Hmm 
 They say they say hmm 
 Why do we trust does we dont know 
 Theres no need to hide you know whats inside 
 Why do we hate when theres love to spare 
 Why dont we understand 
 That the only way to grow is make love 
 Would it be worth it if even had all 
 They say they say hmmTime and time again 
 Minded out my past 
 Damn its so familiar 
 That they hardly ever last 
 Now they tried tellin me 
 Messed up on my mind 
 Called and saved my pain 
 Got the ones youll never find

 Do you really love me baby

 Upside down cause its not how it seems 
 Intricacies making believe 
 Your diary is inside of me 
 Come fly with me way down below 
 And scream silently in the undertows 
 Its society that makes it hard to sleep 
 I close my eyes but I still see 
 The fire 
 I know that Ill never forget you girl 
 Cause I see you in my dreams 
 Its hard to tell whether or not I wanna know 
 Im thinking all the time and I guess it shows 
 Its tough for us to go back in time 
 To the night before everything was fine 
 When you talked to me and I talked to you 
 We watched pedophiles on the morning news 
 And the water dripped from my faucet top 
 If I collect it all could we get it back 
 Please 
 Baby will you forget about me 
 Youre at the front of mind 
 Sitting behind my eyes all the time 
 Cause I see you in my dreamsWhen I was young I 
 Fell in love with you 
 You were my balloon 
 When you left I 
 Called upon the rain 
 Now you sit in skies of grey 
 Hoped we meet another day 
 But you up and flew away 
 Im moving on 
 Told myself that one day Id find you 
 My red balloon my red balloon 
 Said dont fly away help me fly away 
 When I get older I plan to follow you 
 In my new hot air balloon 
 When Im bored I 
 I can get so high high high 
 In my champagne golden skySometimes we do things 
 Others dont understand 
 If they ask why 
 Just tell them that 
 Tellem that I love you babe 
 Tellem that I love you baby 
 Gonna tellem that I love you babe 
 Tellem that I love you babe 
 Tell em that I love you babe 
 Tell em that I love you baby 
 Love you babe 
 Love you babe 
 Im always gonna love you baby 
 Always gonna love you babyWhat happened to make you to make you start to hate me 
 I once was your heart worth love and you were my everything 
 Sometimes I wonder why I still try 
 Dont say its over 
 Cause we both know no ones perfect baby I feel like this could be worth it 
 Oh 
 Cause I havent felt much myself lately what I got to do to get back my lady 
 Oh oh oh ohOpen the door 
 I look you in your face realize I dont love you no more 
 You ask me why 
 Reoccurring thoughts of him are there 
 Youll never understand 
 You 
 You asked to be put on this level and I ignored you 
 And now I see 
  
 So the bong is where I stare 
 Girl You know I love you girl You know I care 
 Frank clouds 
 Seem to like to follow me around since I lost you 
 Ask me how 
 I could leave with something so small and unsure like I didnt love you anymore 
 But you 
 Pushed me to a level of insanity I know 
 Now all I ask 
 Is if I ever had a chance 
 Or were we never gonna last 
 Texting me I love you as you were getting digged down by and old flame 
 At least you asked first when you preferred to win home games 
 Fuck it Ill let her smile like everything that you do 
 For everything thing that you do and its a girl will in school 
 But as the moonlight crept in to her vacant room 
 She shes in the coup 
 Her naked breaking curfew nuts and zippers too 
 See ocean blue right after the hundredth argument 
 Dipped just as quick as you read 
 Quit the new beau and my crush hates me now 
 Im fifty states away so ask me about your day 
 If you listen to the album I sent you 
 You shouldnt expect an answer 
 And its 
 Shit Ill find some new bitches I think that you can turn 
 By any chance as it stands that you still want me 
 Ill be in the same state you left me in 
 Alone 
 Or maybe Ill be with a bad bitch and I will check you 
 And tell you that youre nothing special 
 But you are 
 But I probably wontLifes a mess 
 Minds in disarray 
 So are my clothes 
 As I undress 
 And pick an outfit for this sunny day 
 Cause its okay 
 I attempt 
 Not to let my optimism slip away 
 Cause as long as the sun is rising 
 We can get up and brighten 
 Somebodys day 
 Im shinin bright as the rays 
 Inside my soul 
 So maybe you feel it 
 Maybe you dont 
 Maybe you love it 
 Maybe you wont 
 Maybe the sunshine isnt enough 
 To heal your pain 
 So maybe you play 
 Or maybe you fold 
 Baby you stay 
 Baby go 
 Maybe you touch me 
 Ill be afloat 
 Or maybe well stop somewhere down the road 
 Put on some headphones sit at my home 
 Watchin the sun set 
 Shed its good light on me yeah 
 I obsess 
 Over things that shouldnt matter 
 But they do 
 And it affects me 
 In the worst possible way 
 But its okay 
 We forget 
 What a big part all the little things can play 
 And thats okay 
 Inside my soul
