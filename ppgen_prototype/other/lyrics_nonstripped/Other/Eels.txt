 Hoppin'long my porch 
 I know it sounds kinda sad 
 But what's it all for 
 Right now you're the only friend I have in the world 
 And I just can't take how very much 
 Goddamn 
 I miss that girl 
 Little Bird 
 You look all right 
 I'm sure it's not easy 
 Getting through your night 
 So tell me this can't be 
 How it's gonna end 
 Tell me my heart 
 Somehow 
 Dear God 
 It's gonna mend 
 Little Bird 
 I guess you're right 
 I can't let it take me out 
 Without a fight 
 Right now I can't see 
 Makin' sense of this world 
 I just can't take how very much 
 Goddamn 
 I miss that girlMy love is always just as she seems 
 A force of nature all her own 
 To be reckoned with 
 Whatever's wrong with me 
 Her kiss redeems 
 And it's all there in my dreams 
 In my dreams 
 My love is soaring 
 She glides through the sky 
 Hardly a warning she takes my hand 
 Says, 
 "Open your eyes." 
 We look down on the earth 
 And all its schemes 
 We laugh and it's all there in my dreams 
 In my dreams 
 We swoop down below the clouds 
 Destination unknown 
 And then she says, 
 "Let's go home." 
 My love is resting under a tree 
 She whispers softly in my ear 
 As she lay next to me 
 "That was the funnest day." 
 Her sad eyes beam 
 And it's all there in my dreams 
 In my dreamsNot much of a man 
 But still I am a man 
 And you bring out something inside me 
 A perfect little diamond 
 A fragile little fire 
 You're everything good in the world 
 To me 
 I want to protect you 
 (I want to protect you) 
 I want you to be safe and sound 
 At night in this world 
 Such a delicate girl needs someone 
 To look out for the wolves 
 I want to protect you 
 I say some stupid shit 
 Don't mean a word of it 
 You know I got a lot of love inside me 
 This world's an ugly place 
 For such a pretty face 
 They're comin' at you from all sides 
 But they gotta get through me 
 I want to protect you 
 (I want to protect you) 
 I want you to be safe and sound 
 At night in this world 
 Such a delicate girl needs someone 
 To look out for the wolves 
 I want to protect you 
 Not many understand 
 But i'm your biggest fan 
 The savage fools cannot appreciate 
 The miracle of you 
 How could it be true 
 You're everything good in the world 
 I want to protect you 
 (I want to protect you) 
 I want you to be safe and sound 
 At night in this world 
 Such a delicate girl needs someone 
 To look out for the wolves 
 I want to protect you 
 I want to protect you 
 Fellas, just look at her 
 (aw...) 
 We gotta keep an eye out on her behalf 
 (yeah)People talking sound like dogs 
 Barking through the trees 
 Making no sense at all 
 Meaning nothing to me 
 Mother Mary 
 Quite contrary 
 I did not mean to let you go 
 So quick 
 People talking crack me up 
 They don't have a little clue 
 What it's like to be me 
 What it's like to lose you 
 Mother Mary 
 I grow weary 
 I did not mean to let you go 
 So quick 
 People talking sound like dogs 
 Barking up the wrong tree 
 Take a good man down 
 And set the evil free 
 Mother Mary 
 Quite contrary 
 I did not mean to let you go 
 So quickShe’s a true original 
 Not some store bought rebel 
 She can find her own way home 
 You just have to let her 
 Whichever path she finds 
 It’s hers to take 
 And if she says she’s fine 
 You just have to wait for her 
 She’s an artist in the world 
 She composes from the heart 
 The finished song is always there 
 Well before she starts 
 And any time she might 
 Get the words wrong 
 You just turn it up and you 
 You sing along with her 
 And if a gun was pointed at her 
 I would stand between the bullet and her 
 And if not being with me is what makes her happy 
 I’d take that bullet too 
 Which ever path she finds 
 It’s hers to take 
 And if she says she’s fine 
 I’ll just have to wait for her 
 She’s a true originalAll the little children playin' in the yard 
 A sunny day for them nothing's really hard 
 But they don't know what it's like to wear 
 Shoes so big that people stare 
 All the little children forget my name 
 They're all to busy playin' their stupid game 
 But they have no clue what it is 
 To be inside of today's showbiz 
 I am a sad clown 
 My smile is upside down 
 No amount of make-up can conceil 
 The pain in my heart that I feel 
 Laughing fools at what I say 
 But know inside there's hell to pay 
 I am a sad clown 
 My smile is upside down 
 All the little children forget my name 
 All the little children forget my nameSaw a UFO in the sky last night 
 Makes me wonder if everything's gonna be all right 
 Searching the skyline for a little light 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 Been there all along to see you through 
 Saw a UFO and it made me cry 
 Could I be so stupid to think that I'm 
 Gonna be here forever? 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 Been there all along to see you through 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 Been there all along to see you through 
 Saw a UFO, then it disappeared 
 Made me wonder if it's gonna be back next year 
 Maybe I don't have anything to fear 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 Been there all along to see you through 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 All the love in the world inside of youI write the b-sides 
 That make a small portion of the world cry 
 I like the seaside 
 And singing songs that make you not wanna die 
 Throw a stone into the sea 
 And wait for it to come back to me 
 Better get out on the boat 
 'Cause someone told me that stones don't float 
 I like to sit out back 
 And look up at the squirrels in the trees 
 They don't like radio tracks 
 And they don't ever talk down to me 
 Throw a nut up in the tree 
 Gonna fall right back on me 
 Well, these guys know who they are 
 And what they need's in their own backyard 
 Hoo, hoo 
 I like to play in the snow 
 I stick my hand in, now where did it go? 
 It might be mighty cold 
 But that's all part of not doing what you're toldThere's nothing that I wanna do 
 More than get alone and be with you 
 Trouble with dreams is they don't come true 
 And when they do they can't catch up to you 
 You don't need a thing from me 
 But I, I need something big from you 
 'Cause you know I've got 
 An awful lot of big dreams 
 I'm walking down a lonely road 
 Clear to me now but I was never told 
 Trouble with dreams is you never know 
 When to hold on and when to let go 
 If you let me down it's alright 
 At least that leaves something for me 
 'Cause you know I've got 
 An awful lot of big dreams 
 This is the life that I must lead now 
 Crossing fingers and wiping brow 
 Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend 
 Something with no beginning has an end 
 You don't need a thing from me 
 But I need something big from you 
 'Cause you know I've got 
 An awful lot of big dreamsThe kids are screaming and the wife is crying 
 Sunday morning ain't no time to find 
 Things are breaking he is rabid he is riven 
 It's very clear that the kids are not alright 
 When grey told me that he didn't like my curtains 
 Just to sad, in [?] not keys 
 He turns some classic rock on the radio 
 And points the speakers right in my face 
 There's something strange going on over there 
 Somebody should call the cops I swear 
 I don't know what's going on for sure 
 Inside the nightmare next door 
 The walls are shaking with his mannin foot steps 
 Look out for vulcano, she's gonna blow 
 The kids are crying out I know that ain't please 
 It throws the christmas tree right out the window 
 There's something strange going on over there 
 Somebody should call the cops I swear 
 I don't know what's going on for sure 
 Inside the nightmare next door 
 It starts the day with the hit on the porche and 
 He wakes us up with a hackin [?] 
 He in some night on a basketball court 
 I'm tryina sleep you stupid git! 
 There's something strange going on over there 
 Somebody should call the cops I swear 
 I don't know what's going on for sure 
 Inside the nightmare next door 
 Somebody should call the cops I swear.Sundown on the sorry day 
 By night lights, the children pray 
 I know you're probably getting ready for bed 
 Beautiful woman, get out of my head 
 I'm so tired of the same old crud 
 Sweet baby, I need fresh blood 
 Ho, ow 
 The moon shines in the autumn sky 
 Growing cold as the leaves all die 
 I'm more alone than I've ever been 
 Help me out of the shape I'm in 
 After the fires, before the flood 
 My sweet baby, I need fresh blood 
 Ho, howoo 
 Whatever trepidation you may feel 
 In your heart, you know it's not real 
 In a moment of clarity 
 Summon an act of charity 
 You've got to pull me out of this mud 
 Sweet baby, I need fresh blood 
 Ho, howooo 
 Ho, howoooEverett 
 Millicent, don't blame yourself 
 Sweetheart, there's no one else more important to me than you 
 There's nothing that you need to do 
 To prove to me that you care, I know you do. 
 Millicent, just let 'em talk 
 'Cause this thing, it's a lock and no one's gonna make that untrue 
 There's nothing anyone can do 
 To change the way I feel about you and you know that's true. 
 Millicent, just lean on me 
 I know that I can be everything you need me to be 
 There's no wall that I can't crash through 
 There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you. 
 Millicent, don't blame yourself 
 Sweetheart, there's no one else in the world.A monk with a hard-on and a lavender robe 
 That scratches his thighs through the hat that he strode 
 As he follows a path filled with every desire 
 And mimics his footsteps and sets his prayers on fire 
 Well I too have chosen that which left no choice 
 To sing without loving, a solitary voice 
 To observe with passion each careful denial: 
 The protrusions which give my life meaning for a while 
 Sometimes I see you in berries and weeds 
 You're brushing your teeth with liquorice seeds 
 Standing too close, pulling your clothes 
 Smiling at God and the meaning of life grows 
 No and I'll never tell and I'll never know 
 What candles you light after the show 
 And I'll never tell and I'll never ask 
 The meaning of life after massScary little suicide bomber 
 On the way to paradise 
 Gonna take yourself and be with her 
 Killin' once and killin' twice 
 Well it's a real hard time 
 Singin' the paradise blues 
 Kinda hard to blame somebody 
 For goin' to a better place 
 For thinkin' there's some kinda magic 
 Up there past outer space 
 Well that's some crazy-ass shit 
 Singin' the paradise blues 
 I'm gonna walk these filthy streets 
 I'm gonna raise my head 
 I may not be in paradise 
 Woo, but I'm not dead 
 Ain't gonna fly blind 
 Singin' these paradise blues 
 Your contempt and your sarcasm 
 It's all so transparent 
 Why don't you give up the act now, kid 
 Woo, and let some love in? 
 Cause that's all that we got 
 Singin' these paradise bluesAre you one of the beautiful people? 
 Is my name on the list? 
 Wanna be of the beautiful people 
 Wanna feel like I'm missed 
 Hey you, with the walkie-talkie 
 I know my clothes are not right 
 I wish I had my own walkie-talkie 
 That reached to God every night 
 Everyone needs to be somebody 
 Everyone needs to find someone who cares 
 But I don't know if you know what I mean 'cause I'm 
 Never on your list 
 Are you one of the beautiful people? 
 Am I on the wrong track? 
 Sometimes it feels like I'm made of egg shell 
 And it feels like I'm gonna crack 
 Everyone needs to be somebody 
 Everyone needs to find someone who cares 
 But I don't know if you know what I mean 'cause I'm 
 Never on your list 
 I'm never on your list 
 I'm never on your listThree ghosts and I 
 Sitting on the couch last night 
 Catching up on all the time 
 It's been a while 
 Since we got together 
 And you know that it's often on my mind 
 So long ago 
 I left it in the dust 
 Well I was so young and dumb 
 Ran far away 
 But I have to admit 
 Sometimes I miss where I'm from 
 Let's have a drink 
 To everything that we went through 
 It wasn't always so bad 
 We can't forget 
 Each other's company 
 And all of the good times we had 
 So long ago 
 I left it in the dust 
 Well I was so young and dumb 
 Ran far away 
 But I have to admit 
 Sometimes I miss where I'm from 
 Three ghosts and I 
 Sitting on the couch last night 
 Catching up on all the time 
 It's been a while 
 Since we got together 
 And you know that it's often on my mind 
 So long ago 
 I left it in the dust 
 Well I was so young and dumb 
 Ran far away 
 But I have to admit 
 Sometimes I miss where I'm fromOh man, feels so nice 
 That was a long cold night 
 But then the sun came out 
 To thaw the ice 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygold 
 Oh look at her, she's got something to say 
 And I cant wait to hear it 
 Won't let her get away 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygold 
 Oh yeah, oh my goodness 
 You gotta love what's happening here 
 There ain't nothing for me to fear 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygold 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygold 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygold 
 Oṗen the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily, the merrygoldWell I just heard it the other day 
 My little lady got things she don't say 
 In front of me and I'm not to proud 
 She tells her friends my name is walking cloud 
 Well it sounds to me like an Indian name 
 And I'm not so sure that I want my fame 
 To hinge on the fact that I'm a bad egg 
 She says I'm like a big black cloud on legs 
 Well I'm not so bad I must defend myself 
 I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf 
 Well it's a crazy mixed up life 
 When it's hard for man and wife 
 To get along in a crowd 
 When you're walking cloud 
 Well I guess I can be such a bitter old fuck 
 And it's true that I've fallen on some pretty hard luck 
 But I think she's forgetting all the things we vowed 
 Ain't it wrong to call your man a walking cloud? 
 'Cause I'm not so bad I must defend myself 
 I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf 
 Well it's a crazy mixed up life 
 When it's hard for man and wife 
 To get along in a crowd 
 When you're walking cloud 
 Well I just heard it the other day 
 My little lady got things she don't say 
 In front of me and I'm not to proud 
 She tells her friends my name is walking cloudIn the yard, behind the church where 
 Butterflies and blackbirds search for 
 A safe place to rest the night away 
 We will go down to the brook and 
 Sit upon the overlook, then 
 Forget about the troubles of the day 
 We will walk among the graves of 
 Men long dead with presidents' names and 
 Listen to the water flow softly by 
 I will kiss you on the lips now 
 And as the sky grows dark we'll strip down 
 And let the water wash away all lies 
 In the yard, behind the church where 
 Butterflies and blackbirds perch on 
 Gray stones as the garden's growing dim 
 We will lay down on the ground and 
 Put our cheeks against the dirt down 
 Where it no longer matters where you've beenGuess I'm doing something wrong 
 Never feel right in these shoes 
 A pocket full of matches and a head full of flames 
 Got to warn you that I'm bad news 
 She tugs me in and then she screams 
 "One day you will have to choose. 
 Either take care of me or take care of you. 
 And don't pretend you're not bad news." 
 Come on now I'll take you home 
 You don't have a thing to lose 
 But stick around long enough and you'll find out 
 I am nothing but bad news 
 You can never change where you're from 
 No matter who I will accuse 
 Gonna get on with a better life 
 And one day I won't be bad news 
 It's the same every day when I wake up 
 It's the same in the way that you gave me up 
 In the middle of a swan dive 
 And I was soaring down perfect and slowSome folks ride like the wind 
 With the whispering pines to guide them 
 And the burning light inside them 
 Keeps them warm in the snow 
 Others fear the sounds they hear 
 Make bandito's out of mole-hills 
 Fill their hearts with porcupine quills 
 They're dead and buried long before they go 
 Charlton Heston movies are no longer in demand 
 His immortal soul my lay forever in the sand 
 The angels wouldn't take him up to heaven like he planned 
 'Cause they couldn't pry that gun from his cold dead hand 
 It takes a cold dead hand to decide to pull the trigger 
 It takes a cold dead heart and as near as I can figure 
 With your cold dead aim you're trying to prove your dick is bigger 
 But we know your chariot may not be swinging low 
 Cold dead hand - cold dead hand 
 Cold dead hand - cold dead hand 
 You're a big big man with an little bitty gland 
 So you need something bigger just to fill 
 Your cold dead hand 
 Imagine if the lord were here 
 And he knew what you've been thinkin' 
 Would his sacred heart be sinkin' 
 Into the canyon of dismay 
 And on the ones who sell the guns 
 He'd sick the vultures and coyotes 
 Only the devil's true devotees 
 Could profiteer from pain and fear 
 Charlton Heston movies are no longer in demand 
 His immortal soul my lay forever in the sand 
 The angels wouldn't take him up to heaven like he planned 
 'Cause they couldn't pry that gun from his cold dead hand 
 It takes a cold dead hand to decide to pull the trigger 
 It takes a cold dead heart and as near as I can figure 
 With your cold dead aim you're trying to prove your junk is bigger 
 But we know your chariot may not be swinging low 
 Cold dead hand - cold dead hand 
 Cold dead hand - cold dead hand 
 Cold dead hand - cold dead hand 
 You're a big big man with an little bitty gland 
 So you need something bigger with a hair-pin trigger 
 You don't want to get caught with your trousers down 
 When the psycho killer comes around 
 So you make your home like a thunderdome 
 And you're always packin' everywhere you roam 
 But the psycho's win no matter what you do 
 'Cause they're gonna buy way more guns than you 
 And while you're stumbling out of bed 
 They put five rounds in the back of your head 
 Or you get depressed 'cause the money runs out 
 Then you put your own shotgun in your mouth 
 And your kids walk in and they find you there 
 Like a headless stump in your underwear 
 And they move the gun and it kills them too 
 And your wife just doesn't know what to do 
 But she takes a hand grenade from her shoe 
 And she pulls the pin 
 And it's all on you 
 And your cold dead handShut up, you don't have to shout it 
 It's fucked up if you think about it too long 
 Feeling like I'm all used up 
 Half empty, it's a broken cup, that's all 
 You little fool, you could be happy 
 Come take my hand, we'll go for a ride 
 Shut up, you don't have to remind me 
 It's not enough to fully blind me from it 
 Feeling like a stupid asshole 
 Take me now, if this is it, this sucks 
 You little fool, you could be happy 
 Come take my hand, we'll go for a ride 
 Look up ahead, off in the distance 
 The sun is shining on the bright side 
 You little fool, you could be happy 
 Come take my hand, we'll go for a ride 
 Look up ahead, off in the distance 
 The sun is shining on the bright sideTake five, take five 
 Not gonna be alright 
 No, I'm not gonna be alright 
 Nothin' is alright now 
 I'm not gonna see the sun come up 
 When I'm goin' down 
 'Cause everyday I'm here 
 All I feel is sheer agony 
 Friends tellin' me that maybe I need 
 Some pychiatric help 
 Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you 
 Just how to get over it 
 But I look into the mirror 
 And all I see is age, fear 
 And agony 
 If i could just remember what it was like 
 When I was younger 
 Oh, the joy and happiness 
 Replaced with hunger 
 Now all I've got to show 
 For the seeds that didn't grow 
 Is agonyLook in the mirror, I am The Man 
 Mrs. Miller says I am The Man 
 Ask the birds singin', I am The Man 
 Everyone is a fan 
 A little walk through the neighborhood 
 People nod 'cause it's understood 
 Mr. Henry comes out to stand 
 A wave and shout-out to The Man 
 Ask the birds singin', I am The Man 
 By popular demand 
 The little skinhead with the tattooed face 
 Shows me a moment of style and grace 
 The old hippie with the tie-dye headband 
 Flashes a peace sign to The Man 
 Ask the birds singin', I am The Man 
 Well, I do what I can 
 The angry redneck in his pickup truck 
 Tips his hat and gives the thumbs-up 
 The New Age guy with the yoga mat 
 Blesses me with a pat on the back 
 The longhaired indie rock kid in a band 
 Looks through his hair and shakes my hand 
 The old homeless guy who smells like pee 
 Stops talking nonsense and says "Morning, E" 
 Ask the birds singin', I am The Man 
 It's all part of the plan 
 The thug rapper with the gold and chains 
 Puts in his grill and says "Good day" 
 The politician going door to door 
 Says "No vote means more to me than yours" 
 Ask the birds singin', I am The Man 
 You know I'd win if I ranI like your toothy smile 
 It never fails to beguile 
 Whichever way the wind is blowing 
 I like the way this is going 
 I like the color of your hair 
 I think we make a handsome pair 
 I can only see my love growing 
 I like the way this is going 
 I like to watch tv with you 
 There's really nothing I would rather do 
 Then maybe we can go to bed 
 And get up and do it all again 
 I like the way your pants fit 
 And how you stand and how you sit 
 Whatever seeds that you're sowing 
 I like the way this is going 
 I dont care about the past 
 None of it was made to last 
 It's not what who you've known, but who you're knowing 
 I like the way this is going 
 I like the way this is goingFeeling scared today 
 Write down "I am OK" 
 A hundred times the doctors say 
 I am OK 
 I am OK 
 I'm not OK 
 Skin is crawling off 
 Mopping the sweaty drops 
 Sticking around for this shit 
 Another day 
 Another day 
 Not another day 
 Pink pill feels good 
 Finally understood 
 Take me in your warm embrace 
 I am trying 
 I am tryingLiving lost has been the way 
 Since the day I came along 
 Drifting through the dead-eyed days 
 When every turn is wrong 
 And I knew it was the darkest road 
 That I'd never know just how 
 To travel on to get somewhere 
 But I thought I'd have some answers by now 
 Meaning to find meaning 
 In the most meaningless of times 
 Believing I believed in something 
 Beyond equals in time 
 And I opened up my heart and said 
 This much I'll allow 
 All who enter welcome in 
 And I thought I'd have some answers by now 
 Living lost is not the way 
 To go from here on out 
 Existing in the dead-eye age 
 Is not all it's about 
 And I may not have that far to go 
 I might make it somehow 
 The brightest lights may shine ahead 
 But I thought I'd have some answers by nowLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 Springfield's looking pretty dusty today 
 I see their dreams coming undone 
 The view from inside ward 9 affords this much 
 A town teeming with the unloved 
 Close the window and lock it so it's good and tight 
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost 
 Have a not-so-nice day 
 The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake 
 You know I think I'm gonna stay 
 Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say 
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

 Come visit me tonight at eight o'clock and then you'll see 
 How I am not the crazy one 
 (Voices tell me I'm the shit) 
 Twenty days go by and every day looks the same

 (I'm the shit)You know what? I'm in a good mood today 
 Well, I'm so happy it's not yesterday 
 Man it was brutal with plenty of tissues 
 I guess you could say that I had issues 
 Well it's looking good, I dug my way out 
 I'm changing up what the story's about 
 When the world stops making sense 
 Just takin' what you can get 
 When the people on the street 
 Start looking like silhouettes 
 When the words just sound like noise 
 I need a new alphabet 
 When the world stops making sense 
 I make a new alphabet 
 Small thinking people with their small thinking ways 
 I don't have time to hear what they say 
 This is my world, I'm staking my claim 
 Thanks for the invite, no thanks just the same 
 It's looking good now, full speed ahead 
 I'll live today, by tomorrow I'm dead 
 When the world stops making sense 
 Just takin' what you can get 
 When the people on the street 
 Start looking like silhouettes 
 When the words just sound like noise 
 I need a new alphabet 
 When the world stops making sense 
 I make a new alphabet 
 I see everything 
 It's crystal clear 
 It's here 
 You know what? I'm in a good mood today 
 Well, I'm so happy it's not yesterday 
 Man it was brutal, but it's all in the past 
 It's good to know that it don't have to last 
 When the world stops making sense 
 Just takin' what you can get 
 When the people on the street 
 Start looking like silhouettes 
 When the words just sound like noise 
 I need a new alphabet 
 When the world stoṗs making sense 
 I make a new alphabet

 Sitting back on the sissy bar 
 Went to Sev and got a drink 
 Wish I was driving in your daddy's car 
 And I looked up at the sky last night 
 And I thought I saw a bomb 
 And why won't you just tell me what's going on? 
 Riding down on Springhill Road 
 Meeting Alfred out in the woods 
 Dogs bark and mosquitoes bite 
 Scratching the itch that makes it feel good 
 And I looked into the mirror last night 
 All I saw was a pretty blonde 
 And why won't you just tell me what's going on? 
 Life is funny, but not "ha ha" funny 
 Peculiar I guess 
 You think I got it all going my way 
 Then why am I such a fucking mess? 
 Want a pony and a birthday cake 
 Want a party with a scary clown 
 Kneel down and bow to the princess 
 Kneel down for the queen of the town 
 And I looked up at the sky last night 
 And I thought I saw a bomb 
 And why won't you just tell me what's going on? 
 Tell me what's going onWoman driving, man sleeping 
 With a suitcase on the rack 
 White lines shooting by 
 On the pavement like the sky 
 Looking straight ahead into the black 
 Woman driving, man sleeping 
 There's no radio to play 
 Sitting with the map 
 Laying crumpled on her lap 
 Looking for the toll money to pay 
 Man sleeping is man dreaming 
 In a large apartment house 
 Walking and knocking on doors 
 Woman driving, man sleeping 
 Passing all the other cars 
 Searching in the black 
 But never turning to look back 
 A little metal box under the stars 
 Man sleeping is man dreaming 
 In a large apartment house 
 Walking and knocking on doors 
 Woman driving, man sleeping 
 Woman driving, man sleepingWhat I have to offer 
 Well, there's a lot 
 Now I'm a modest man 
 But look at all I got 
 For all the wear and tear 
 I look OK 
 I got good manners 
 And I make a good pay 
 And you know I'm all full of love 
 For you 
 What I have to offer 
 Well, there's so much 
 A caring nature and a 
 Tender touch 
 I got a pleasin' 
 Disposition 
 And I don't care about 
 Football or fishin' 
 And you know that I'm all full of love 
 For you 
 What I have to offer 
 Well, check it out 
 I've learned some things 
 And I know what it's about 
 I'm quite discerning and 
 I'm pretty smart 
 And it takes an awful lot to 
 Win my heart 
 But you know that I'm so full of love 
 For youA happy accident 
 Me running into you 
 Was off of my beaten path 
 Got lost from my crew 
 Out of my element 
 Lost hold of the wheel 
 I didn't anticipate 
 A pleasant ordeal 
 I was getting tired of 
 Always being alone 
 Good thing that I've always been so 
 Accident prone 
 What made me go that way? 
 Well, I really don't know 
 Who do I have to thank? 
 To what do I owe? 
 I was feeling so bereft 
 All my chances blown 
 Good thing that I've always been so 
 Accident prone 
 I was getting tired of 
 Always being alone 
 Good thing that I've always been so 
 Accident prone 
 A happy accident 
 Me running into you 
 Who do I have to thank? 
 To what do I owe?Sitting in the funeral parlor 
 On the night before the day 
 Think I mighta left the stove on 
 think I mighta left the door unlocked 
 I don't know if 
 The stores will all be closed when I get out 
 I don't know if 
 The chores will all be done when I get home 
 Sitting in the funeral parlor 
 Listen to the organ play 
 What if I forgot the trashcans 
 What if I forgot to telephone 
 I don't know if 
 I wrote the number down in my book 
 I don't know if 
 I can stand to stay here one more secondCame home tonight 
 And I felt like I'd die of loneliness 
 Strange, you think 
 Popularity 
 Looking for a simple life 
 Life ain't simple 
 I'm tired and sick 
 But I don't wanna be alone 
 I'll go to a party 
 But I don't really want to 
 For now I'm sitting out here on my porch 
 Writing in the dark air 
 Listening to my little black cat meow 
 Trying to vent some of the terrible passion 
 That's coursing through me 
 Something about you 
 Something about spending the afternoon 
 Asleep in your arms 
 I hate you 
 FuckerBuying the deluxe edition and all

 The brand new Eels bonus tracks 
 Hold on to your hatMy beloved monster and me 
 We go everywhere together 
 Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves 
 Gets us through all kinds of weather 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from livin' in a world that's so damn mean 
 My beloved monster is tough 
 If she wants she will destroy you 
 But if you lay her down for a kiss 
 Her little heart it could explode 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from livin' in a world that's so damn mean 
 La la la la la la la la 
 La la la la la laIf you're travelin' the north country fair, 
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, 
 Remember me to one who lives there, 
 For she once was a true love of mine. 
 If you go when snowflakes storm, 
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends, 
 Please see she has a coat so warm, 
 To keep her from the howling winds. 
 Please see if her hair hangs long, 
 It rolls and flows all down her breast, 
 Please see for me if her hair's hangin' down, 
 For that's the way I remember her best. 
 I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all, 
 Many times I've often prayed, 
 In the darkness of my night, 
 In the brightness of my of my day. 
 So if your'e travelin' the north country fair, 
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, 
 Remember me to one who lives there, 
 For she once was a true love of mine.If the world's a rotten place 
 You better just forget it 
 In the crowd just another face 
 Gonna make 'em regret it 
 Take a heart and squash it hard 
 Like a little grape 
 Push it down 'tween boot and ground 
 'Til it loses shape 
 And if you feel like you can't swim 
 When you're thrown in the lake 
 Just watch the bugs 
 Passin' by you as you 
 Slip under their wake 
 Again 
 If you let your feelings shine 
 You better cover 'em up, kid 
 Ain't no sense in wastin' time 
 Dream behind your eyelids 
 Take a heart and squash it hard 
 Like a little bug 
 Swig it down and spit it out 
 And kick it under the rug 
 And if you feel like you can't swim 
 When you're thrown in the lake 
 Just watch the bugs 
 Passin' by you as you 
 Slip under their wake 
 Again 
 Take a heart and squash it hard 
 Like a little ant 
 Scrape it off the sole of your shoe 
 On the welcome mat 
 And if you feel like you can't swim 
 When you're thrown in the lake 
 Just watch the bugs 
 Passin' by you as you 
 Slip under their wake 
 Again 
 Ooh 
 OohThat wind a-blowin' 
 It's getting strong 
 The rain a-fallin' 
 Been falling too long 
 The pressure in the clouds has changed 
 Death rattles our window panes 
 Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane 
 They tried to warn us 
 I didn't care 
 Said don't be stupid 
 Get out of there 
 But now I know it's much too late 
 Who will discover the remains? 
 Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane 
 Don't you see it? 
 We're goddamn fools 
 We always had to break the rules 
 That wind a-blowin' 
 It's getting strong 
 The rain a-fallin' 
 Been falling too long 
 The pressure in the house has changed 
 Death rattles our window panes 
 Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricaneI bought some rock star ashes 
 From the back of 
 Rolling Stone 
 I guess he wouldnt mind it 
 They couldn't sell his soul 
 The tiger in my tank 
 Is going to go extinct 
 And I'm not feelin so good myself 
 I think I'm on the brink of disaster 
 I had a dream last night 
 The TV and the phone 
 Grew some legs and took a walk 
 And left me all alone 
 The tiger in my tank 
 Is going to go extinct 
 And I'm not feelin so good myself 
 I think I'm on the brink of disaster 
 When I grow up I'll be 
 An angry little whore 
 I'll give you all the finger 
 I'll sell you all what for 
 The tiger in my tank 
 Is going to go extinct 
 And I'm not feeling so good myself 
 I think I'm on the brink of disasterYou think you'll get under ol' monsieur's lid 
 And try to imagine all the things that he did 
 You don't know where I'm gonna go 
 You don't know where I'll go 
 I'll go none too bravely into the night 
 I'm so tired of living the suicide life 
 That ain't no reason to live 
 Wake up in the night and think of all the years 
 Falling from the ceiling and covering your ears 
 You don't know how you're gonna get out 
 You don't know how you'll get out 
 I'll go none too bravely into the night 
 I'm so tired of living the suicide life 
 That ain't no reason to live 
 Call up your best friend and tell him a lie 
 You've got to be kidding, I'm not really high 
 I don't know where I'm gonna go 
 I don't know where I'll go 
 I'll go none too bravely into the night 
 I'm so tired of living the suicide life 
 That ain't no reason to liveSouljacker can't get my soul 
 Ate my carcass in a black man hole 
 Souljacker can't get my soul 
 He can shoot me up full of bullet holes 
 But the Souljacker can't get my soul 
 Souljacker can't get my soul 
 Left my carcass with the worms and moles 
 Souljacker can't get my soul 
 He can hang my neck from the old flagpole 
 But the Souljacker can't get my soulIn my heart there lives a little riddle 
 I’m always trying to find my way 
 Everything feels older in the morning 
 I’ll find an answer some day 
 But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But you know I’m alright 
 I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But the sun’s shining bright 
 Don’t mess with me, I’m up for a fight 
 It’s a tangled cobweb that I weave 
 The dusty room of an aching mind 
 Anything that keeps the sun rising 
 I got to see if I can find 
 But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But you know I’m alright 
 I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But the future looks bright 
 Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight 
 Riding through like an outlaw drifter 
 Never knowing which way to turn 
 In the moment I think I’ve got it 
 It’s gone 
 Pull the curtains open wide 
 Gotta know that I’m about it 
 Good God It’s another day 
 Don’t ever doubt it 
 You know I’m alright 
 I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 In my heart there lives a little riddle 
 I’m always trying to find my way 
 I don’t know what it’s going to take, man 
 I only need a little break, man 
 I know you know that I’m a good man 
 But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But you know I’m alright 
 I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But the sun’s shining bright 
 Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight

 She isn't ready for my love 
 It's all that I've got 
 But it's a pretty big thing 
 That she should recognize 
 The truth between us cannot hide 
 She knows that it's real 
 But the situation doesn't fit 
 I know what I feel 
 And I know that this is really it 
 The thing it's all about 
 And I don't have a single doubt 
 My timing is off 
 But sometimes that's how it all works 
 Believe it or not 
 We don't have a choice in matters of the heart 
 Just gotta be brave enough 
 To love and let yourself be loved 
 My timing is off 
 But I'm not worried about a thing 
 She knows that it's real 
 She couldn't throw it all away 
 For fear of happiness 
 This isn't like that other messShe locked herself in the bathroom again 
 So I am pissing in the yard 
 I have to laugh when I think how far it's gone 
 But things aren't funny any more 
 I drew a line into the dirt 
 And dared her to step right across it 
 And she did 
 So I am knocking on the door again 
 I say, "Do you want to be alone?" 
 She says, "No I don't wanna be alone 
 But I think that you do 
 I drew a line into the dirt 
 And dared her to step right across it 
 And she did 
 And I know she's right, I know how it would be 
 If I had my own way with the world 
 As I know it should be 
 She locked herself in the bathroom again 
 So I've been shutting down the lights 
 And I don't know if I'll ever go back again 
 I'm drivin' straight into the night 
 I drew a line into the dirt 
 And dared her to step right across it 
 And she didHello, this is Koool G Murder

 Never eating much, tough life for a mouse 
 And if you think you're gonna be spared 
 You're wrong 
 Field mice, head lice 
 Spiders in the kitchen 
 Don't think twice 
 'Bout whatever keeps you itchin' 
 Ice water, flyswatter 
 Gonna get you through 
 The day 
 Heat is rolling in like Hell's red rug 
 Stinking like the breath of Beelzebub 
 And if you think you won't walk on coals 
 You will 
 Field mice, head lice 
 Spiders in the kitchen 
 Don't think twice 
 'Bout whatever keeps you itchin' 
 Ice water, flyswatter

 Field mice, head lice 
 Spiders in the kitchen 
 Don't think twice 
 'Bout whatever keeps you itchin' 
 Ice water, flyswatter 
 Gonna get you through 
 The day 
 That's real goodStanding in the dark outside the house 
 Breathing the cold and sterile air 
 Well I was thinking how it must feel 
 To see that little light 
 And watch it as it disappears 
 And fades into 
 And fades into the night 
 So I know you're going pretty soon 
 Radiation sore throat got your tongue 
 Magic markers tattoo you 
 And show it where to aim 
 And strangers break their promises 
 You won't feel any 
 You won't feel any pain 
 And the streets are jammed with cars 
 Rockin' their horns 
 To race to the wire 
 Of the unfinished line 
 Thought that I'd forget all about the past 
 But it doesn't let me run too fast 
 And I just wanna stand outside 
 And know that this is right 
 And this is true 
 And I will not 
 Fade into 
 Fade into the night 
 Standing here in the darkIn the morning 
 When the birds are still asleep 
 You can feel it 
 No cars are on the street 
 It's anybody's day 
 It could go any way 
 Why wouldn't you want to make 
 The most of it? 
 In the morning 
 There's nothing left to prove 
 If it's your game 
 It's time to make a move 
 Don't look the other way 
 You're gonna have your say 
 Why wouldn't you want to make 
 It really count? 
 In the morning 
 Yesterday is just a dream 
 Out the window 
 Take a look at all you see 
 Baptized by the sun 
 Go on and have some fun 
 Why wouldn't you want to have 
 The greatest day?I need a mother 
 I'm sorry but it's true 
 I need a lover 
 Not someone like you 
 I been your daddy for too long of a time 
 Need a little mothering just once in a while 
 I need a mother 
 I'm sorry but it's true 
 It's undercover, the way it's always been 
 I should have said something 
 But I didn't know where to begin 
 You've been taking everything I have to give 
 But I don't have no more 
 This ain't no way for me to live 
 I need a mother 
 I'm sorry, that's just how it is 
 I need a mother 
 It's really nothing new 
 A little help sometimes 
 That's just what you do 
 I been your daddy for too long of a time 
 Need a little help, you know 
 Just once in a while 
 I need a mother 
 I'm sorry, but it's trueMother couldn't love me 
 But that didn't stop me 
 From liking her 
 She was my mom 
 And I was no son of a bitch 
 Daddy was a drunk 
 A most unpleasant man 
 Asleep on the floor 
 Just inside the front door 
 With a smile underneath his red nose 
 The wrong look his way 
 Well, that could really wreck his day 
 And believe me when I say 
 It would wreck your day too 
 Grandma took me in 
 Though times were pretty thin 
 Said I was no son of a bitch 
 Down on my knees 
 Begging God pleaseWas I wrong about the world? 
 It's a beautiful new place 
 Where else could a creep like me 
 Meet such a pretty face? 
 Meeting every day with the rising sun 
 Looking up it's looking like 
 My losing streak is done 
 Used to always feel like 
 Wished that I was dressed better 
 Never had a lot of luck 
 Until I finally met her 
 Feeling like the weight that weighed a ton 
 Lifted off my shoulders now 
 My losing streak is done 
 Always felt like giving in 
 To the feeling I can't win 
 But I took it on the chin 
 Now I'm finally cashing in 
 Meeting every day with the rising sun 
 Looking up it's looking like 
 My losing streak is done 
 My losing streak is done 
 I said my losing streak is done 
 Did you hear me? 
 I said my losing streak is doneEvery time I find myself in this old bind 
 Watching the death of my hopes 
 In the ring so long, gonna prove 'em wrong 
 I'm not knocked out, but I'm on the ropes 
 I've got enough fight left inside this tired heart 
 To win this one and walk out on my feet 
 No retreat 
 I may never get everything, I bet 
 But I'm a man who always copes 
 I'm hurting bad and fighting mad 
 I'm not knocked out, but I'm on the ropes 
 Everything that I hold near and dear to me 
 Is riding on this moment here and now 
 I know how 
 I've got enough fight left inside this tired heart 
 To win this one and walk out on my feet 
 No defeat 
 Gonna feel so good when it's understood 
 Behold the rebirth of my hopes 
 In the ring so long, gotta prove 'em wrong 
 I'm not knocked out, but I'm not on the ropesSad foot sign 
 Why you gotta taunt me this way? 
 The happy side is broken now 
 It's gonna be an awful day 
 And if I have to drive back by 
 To see from a different side 
 Would it be enough to say 
 The first time was a lie? 
 Sad foot sign 
 "The end is coming." 
 That's what they say 
 Maybe you could see it in 
 Your heart for one day 
 To let me feel what it's about 
 To really be alive 
 To live and breathe and see and feel 
 Then I can die 
 And when I come back to this world 
 I'll put on the uniform 
 And go into the foot sign shop 
 Where you were bornYou need help, baby, you've come unhinged 
 It's clear to everybody, you're on the fringe 
 Thought I'd stay until I died 
 But the twinkle in your eye is gone 
 And now all that's left is a mean old girl 
 Behind her crazy eyes 
 We were good together, as good as it gets 
 I only wanted to help you from the day we met 
 And I'm sleeping on the couch for months on end 
 You were more than my girl 
 You were my best friend 
 All that's left is a mean old girl 
 Behind her crazy eyes 
 I defy you to defy me 
 In your crazy state 
 You don't which way is up 
 And it's way too late 
 To ever fix all of the things 
 That you did break 
 Not least of which 
 Is my heartI know I went too far this time. 
 Got the world out, got nothing inside. 
 Painted myself in a little corner. 
 No one dares to knock at the door now. 
 Things that I, I ever heard was. 
 It'll be alright, you shoulda heard that one. 
 Have a laugh when you think about it. 
 Just try not to think about it right now. 
 This time will be the last time. 
 It's not that I don't admire your reserve. 
 It's just that, I'm not feeling so good. 
 Think about it, it'll be alright. 
 Got the world out, got nothing inside. 
 Think about me, I got nothing inside. 
 Think about me, I got nothing inside. 
 Think about me, I got nothing inside.Blue light is flickering 
 Through the city streets 
 One billion tv sets 
 Glowing off concrete 
 One day closer to death 
 I know that I don't have too long 
 Whatever happened to Soy Bomb? 
 Lunch box collector loves 
 All the pussycats 
 But when he goes to bed 
 He wonders where he's at 
 Thrift store shirts and old haircuts 
 Living in an old sitcom 
 Whatever happened to Soy Bomb? 
 The day is coming 
 When you'll have to think of it 
 Was it really worth it 
 All that shit 
 Blue light is flickering 
 Though the cloudy sky 
 One billion lonely hearts 
 Beat until they die 
 One day closer to death 
 I know that I don't have too long 
 Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?I am a lone wolf 
 I always was and will be 
 I feel fine, I am resigned to this 
 I am a lone wolf 
 I am a lone wolf 
 Got my cares 
 Wrapped up all nice and neat 
 In my suitcase 
 I'll take it down the street 
 To a place with plenty of space for me 
 I am a lone wolf 
 I am a lone wolf 
 It blows my mind 
 That people wanna try to get inside my tired head 
 I am a lone wolf 
 I am a lone wolf 
 I am a lone wolf 
 Nobody needs to get too close to me 
 You'll only see this truth 
 I am a lone wolfAah, aah, aah, aah 
 Before I sputter out 
 Aah, aah, aah, aah 
 Before I sputter out 
 Aah, aah, aah, aah 
 Before I sputter outThings were good for a, couple of minutes 
 But now it's one hard faith

 And everything will be alright 
 I'm your brave little soldier 
 Coming home to you tonight

 Ski mask yawning at my face 
 Laying on the floor, thinking how I 
 Forgot to pray last night

 Coming home to you tonight 
 Gonna be alright 
 It's money in the cup, big love's a gift

 Coming home to you tonight 
 Gonna be alright 
 Gonna be alright, alright.I wanna open my present

 Packed up tight just waiting for me 
 To rip it open and set it free 
 Relieve my state, I just can't wait 
 I wanna open my present 
 Well I'm a good boy, I behave myself 
 I've been patient and waiting so long 
 But waiting any longer, it just feels wrong 
 I know it's great, I just can't wait 
 It's right in front of me 
 I can't stop thinking about it 
 What's the harm in letting me 
 Go no longer, living without it 
 I wanna open my present 
 Well, I've been working too hard for too long 
 Sayin' my prayers and gettin' my sleep 
 Been real quiet, not making a peep 
 I know it's great, I just can't wait

 I can't stop thinking about it 
 What's the harm in letting me 
 Go no longer, living without it

 Packed up tight just waiting for me 
 To rip it open and set it free

 Exactly as I am

 In the city of cold hearts 
 It ends before it starts

 It's there, drawn in the playground 
 Love, kiss, hate or adore 
 I love Jennifer Eccles 
 And I know that she loves me 
 I love Jennifer Eccles 
 And I know she loves me 
 La la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 I used to carry her satchels 
 She used to walk by my side 
 But when we got to her doorstep 
 Her dad wouldn't let me inside 
 One Monday morning, found out I'd made the grade 
 Started me thinking that maybe she done the same? 
 I hope that Jennifer Eccles 
 Is going to follow me there 
 Our love is bound to continue 
 Love, kiss, hate or adore 
 I love Jennifer Eccles 
 I know that she loves me 
 I love Jennifer Eccles 
 And I know that she loves EAt the dark end of the street 
 That's where we'd always meet 
 Hiding in shadows where we don't belong 
 Living in darkness to hide our wrong 
 You and me, at the dark end of the street 
 You and me 
 I know that time's gonna take it's toll 
 We've got to give back all the love that we stole 
 It's a sin and we know it's wrong 
 Oh but our love keeps coming on strong 
 Steal away, to the dark end of the street 
 They're going to find us 
 They're going to find us 
 They're going to find us 
 Oh someday 
 You and me, at the dark end of the street 
 You and me 
 And if by chance we walk downtown 
 If you should see me just walk on by 
 But darling, please don't cry 
 Tonight we'll meet, at the dark end of the streetThe old oak tree had roots so far down in the ground 
 I fell from it and hit the dirt without a sound 
 I dreamt at night of growing wings so I could fly 
 A caterpillar to a moth before I die 
 I plodded through, ordinarily earthbound 
 I knew my feet could never leave the ground 
 I went about my way, unsteady and afraid 
 How could I know I was headed for this day? 
 All the seconds 
 And the minutes 
 And the hours 
 And the days 
 And the weeks 
 And the months 
 And the years of my life 
 It was all worth it 
 To be here now 
 I'm a hummingbird 
 Floatin' tree to tree 
 I'm a hummingbird 
 Beautiful and free 
 The old oak tree was dead; I had to cut it down 
 The sapling roots were new and sprouting through the ground 
 New worlds were taking shape, unseen and unknown 
 A branch to rest upon, a place to call my own 
 Something had changed and I'm not sure how or why 
 I wasn't dreaming; I was awake, I was alive 
 Gave up the ghost; he had nothing left to say 
 But it was him who brought me to this day 
 All the seconds 
 And the minutes 
 And the hours 
 And the days 
 And the weeks 
 And the months 
 And the years of my life 
 It was all worth it 
 To be here now 
 I'm a hummingbird 
 Floatin' tree to tree 
 I'm a hummingbird 
 Beautiful and freeThe kids are digging up a brand new hole 
 Where they put their deadbeat mom

 I'm alone when I know I'm a lovely guy 
 Birds come down from skies so blue 
 See all the beautiful things you do 
 Why can't I just get with you? 
 Every night I carry out my plan 
 Pray to God that one day I could be your man 
 Birds come down from skies so blue 
 See all the beautiful things you do 
 Why can't I just get with 
 You'd be my only friend in the world 
 Or you could just be my girl 
 And if I do run away from this life 
 There won't be much for me in the afterlife 
 Although I know that you don't even care 
 I'd rather stay in a world where 
 Birds come down from skies so blue 
 See all the beautiful things you do 
 Why can't I just get with you? 
 OohMy beloved monster and me 
 We go everywhere together 
 Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves 
 Gets us through all kinds of weather 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean 
 My beloved monster is tough 
 If she wants she will disrobe you 
 But if you lay her down for a kiss 
 Her little heart it could explode 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean 
 La la la la la la la la 
 La la la la la laHey Man, What? 
 Hey Man, What? 
 Hey Man, What? 
 Hey man, What? 
 Dig this 
 Well I went walkin' out yesterday 
 A man was carryin' a sign that says 
 "The world is gonna end tomorrow 
 Hey buddy, got a nickel I can borrow?" 
 This rotten world's gonna chew you up 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back out 
 The sooner you recognize this simple fact 
 Then this rotten world gives you what you lack 
 Old Miss Headtrip she's gettin' down 
 You don't see her much walkin' 'round town 
 Well you could say that she needs a little lovin' 
 Lookin' for a light with her head in the oven 
 This rotten world's gonna chew you up 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back out 
 The sooner you recognize this simple fact 
 Then this rotten world gives you what you lack, let's rock 
 Miss Kovalov she's lookin' good 
 Walkin' her ass through the neighborhood 
 She knows somethin' that you don't know 
 Somethin' she learned about a long time ago 
 This rotten world's gonna chew you up 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back out 
 The sooner you recognize this simple fact 
 Then this rotten world gives you what you lack 
 This rotten world's gonna chew you up 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back outJehovah's Witness, leave me alone 
 Jehovah's Witness, I'm not at home 
 Keep on a-knockin' and a-ringin' the bells 
 Knockin' your way straight to Hell 
 Jehovah's Witness, let's not pretend 
 That for one second you are my friend 
 Knock on my door and I'll turn out the light 
 Close the curtains and turn in for the night 
 Jehovah's Witness, why must it be 
 Just when I'm feelin' good I look out and see 
 You're walkin' up in your very nice suit 
 Walk down some alley where they'll give up a hoot 
 Jehovah's Witness, leave me alone 
 Jehovah's Witness, I'm not at home 
 Jehovah's Witness, leave me alone 
 Jehovah's Witness, I'm not at homeThe longing is a pain 
 A heavy pressure on my chest 
 It rarely leaves 
 My day becomes a quest 
 To try not to think about her 
 And all that she brings 
 Forget about her magic 
 All the beautiful things 
 Surely there are other things to life 
 But I can't think of one single thing 
 That matters more than just to see her 
 Just to see her 
 Her smile 
 Her touch 
 Her smell 
 Her laugh 
 The longing is a friend 
 A way to stay close 
 And feel like she's here 
 And feel like she knows 
 That when I say I would die for her 
 It's not just words, I really would 
 And to make the world a safer place for her 
 Well, I believe I really could 
 Surely there are other things to life 
 But I can't think of one single thing 
 That matters more than just to see her 
 To see her 
 Her tears 
 Her sorrow 
 Her faults 
 Her doubts 
 I love them allMy friend was lyin' 
 The grass was dyin' 
 It felt like a story you don't care where it leads 
 A change of venue 
 Will it mend you? 
 If the grass is not greener, you know what it needs 
 I knew that I had to throw down some seeds 
 Oh so lovely 
 Lord above me 
 I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways 
 Everybody 
 (Yeah!) 
 Oh so lovely 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am? 
 Fair-weather friends 
 They make amends 
 But you look in their eyes and you know it's not real 
 A little carin' 
 And soul-barin' 
 The actor's contract pays him how to feel 
 I knew it was time to make a new deal 
 Oh so lovely 
 Lord above me 
 I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways 
 Everybody 
 (Yeah!) 
 Oh so lovely 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am? 
 Jacaranda bloomin' 
 No clouds are loomin' 
 The trees are swayin' 
 In the wind 
 Up in the mornin' 
 Without a warnin' 
 The sun is a-shinin' like a newborn's smile 
 It's time we faced it 
 Don't wanna waste it 
 I could run away, but that's just not my style 
 And I think that I just might stay here a while 
 Oh so lovely 
 Lord above me 
 I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways 
 Everybody 
 (Yeah!) 
 Oh so lovely 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am? 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am? 
 Oh so lovely 
 Lord above me 
 I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways 
 Everybody 
 (Yeah!) 
 Oh so lovely 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am? 
 (Yeah!)I was wrong about Bobby, I admit 
 He's not the dumbest angry, young nitwit 
 No he can cut it with the best 
 And you'd better get out of his way 
 His girlfriend keeps him living in 
 A world where fear will always win 
 And if you see him out tonight 
 Well, you'd better get out of his way 
 You gotta give it up for the new modern man 
 He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can 
 Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet 
 Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet 
 If it's a dry life that you want 
 Then you'd better get out of his way 
 You gotta give it up for the new modern man 
 He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can 
 I was wrong about Bobby, don't you know 
 He's had it tough and he had to make a go 
 But if he doesn't stop fucking with me 
 Well, he'd better get out of my way 
 Yeah, he'd better get out of my way 
 He'd better get out of my wayWell the sun is shining, but it don't feel good 
 Don't smile down on this neighborhood 
 When I go walking through this stinkin' town 
 Well mister, I keep my eyes down 
 The brotherhood of the misunderstood 
 Live and die here in all likelihood 
 You're livin' in this town 
 Better pray for sundown 
 And baby when you go downtown 
 You keep your eyes down 
 You keep your eyes down 
 You keep your eyes down 
 You keep your eyes down 
 Fair-weather friends need not apply 
 The man of the house is not inside 
 Baby I'm keeping my eyes down 
 Go with the flow or ya gotta be sick 
 Think I'd rather hear my heart not tick 
 But if ya don't wanna wear a hospital gown 
 Better get out now or keep your eyes down 
 You keep your eyes down 
 You keep your eyes down 
 Fair-weather friends need not apply 
 The man of the house is not inside 
 Baby I'm keeping my eyes down 
 Well the sun is shining but it don't feel good 
 Don't smile down on this neighborhood 
 When I go walking through this stinkin' town 
 Mister I keep my eyes down 
 (The sun is shining but it don't feel good) 
 I keep my eyes down 
 (Don't smile down on this neighborhood) 
 I keep my eyes down 
 (When I go walking through this stinkin' town) 
 I keep my eyes down 
 (Mister I keep my eyes) 
 I keep my eyes downWe were on this car trip and I was looking at these rows and rows of trees all along the highway. 
 I don't know what kind of trees, apples or something. 
 There were just like thousands and thousands of rows with a thousand trees each. 
 And I picked one tree that I could see about eight trees back in this one row in the middle. 
 Just one in a billion, and that's how I felt.I like a girl with a dirty mouth 
 Someone that I can believe 
 We had a window, not open too long 
 But that time is good and gone 
 And if I ever see her again 
 Just walking by with some new guy 
 I know that we will need to pretend 
 And hope our eyes keep telling lies 
 Sit on the back porch and wonder 'bout her 
 What is she doing right now? 
 Making somebody a happier man 
 Dying her hair back to brown 
 Once in a while your life gets so good 
 Worth all the trouble of the past 
 That was the case but I think I always knew 
 Good things don't ever last 
 And if I ever see her again 
 Just walking by with some new guy 
 I know that we will need to pretend 
 And hope our eyes keep telling lies 
 I like a girl with a dirty mouth 
 Know that I can trust her 
 We had our time but it didn't last too long 
 And that time is good and gone 
 That time is good and gone 
 That time is good and goneVice President Fruitley

 La dee da doo 
 Doo dee doo dee doo doo 
 ...Get off your sled and go to bed 
 Don't you ever tire? 
 Throw a bone, I'm finally home 
 Curled up by the fire 
 Snow is falling from the sky 
 Like ashes from an urn 
 Sweet dreams, my little one 
 Now it's my turn 
 Well, Christmas is going to the dogs 
 We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs 
 And things aren't looking very good, it's true 
 So I'll just lay here and chew 
 Now, when I sleep I like to dream 
 Of rabbits in the snow 
 Jumping right into my jaws 
 From their rabbit hole 
 Take one home and set him down 
 Right next to your shoes 
 Wake up to a big surprise 
 My gift to you 
 And Christmas is going to the dogs 
 We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs 
 And things aren't looking very good, it's true 
 So I'll just lay here and chew 
 And Christmas is going to the dogs 
 We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog 
 And things aren't looking very good, it's true 
 So I'll just lay here and chew 
 So I'll just stay here and chewLaying on the bathroom floor 
 Kitty licks my cheek once more 
 And I, I could try 
 But waking up is harder when you wanna die 
 Walter's on the telephone 
 Tell him I am not at home 
 'Cause I think that I 
 Am going to a place where I am always high 
 My name's Elizabeth 
 My life is shit and pissIf you're scared to die 
 You'd better not be scared to live 
 I've been spending all my days 
 Giving all I can give 
 Last night I heard someone walk in 
 Through my bedroom door 
 What they wanted I'm not exactly sure 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 Marking time on a broken watch 
 Counting days till the old pawn shop 
 Sells me back my saxophone 
 Then everyone's gonna leave me alone 
 Two times I thought I heard someone 
 Knocking on the glass 
 I hid my head and prayed that it would pass 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 If you're scared to die 
 You better not be scared to live 
 I've been carrying round a grudge 
 Think I better forgive 
 Last night I heard footsteps walking 
 On the attic floor 
 I got up and I opened up the door 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 A friendly ghost 
 (If you're scared to die) 
 Is all I need 
 (You'd better not be scared to live) 
 A friendly ghost 
 (I've been spending all my days) 
 Is all I need 
 (Giving all I can give)I was at a funeral the day I realized 
 I wanted to spend my life with you 
 Sitting down on the steps at the old post office 
 The flag was flying at half-mast 
 And I was thinkin' 'bout how everyone is dying 
 And maybe it's time to live 
 I don't know where we're going 
 I don't know what we'll do 
 Walked into the Thriftee 
 Saw a man with the hollow eyes 
 Who didn't give me all my change 
 But it didn't bother me this time 
 'Cause I know I've only got this moment 
 And it's good 
 I went to the gas station 
 Old woman honked her horn 
 Waiting for me to fix her car 
 I don't know where we're going 
 I don't know what we'll do 
 Laying in bed tonight I'm was thinking 
 And listening to all the dogs 
 And the sirens and the shots 
 And how a careful man tries to dodge the bullets 
 While a happy man takes a walk 
 And maybe it's time to liveNew shit 
 New shit 
 New shit 
 New shit 
 Mr E be puttin it down, I'm the hottest round 
 I told y'all mother (What), y'all can't stop me now 
 Listen to me now, I'm lastin twenty rounds

 *In polish it means "This is music"It was late, had some drinks 
 It was only our second date 
 She looked good, real, real good 
 I wanted to do what I could 
 I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking 
 How deep the water may be 
 But I knew this was it, we each said to get 
 A $200 Tattoo 
 It hurt a little, hell, it hurt a lot 
 But a man who won't commit is something I'm not 
 A little tear rolled down her face 
 When it was done we went back to her place 
 I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking 
 How deep the water may be 
 But I knew she's the one, and I'm telling you, son 
 I got a $200 Tattoo, she did too 
 A $200 TattooEverett-P Boo 
 A lot of what she said and much of what she did 
 I don't doubt that she meant well while drifting and wounded 
 But it's a game she plays, a game I'd never win 
 Those days aren't coming back to change the state I'm in. 
 In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about 
 Making up reality and jealousy and doubt 
 I bow out. 
 Everything I am or what I used to be 
 Is not part of the hollow shell of a man that you see 
 All the time unsure, all my days a waste 
 Never knowing where I stood much less which way I face. 
 In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about 
 Making up reality and jealousy and doubt 
 I bow out.I can't live in a world 
 That you have left behind 
 Seen a lot, been through too much 
 But this is where I draw the line 
 It's not where you're coming from 
 It's where you're going to 
 And I just wanna go with you 
 December is a lonely month 
 In a year of lonely days 
 It's hard to tell which way is up 
 Or down or out or through the haze 
 People cheat and people lie 
 While you just watch it all go by 
 Counting days until you die 
 The stars shine in the sky tonight 
 Like a path beyond the grave 
 When you wish upon that star 
 There's two of us you need to save 
 It's not where you're coming from 
 It's where you're going to 
 And I just wanna go with you(Something's not right, I don't understand) 
 Nowadays I keep to myself 
 Everybody else can look some other way 
 Things I say seem to get me into trouble 
 That I've been through for too many days 
 And trouble is a friend of mine 
 I'd like to leave behind 
 I like my friends more refined 
 Things I lose 
 Weighing on my heart 
 Every time I start to think 
 Maybe it's through 
 A little lie 
 Goes a long way when you can't say 
 Quite for sure what's the truth 
 The truth is something no one really 
 Wants to hear you say 
 Just how you doin' and have a nice day 
 Nowadays you go for a walk 
 Better not stop and wave or say hello 
 Just this song 
 People will spit, give you shit 
 Just for looking at them 
 And for walking too slow 
 Slowly and methodically 
 I'll lock the world away 
 Haunted by my better daysYeah, she's all right 
 Just floatin' through her day 
 People throwin' words 'round 
 And talkin' such trash 
 There's so much she could say 
 That's not her way 
 That's not her way 
 I've been a fool 
 Other things on my mind 
 It's not hard to assess 
 The many terrible things she could say 
 But that's not her way 
 People, that's not her way 
 Yeah, she's all right 
 She knows who she is 
 She could stop and remind me of 
 The many ways she brightens my day 
 That's not her way 
 People, that's not her wayIt was only last June when her old man ran away 
 She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay 
 10:35 on a lonely Friday night 
 She was standin' by the bar 
 Mmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah 
 I asked her if she wanted 2 dance and she said that 
 All she wanted was a good man and wanted 2 know 
 If I thought I was qualified, yeah 
 And I said, baby don't waste your time 
 I know what's on your mind 
 I may be qualified 4 a one night stand 
 But I could never take the place of your man 
 It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 
 He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die 
 He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah 
 She couldn't stop cryin' 
 'Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay, yeah 
 She asked me if we could be friends 
 And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end 
 U know and I know 
 That we wouldn't be satisfied 
 And I said, baby don't waste your time 
 I know what's on your mind 
 U wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand 
 And I could never take the place of your man 
 The place of your manHate a lot of things, but I love a few things 
 And you are one of them 
 Hard to believe after all of these years 
 That you are one of them 
 Walk down the street, I'm thinking 
 "Everybody move along." 
 I've got a sad-hearted needing 
 To belong 
 Nevertheless, it's all the mess you made 
 But I can't let it go 
 Walk down the street, I'm thinking 
 "Look at all the ants in the farm." 
 I've got a sad-hearted feeling 
 To harm 
 Hate a lot of things, but I love a few things 
 And you are one of themSlept in all day 
 In dirty sheets 
 The stain on my shirt 
 Been there for weeks 
 When I was young I had a dream 
 I would be held in high esteem 
 I thought I'd end up a gentleman 
 Distinguished, respected, refined 
 The life that I've led 
 It's better unsaid 
 The world has no use for my kind 
 Too many years 
 Getting my way 
 Never let anyone 
 Have their say 
 How could I think it would work out? 
 Never a question, never a doubt 
 I thought I'd end up a gentleman 
 Accomplished, revered and admired 
 The life that I've led 
 I'm better off dead 
 The world has no room for my kindShe has an easy going way 
 It doesn't matter what you'd say 
 I understand just what she means 
 When she says she doesn't care 
 She doesn't let it wreck her day 
 She's a kindred spirit 
 She doesn't have an act 
 She's got a real big heart 
 And I gotta win it back 
 Hard to say how much it meant 
 The best days I've ever spent 
 She understands just what I mean 
 When I say that I don't care 
 She knows my true intent 
 She's a kindred spirit 
 With no plan of attack 
 She's got a real big heart 
 And I gotta win it back 
 Every day I live in regret and pain 
 You just don't let that get away 
 There's a kindness that she hears 
 She knows we're all so full of fear 
 She's a kindred spirit 
 When all fades to black 
 She's got a real big heart 
 And I gotta win it backThwarted again missing in the crowd 
 A friendly voice calling clear and loud 
 My big mistake, thinking that I knew 
 How to get by independent of you 
 The imatures, they have the chance 
 Quick to forget who brought 'em to the dance 
 Loyalty is paramount to me 
 It's very clear we make a winning team 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 Stay confident, doin' I'm okay 
 With anything you may do or you may say 
 We're always in quite good company 
 If I'm with you and you know you are with me 
 It's me and you, taking all now our comers 
 Watching it fall and nothing could be funner 
 The challenges only make us stronger 
 Outlast 'em all, forever maybe longer 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 Battle stations, gotta made the guns now 
 Everywhere you look and now they try to take us down 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 We gotta stick together 
 Honorable the only thing to do 
 You count on me 'cause I gotta count on you 
 I'm gonna pay up everything I owe 
 You just get ready, this is the real show 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 We gotta stick together 
 That's right, we gotta stick together, that's right 
 Let's stick togetherThey told me that I couldn't come back here again 
 Took me for some kind of fool 
 Said I was doing things that never should be done 
 But I don't care about their rules 
 As if I cared 'bout the little minds 
 In the little heads of the herd 
 There's nothing you could dream 
 Would be more absurd 
 And everybody knows 
 These are rock hard times 
 I gotta make it through 
 These are rock hard times 
 I don't know what it is they're trying to do to me 
 Make me into some sick joke 
 But no one's laughing and least of all, not me 
 It's hard to laugh as you choke 
 Hollywood lies piled up to the sky 
 Floating your way soon 
 Hope you like the rotten stench of doom 
 And everybody knows 
 These are rock hard times 
 I gotta make it through 
 These are rock hard times 
 And everybody knows 
 These are rock hard times 
 I gotta make it through 
 These are rock hard times 
 I don't know what it is they think I'm gonna try 
 They don't know what they need to fear 
 The surest sign that the end is coming soon 
 Is right there in the bathroom mirror 
 Everybody knows 
 These are rock hard times 
 I gotta make it through 
 These are rock hard times 
 These are rock hard timesDaisy 
 I never thought I'd go 
 Crazy 
 But I never thought you so 
 Until now that I see 
 All the crazy things you're doing 
 Why you wanna ruin it 
 And me? 
 Counting numbered days 
 Lately 
 I think you know it's true 
 That's it 
 It's all over, I'm through 
 For a while we can smile 
 For the people that we're passing 
 And even if they're asking 
 We can lie 
 Counting numbered days 
 Looks like the sun is gonna set 
 Know that there's nothing I regret 
 All the things that I learned 
 Well, I'd like to think I earned it 
 No need to go and burn it down now 
 Counting numbered days 
 Counting numbered days 
 Ooh, oohIf I could love you 
 I'm sure I would 
 If I could hold you 
 And feel understood 
 I'd be there now 
 But I don't know how 
 'Cause I am an animal 
 But now I'm afraid 
 Wrap me up tight 
 Keep me safe inside 
 Warm at night 
 I am no more 
 I am not good 
 I am so sorry 
 If you misunderstood 
 I'd make it up 
 But I cannot 
 If I am an animalToday is a lovely day to run 
 Start up the car with the sun 
 Packing blankets and dirty sheets 
 A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up 
 All the troubles you and I have seen 
 Cross when the drawbridge light is green 
 Don't look back to that messed-up scene 
 Packing blankets and dirty sheets 
 A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up 
 All the troubles you and I have seen 
 And all our troubles will be gone 
 Blowing out over that bridge 
 Floating up into the sky 
 Making the storm clouds cry 
 La-da-da-da-da 
 La, la-da-da-da 
 Put out that smoke and breath some air 
 Get a new name and cut your hair 
 Packing blankets and dirty sheets 
 A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up 
 All the troubles you and I have seenThis is the day 
 That I give myself up cold 
 The dust of ages 
 Settles on your days 
 And so you shake your coat off 
 And get on your way 
 Bloodshot and trembling 
 A new day has begun 
 The dust of ages 
 Settles on your days 
 And you blow it all away 
 And get on your way 
 The dust of ages 
 Settles on your days 
 But I'm not fuckin' around anymore 
 I'm on my wayI go to bed real early 
 Everybody thinks it's strange 
 I get up early in the morning 
 No matter how disappointed I was with the day before 
 It feels new 
 I don't leave the house much 
 I don't like being around people 
 Makes me nervous and weird 
 I don't like going to shows either 
 It's better for me to stay home 
 Some might think it means I hate people 
 But that's not quite right 
 I do some stupid things 
 But my heart's in the right place 
 And this I know 
 I got a dog, I take him for a walk 
 And all the people like to say hello 
 I'm used to staring down at the sidewalk cracks 
 I'm learning how to say hello 
 Without too much trouble 
 I'm turning out just like my father 
 Though I swore I never would 
 Now I can say that I have a love for him 
 I never really understood 
 What it must have been like for him 
 Living inside his head 
 I feel like he's here with me now 
 Even though he's dead 
 It's not all good and it's not all bad 
 And don't believe everything you read 
 I'm the only one who knows what it's like 
 So I thought I'd better tell you 
 Before I leave 
 So in the end I'd like to say 
 That I'm a very thankful man 
 I tried to make the most of my situations 
 And enjoy what I had 
 I knew true love and I knew passion 
 And the difference between the two 
 And I had some regrets 
 But if I had to do it all again 
 Well, it's something I'd like to doComming home from the school today 
 Crying all along the way 
 Ain't no way for a boy to be 
 Begging, 
 "Mama, shave me please." 
 You little punks think you own this town 
 But someday someone's gonna bring you down 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 You take back what you said now 
 Thats the last time I cry 
 You dont know what it is to be a friend, now 
 Till I walk beside you on the street and now 
 Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me 
 Dog faced boy 
 Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me 
 Dog faced boy 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy 
 Going back to the school tomorrow 
 Hang my heavy head in sorrow 
 Ain't no way for a boy to be 
 Ain't no way to set me free, now 
 Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me 
 Dog faced boy 
 Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me 
 Dog faced boy"I'm not having any fun. 
 I'm not having any fun. 
 Friday, five sixteen P.M." 
 And every time you crave for me, I'm here 
 And anything you hunger for, I'll share 
 And I will be quietly standing by 
 While slowly I am dying inside 
 Hold me in your arms 
 And let me be the one 
 Who can feel like I am a child 
 In love 
 Everytime I talk to you, you're down 
 ("I'm not happy") 
 And every time you need a laugh, I'm around 
 ("I wanna be happy... but I'm not happy") 
 ("Alright scumbag") 
 And when you forget I'm here, I'm not 
 It isn't really me that you forgot 
 Hold me in your arms 
 And let me be the one 
 Who can feel like I am a child 
 In love 
 Whisper now 
 And tell me how 
 You watch me and tell me 
 Somehow I'm gonna be alright 
 "I'm over this. 
 I'm over this."Baby genius 
 Look how you've grown 
 Where do you go from here? 
 Didn't we have some good times 
 After all is said and done 
 Small body and small mind 
 Big head and big headaches 
 My back is broken, baby genius 
 Find another rideMy love 
 Let me bring anything your heart desires 
 Everything you'll ever need 
 When you rise, when you retire 
 Sweet thing 
 Oh my word, such a very pretty sight 
 As a swallow in the sun 
 As a sparrow in the night 
 My love 
 Can you not feel it? 
 I don't know how to let you go on 
 A swallow in the sun 
 A sparrow in the night 
 All alone 
 Dear heart, if I may 
 You are beauty of the earth 
 You are broken like a glass 
 You don't know what you are worth 
 My love 
 Can you not feel it? 
 I don't how to let you go on 
 A swallow in the sun 
 A sparrow in the night 
 All aloneEfils good and the time is right 
 I'll bundle-up and slip away 
 The count is down and the drip is up 
 It's time to split this hunk of clay 
 Now you can bring back my suitcase but you can't bring me 
 And you can have all the money 'cause you say that you must 
 But if you think that it matters, take a look at me 
 And don't close your eyes as I turn into dust 
 Efils good 
 Don't tell me that I can't do this 
 As if you knew, but you don't know 
 How efils goodAfter the operation 
 I was in a lotta pain 
 But I look fondly on it 
 Just passin' all the days in a haze 
 Layin' on the couch and watchin' TV 
 After the operation 
 I didn't have a care 
 I'd spend whole afternoons 
 Just layin' there while I stared 
 At things in the room that made me think 
 After the operation 
 I ate a lotta junk 
 I'd drift off and fall asleep 
 And have these little dreams 
 Where I'm feeling back to my old self againWhat would you say if I left this town tomorrow? 
 I guess I would, but I know I'll miss the train 
 I know I would 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 Just laying in the sun 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 'Cause I don't care for this one 
 Chasing trains and planes and rain 
 Where is my rain falling down? 
 Upon a thirsty world 
 I never want to be the same 
 Another time, I might have fit in alright 
 But not this time, I guess I'm just too soon 
 To change my town 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 Just laying in the sun 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 'Cause I don't care for this one 
 Chasing trains and planes and rain 
 Where is my rain falling down? 
 Upon a thirsty world 
 I never want to be the same 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 Just laying in the sun 
 I'll take a dog's life 
 'Cause I don't care for this one 
 I don't care for this one 
 I don't care for this one 
 Dog's life 
 Dog's lifeYour stepmother hates my guts 
 But I don't really care 
 She don't like me coming around 
 With my short, greasy hair 
 She would be your best friend 
 If she had it her way 
 She would take all your best friends 
 And put them away 
 Your stepmother hates my guts 
 But I don't give a damn 
 She thinks I'm some kind of scum 
 'Cause I don't call her ma'am 
 La, la, la, la, la, la 
 She would be you best friend 
 If she had it her way 
 Your stepmother hates my guts 
 But I won't give up yet 
 I want you so goddamn much 
 But she sure is upset 
 Looking down again I knock on the door 
 There she is looking down on me againYou don't have a clue 
 What it is like to be next to you 
 I'm here to tell you 
 That it is good, that it is true 
 Birds singing a song, old paint is peeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 Words can't be that strong, my heart is reeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 Try, try to forget what's in the past 
 Tomorrow is here 
 Love, orange sky above, lighting your way 
 There's nothing to fear 
 Birds singing a song, old paint is peeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 Words can't be that strong, my heart is reeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 Some people are good, babe in the hood 
 So pure and so free 
 I'd make a safe bet you're gonna get 
 Whatever you need 
 Birds singing a song, old paint is peeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 Words can't be that strong, my heart is reeling 
 This is that fresh, that fresh feeling 
 That fresh feeling 
 This is that fresh feelingThe feeling of understanding 
 Is very rare 
 For someone like me it's hard 
 To find somebody to care 
 She's got a way about her 
 Changes everything 
 She's got a way about her 
 She's my sweet li'l thing 
 Sweet li'l thing 
 Making love with her indie rock 
 Playing on her stereo 
 Holding hands going down the road 
 When she drives me home 
 She's got a magic about her 
 Makes me wanna sing 
 She's got a magic about her 
 She's my sweet li'l thing 
 Sweet li'l thing 
 She's my sweet li'l thing 
 Spent the day laying in her bed 
 My nose against hers 
 Later we went for a drive 
 Didn't know where we were 
 Man I never felt so alive 
 Nobody gets the girl 
 But baby, I do 
 Nobody gets me either 
 But she sees through 
 She's got a glow around her 
 Shines on everything 
 She's got a glow around her 
 She's my sweet li'l thing 
 Sweet li'l thing 
 She's my sweet li'l thing 
 She's my sweet li'l thingAnother morning in the evening 
 Times strewn on the floor 
 And I don’t even know her name 
 Or if she lives here 
 Had enough but I want more 
 I don’t remember how I got here 
 And how long it’s been now 
 A day or two, maybe more 
 Home to home I spent the days 
 Never wandered anywhere 
 I always bit the hand that beat me 
 And they wrote me off 
 It was easy not to care 
 Never trusted anyone 
 Don’t see why I should now 
 Fade some blinking never fair 
 You’re all gonna be sorry 
 When I leave town 
 And get it together 
 For the turnaround 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the street 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the street 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the street 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the street 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the streetThere's a bright golden haze in the meadow 
 There's a bright golden haze in the meadow 
 The corn is as high as an elephant's eye 
 And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky 
 Well... 
 Oh, what a beautiful morning 
 Yes, what a wonderful day, look out there 
 I've got a beautiful feeling 
 Everything, everything's goin' my way 
 Oh, the cattle are standing like statues 
 The cattle are standing like statues 
 They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by 
 And a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye 
 She says, "Oh, what a beautiful morning" 
 Yes, what a wonderful day 
 I've got a beautiful feeling 
 I got everything, everything's goin' my way 
 Horns stand, please 
 Now perform, yeah 
 The sounds of the earth are like music 
 The sounds of the earth are like music 
 The breeze is as busy, it don't miss a tree 
 And a little ol' weepin' willow is laughin' at me 
 She says, "Oh, what a beautiful morning" 
 Yes, what a wonderful day 
 I've got a beautiful feeling 
 I got everything 
 Everything's goin' my way 
 Everything's goin' my way 
 Oh baby 
 Oh baby 
 I wanna thank you, little girl 
 For such a wonderful day 
 I've got a beautiful feeling 
 Everything's goin' my wayOne, two, three 
 Two, two, three 
 I am a man 
 In great pain over 
 Great beauty 
 It's not easy 
 Standing on my feet 
 These days 
 But you know I'm pretty sure that 
 I've been through worse 
 And I'm sure I can take the hit 
 I pushed the bed against the window today 
 So there'd only be one side 
 Well, it's a little less lonely that way 
 But I'm still dying inside 
 When I wake up 
 In the middle of the night 
 No one's gonna tell me 
 I'll be all right 
 So many thousands 
 Of days in my life 
 That I don't remember 
 And a small handful 
 Of days that I do 
 Hold near to my heart 
 And one of those days 
 That I remember well 
 Is about me and you 
 When it's time 
 To look back on my life 
 Most of it won't seem so important 
 The shit that matters 
 And what I'll really miss 
 Is falling asleep with your arms around me 
 Waking up knowing that you're there 
 Making everything feel right in the world 
 People sleeping 
 In Hazmat suits 
 Taping up their windows 
 It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world 
 And it's hard to make any sense of it 
 But one thing I know that is true in this world 
 Is the love that I felt for you 
 Being on my feet these days 
 Well, it's a wonder I survive 
 No one taught me how to live on my own 
 I'm running scared 
 One sweet day I'll be back on my feet 
 And I'll be all right 
 I just gotta get 
 Back on my feetCan't help about the shape I'm in 
 I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin 
 But don't ask me what I think of you 
 I might not give the answer that you want me to 
 Oh well 
 Now when I talk to God 
 I know he understands 
 He said "stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand" 
 But don't ask me what I think of you 
 I might not give the answer that you want me to 
 Oh wellDon't got a lot of time 
 Don't give a damn 
 Don't tell me what to do 
 I am the man 
 If there's a God up there 
 Something above 
 God, shine your light down here 
 Shine on the love 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 Don't have too many friends 
 Never felt at home 
 Always been my own man 
 Pretty much alone 
 I know how to get through 
 And when push comes to shove 
 I got something that you need 
 I got the love 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 The love of the loveless 
 All around you people walking 
 Empty hearts and voices talking 
 Looking for and finding 
 Nothing 
 Don't got a lot of time 
 Don't really care 
 Not selling anything 
 Buyer beware 
 If there's a God up there 
 Something above 
 God, shine your light down here 
 Shine on the love 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 The love of the loveless 
 Don't got a lot of time 
 Don't give a damn 
 Don't tell me what to do 
 I am the man 
 Love of the loveless 
 Love of the loveless 
 The love of the loveless 
 Love of the lovelessIt's like I'm dressed up in my mama's clothing 
 It's like I'm talking to a voice that doesn't exist 
 It's like I got a wire crossed upstairs 
 But all I want is just a little truth and that's it 
 They say I'm mental but I'm just confused 
 Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused 
 They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all 
 Another anchorman is on the TV 
 He's got that far away and vacant look in his eyes 
 I turn the channel but nothing is changing 
 The only truth is that everything is a lie 
 They say I'm mental but I'm just confused 
 Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused 
 They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all 
 There's truth in everything, there's truth in lies 
 With all this knowledge, well I think I'm gonna be wise 
 They say I'm mental but I'm just confused 
 Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused 
 They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

 Like I've always known somebody should, yeah 
 Although tomorrow don't look that good 
 Well it just goes to show 
 Though people say we're an unlikely couple 
 I'm seeing double of you 
 Oh, 
 This is life 
 When everything's all right 
 Living living living living living living living life 
 Oh, hope for the hopeless 
 I'm learning to cope, with the emotionless mediocrity o-oh 
 Of day to day living 
 How can I help but be restless when 
 Everything seems so tasteless 
 And all the colours seem to have faded away 
 Oh, 
 This is life 
 When everything's all right 
 Living living living living living living living life 
 Hold me like a mother would 
 Like I've always known somebody should, yeah 
 Although tomorrow don't look that good 
 Well it just goes to show

 Doris Day and Mott the Hoople 
 Oh, 
 This is life 
 When everything's all right 
 Living living living living living living living lifeHow does her world spin 
 without me in her nest? 
 Could there really be such happiness? 
 Oh, she's got a dark side too 
 Even murderous 
 But I love that, just like her 
 I don't have a chance at writing the book 
 I just want to be a page 
 In Jeannie's Diary 
 One single page 
 in Jeannie's diary 
 Yes, I am intense 
 Maybe quite obsessed 
 Everything she does is curious 
 Oh, she's going to let me in 
 I just know it's so 
 But then again, who do I care? 
 I don't have a prayer for writing the book 
 I just want to be a page 
 In Jeannie's diary 
 One single page 
 In Jeannie's diary, ooh 
 She could have anything she wants 
 So why not me? 
 She could have anything she dreams 
 Oh, to be 
 One single page 
 One single page 
 In Jeannie's diaryWoke up with a bang and a bug on your face 
 It crawled in your mouth and gave you a taste of 
 The good life you left behind 
 But I think you're gonna be fine 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 This nagging malaise is more than a phase 
 It feels like a job 
 But no boss ever pays you to lay there 
 And think how you'll die 
 While the tears start to well in your eyes 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 One more Saturday, all alone through the night 
 You've got to be sure when you turn out that light 
 That it's going to turn on again 
 You've got to be your good friend 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it through 
 Somebody loves you 
 And you're gonna make it throughMama had a epidural 
 Hoping I would be a girl 
 The night was black, the sky was blue 
 The darker clouds are showing noon 
 I heard screaming, the doctor shouts 
 Didn't give in, I came out 
 And here I am 
 I found my way down the street 
 Chicken hawks, filled with meat 
 The man was big, the gun was loaded 
 She had cash, but never showed it 
 I heard screamin', bleeding throat 
 And baby I got on that boat 
 And here I am 
 Now im up here in the trees 
 Shaking off the bugs and fleas 
 The days are long, the sun is beating 
 Each day I don't die is cheating 
 Send me some lovin' 
 Send me some lovin' 
 Send it now 
 Send it by giraffe or jungle telegraph 
 Or jungle telegraph 
 Or jungle telegraph 
 Or jungle telegraphEverett-Murder 
 My plan to play it cool has not been going well 
 I have such a hard time keeping the anger hidden 
 I've run it through my head a dozen times or more 
 And each time it ends with me not acting as I did. 
 A grievous oversight that I cannot erase 
 You couldn't know where to take it to 
 And none of it matters now however I appeal 
 All of it's gone, I've missed a good deal. 
 You disappointed me in ways I cannot count 
 But you were the best thing to happen to me 
 And that is no reason to forget all that you've done 
 I couldn't expect you to give credence to my plea. 
 A grievous oversight that I cannot erase 
 You couldn't know where to take it to 
 And none of it matters now however I may feel 
 All of it's gone, I've missed a good deal. 
 An effortless beauty I had not come across 
 It's a heavy loss and now it's my cross to bear forever more, I can be sure. 
 And nothing else matters now whatever I reveal 
 All of it's gone, I've missed a good deal.Ah, it's looking up 
 Let me tell you what I mean 
 Used to be kind of bitter 
 Always had a babysitter 
 But I'm feeling much fitter 
 Now I'm pretty sweet 
 Back on my feet 
 Walking down the street 
 Yeah, I'm looking up 
 It's looking up 
 I used to be cruel 
 Kind of a tool 
 Like a damn fool 
 Now I'm oh so kind 
 Got no worried mind 
 I'm a real find 
 Yeah, it's looking up 
 I'm looking up 
 I'm looking up 
 It's looking up 
 Yeah, I'm looking up 
 I never had a clue, man 
 How it was gonna go 
 But it goes to show you 
 You just never know 
 It took a little while, but I'm a real fine man now 
 Never could, but I always can now 
 Time has healed me

 I look upon you 
 Can't wait until tomorrow 
 The things that we'll do 
 And this 
 Is where 
 It gets good 
 Permission to speak freely? 
 Well, I really must confess 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 Gettin' out of your dress 
 And this 
 Is where 
 It gets good 
 The sky in your eyes 
 The earth in your touch 
 The spirits come together 
 Well, it's almost too much 
 And this 
 Is where 
 It gets goodWise men say only fools rush in 
 But I can't help falling in love with you 
 Shall I stay? Would it be a sin? 
 If I can't help falling in love with you 
 Like a river flows surely to the sea 
 Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be 
 Take my hand, take my whole life too 
 For I can't help falling in love with youAll my life I had 
 This funny little feeling 
 Came and went time and again 
 Among my daily dealings 
 Call it a deficit 
 An emptiness inside 
 Why is true love hard to find? 
 Why does true love hide? 
 But now I found you and I know that we would be 
 So very happy if you could only see 
 That I was made for you 
 And you were made for me 
 The road in front of us is long and it is wide 
 We've got beginner's luck 
 We've got it on our side 
 (woah) 
 If you are willing well I think i'm qualified 
 And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride 
 I've got a plan you know 
 I've got it all worked out 
 And all you gotta do is pack your bags 
 And check your doubts 
 You'll come around 
 And you will see just what I am 
 A true love through the worst of times 
 A true love till the end 
 So now you found me and you've only got to see 
 How complimentary we could really be 
 (woah) 
 'Cause I was made for you 
 And you were made for me 
 The road in front of us is long and it is wide 
 We've got beginner's luck 
 We've got it on our side 
 (woah) 
 We will be stronger if our forces are allied 
 And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride 
 We'll take the ride 
 As far as anyone can go 
 We'll brave it all 
 Hand in hand and toe to toe 
 I've got it all worked out 
 Don't worry about a thing 
 Just give your hand to me 
 And here, put on this ring 
 The road in front of us is long and it is wide 
 We've got beginner's luck 
 We've got it on our side 
 (woah) 
 If you are willing well I think I'm qualified 
 And with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride 
 (Woah)Loyalty is easy when you're king 
 Doesn't matter who's around to bring 
 Some friend you turned out to be 
 Looking cool but anyone can see 
 That you don't know where you're going to 
 But I have some idea 
 Count out (?) of everybody's wins 
 That's what'll finally do you in 
 Some friend you turned out to be 
 Looking cool but anyone can see 
 That you don't know where you're going to 
 But I have some idea 
 Sorry but I've got a train to catch 
 Gonna leave you and your schemes to hatch 
 Some friend you turned out to be 
 Looking cool but anyone can see 
 That you don't know where you're going to 
 But I have some ideaRemember last year when you were on your own? 
 You swore the spirit couldn't be found 
 December rolled around and you were counting on it to roll out 
 Well everybody's waiting for you down at the house 
 The tree is looking so inspired 
 There's a yuletide groove waiting for you to move 
 Come on and throw another log on the fire 
 Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
 (Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas) 
 Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
 (Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas) 
 Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
 Baby Jesus, born to rock 
 As the days go by, the more that we need friends 
 And the harder they are to find 
 If I could have a friend like you in my life 
 Then I guess I'd be doing just fine 
 And everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
 (Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas) 
 Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
 (Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas) 
 Everything's gonna be cool this ChristmasNobody listens to a whisperin' fool

 Ha, oohLet's ruin Julie's birthday 
 I didn't get my invite 
 Could be lost in the mail or something 
 I'm gonna be there tonight 
 I never cared about her anyway 
 And I guess she never cared 
 About me 
 And what do you mean that I can't go? 
 Where does it say that I'm a fool? 
 Doesn't she know that I'm an exception 
 To the rule? 
 Let's ruin Julie's birthday 
 I can see right through her act 
 She said something about me 
 And all the cool kids made a pact 
 I never cared about her anyway 
 And I guess she never cared 
 About me 
 And what do you mean that I can't go? 
 Where does it say that I'm a fool? 
 Doesn't she know that I'm an exception 
 To the rule? 
 Let's ruin Julie's birthday 
 What does she have to celebrate? 
 It's not a party if I'm not there 
 Just her stupid friends and a birthday cake 
 I never cared about her anyway 
 And I guess she never cared 
 About me 
 And what do you mean that I can't go? 
 Where does it say that I'm a fool? 
 Doesn't she know that I'm an exception 
 To the rule? 
 And what do you mean that I can't go? (What do you mean I can't go?) 
 Where does it say that I'm a fool? (You take me for a fool) 
 Doesn't she know that I'm an exception 
 To the rule?Did you think that I would laugh when you said I was small 
 Did you think that that would pass as if nothing at all 
 You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny 
 And I almost always laugh, but that's not really funny 
 You play the little bells and tell a good story 
 You bake delicious pie and that's enough for me 
 But I am big and I'm your man and you're my little honey 
 And I like what you have to say, but that's not really funny 
 You must not continue to emasculate me 
 The neighbor children through the window clearly see 
 The little boy will wipe his nose because it's runny 
 Then point at me and laugh, but that's not really funnyKnow is ...hope 
 And if you're dirty and you need a shower 
 You'd better be clean for a happy hour 
 The kid out of the river jack 
 And dry yourself on the dark 
 You're a busy man with things to do 
 And we're gonna show you how to rock 
 Like this 
 We're gonna rock... like this 
 We're gonna rock... this is itWoke up lost 
 In a world I didn't know 
 I shook it off and 
 I'm trying to make a go 
 Ever get the feeling that the story isn't done? 
 And you know that you are not the only one? 
 And I know you're out there somewhere 
 And I know that you are well 
 Looking for an answer 
 But only time can tell 
 Parallels 
 All things being equal 
 I'd rather not forget 
 The things I've seen 
 And the people that I've met 
 But something down inside me makes me think there's something more 
 And I don't have any proof, but I'm sure 
 And I know you're out there somewhere 
 And I know that you are well 
 Looking for an answer 
 But only time can tell 
 Parallels 
 Mmm, mmm 
 Mmm, mmm 
 Woke up lost 
 In a world I can't escape 
 What I'll become 
 Is slowly taking shape 
 Start again is not the end but altogether new 
 And I'm never giving up till I find you 
 And I know you're out there somewhere 
 And I know that you are well 
 Looking for an answer 
 But only time can tell 
 Parallels 
 ParallelsHow can you tell me how much you miss me 
 When the last time I saw you, you wouldn't even kiss me 
 That rich guy you've been seein' must have put you down 
 So welcome back, baby, to the poor side of town 
 To him you were nothin' but a play-thing 
 Not much more than an overnight fling 
 To me you were the greatest this boy had ever found 
 And god it's hard to find nice things on the poor side of town 
 I can't blame you for trying 
 I'm trying to make it too 
 I got one little hang up, baby 
 I just can't make it without you 
 So tell me, are you gonna stay now? 
 Would you stand by me, girl, all the way now? 
 With you by my side, they can't keep us down 
 Together we can make it baby, from the poor side of town 
 Together we can make it baby, from the poor side of townWhen I was born 
 The doctor said 
 There's something wrong 
 Inside that baby head 
 When I was a boy 
 In Sunday school 
 I told them all 
 That they were fools 
 All in a day's work 
 To live and breathe 
 A sight to see 
 And so it goes 
 I went into 
 The fortune teller's 
 She wouldn't read 
 My horoscope 
 I go into 
 The laundromat 
 The people all 
 Buy extra soap 
 All in a day's work 
 To live and breathe 
 A sight to see 
 All in a day's work 
 To live and breathe 
 A sight to seeAgatha was beautiful 
 Her long black hair and aching eyes 
 Even when she didn't feel so good, she looked alright 
 She always had a smile 
 And it was good for a while 
 I wouldn't answer each time the phone rang 
 But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang 
 Agatha, she wasn't mean 
 She didn't cheat, she never lied 
 Even if she disagreed with you, it wasn't a fight 
 Made you feel like you're both right 
 But then I lost sight 
 I couldn't bear to break up my old gang 
 But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang 
 What was so important then? 
 I haven't a clue 
 How could I have been so blind and cruel? 
 Agatha, where did you go? 
 Do I have the slightest chance 
 I could make up for everything that I did wrong? 
 But I know it's just a song 
 And you're probably long gone 
 Forgot all about her 
 Each night that I sang 
 But I should have stayed with Agatha ChangI'm gonna tell you 
 What you need to hear 
 And I'm a little too late 
 By three or four years 
 And it may not make much sense 
 Now that we are apart 
 But I'm going to stop pretending 
 That I didn't break your heart 
 You see I never thought enough of myself 
 To realize 
 That losing me could mean something 
 Like the tears in your eyes 
 And I want to tell you I'm sorry 
 And it's too late to start 
 But I'm going to stop pretending 
 That I didn't break your heart 
 And it's Christmas Eve 
 Years down the line 
 Sitting here wishing I'd treated you better 
 When you were mine 
 And I have no way of knowing 
 Where you are 
 But I'm going to stop pretending 
 That I didn't break your heart 
 I didn't mean to hurt you 
 I didn't know what I was doing 
 But I know what I have doneMiss O'Malley didn't mean what she said 
 Got a heart but a head full of lead 
 She can dream but she never can do it 
 You're alright and you're gonna get through it 
 People spend their days 
 Trying to find new ways 
 To put you down all over town 
 But they're not fit 
 To lick your boots 
 Nothing harder to watch 
 Than an Englishman trying to cry 
 Even if he can 
 He can dream but he never can do it 
 Saying you, you're the one that blew it 
 People spend their days 
 Trying to find new ways 
 To put you down all over town 
 But they're not fit 
 To lick your boots 
 People spend their days 
 Trying to find new ways 
 To put you down all over town 
 But they're not fit 
 To lick your boots[Ladies and gentleman I give you Butch] 
 Thank you 
 Well there is something I wanted to touch upon this evening 
 I don't remember if I had spoken about it here or... 
 in other parts of this wonderful land you call 
 the Isle of whatever the hell you call it 
 Everybody has got a different name 
 It is pretty..., whatever 
 Anyway 
 Whatever dude, okay, here 
 The problem is, and what I wanted to bring up is 
 A little thing I like to call Hot and Cold 
 Listen 
 [sound of hot] 
 That is the sound of Hot 
 ssshhhhhttttt. 
 [sound of cold] 
 That is the sound of Cold 
 Listen again 
 [sound of hot] 
 Hot 
 [sound of cold] 
 Cold 
 In America we have a thing cold two faucets and one spigot 
 Over here, wherever we go, like backstage right now 
 There is a faucet for the fucking hot water and one for the cold water 
 And I can't mix them together 
 I BURN my hand, and then I FREEZE  my hand 
 And then I BURN my hand and I FREEZE my hand 
 No, no, no, no, … no clapping 
 It's your problem, not mine 
 I'm just wondering, anybody else having the same problem 
 I'm just checking 
 Hot, hot, hot, … BURN 
 Cold, cold, cold, …FREEZING 
 Hot, hot, hot 
 Cold, cold, cold, cold 
 I WANT BOTH, I want both 
 In one spigot, hot and cold making warm, warm 
 Ah, feel the warm water 
 It's not BURNING 
 It's not FREEZING COLD 
 It's in the middle, it's warm, warm 
 I can't wait to get back out to my warm water 
 I just wanted to share that 
 Thank you very muchI've got something 
 Maybe I should tell you 
 I may check out 
 At any given time 
 Things won't get better 
 Until they get much worse 
 Is the curse stronger than me 
 Or am I stronger than the curse 
 Everyone is scared of me 
 And I'm scared of me too 
 Never know just what I'm gonna do 
 Heads up, kittens 
 Everything is bad 
 The sky is dark now 
 But it's the best dark I ever had 
 Hang on to a little thing 
 And let it guide the way 
 Bring it with you to 
 Another day 
 I've got something 
 Maybe I should tell you 
 I'm hanging on here 
 And I'm really gonna try 
 Things won't get better 
 Until they get much worse 
 Am I stronger than the curse?In the evening when the sun goes black 
 I sit alone and I plan my stunning comeback 
 I got your worst and you got my best 
 I passed the test 
 I got a lot from your endless mess 
 Thanks I guess 
 I sleep well knowing everything I earned 
 My companion: the lesson that I learned 
 I got your worst and you got my best 
 I passed the test 
 I got a lot from your endless mess 
 Thanks I guess 
 The yellow sky; the blue around the clouds 
 To still be standing makes a man feel proud 
 I got your worst and you got my best 
 I passed the test 
 I got a lot from your endless mess 
 Thanks I guessI can't look at the rocket launch 
 The trophy wives of the astronauts 
 And I won't listen to their words 
 'Cause I like 
 Birds 
 I don't care for walkin' downtown 
 Crazy auto car gonna mow me down 
 Look at all the people like cows in a herd 
 Well I like 
 Birds 
 If you're small and on a search 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch on 
 I can't stand in line at the store 
 The mean little people are such a bore 
 But it's all right if you act like a turd 
 'Cause I like 
 Birds 
 If you're small and on a search 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch on 
 If you're small and on a search 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch on 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch on 
 If you're small and on a search 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch on 
 I've got a feeder for you to perch onSo you've got balls now 
 Murray on the run 
 Down on Newberry Street 
 Seventeen seconds of fun 
 Apes are overrated blocky 
 A kinky batch of pudding, yay 
 Garbage dump, pumpkin rot 
 And candy apple gray 
 Werewolf in the flowerbed 
 Perfect day for lucky guy 
 This song was never meant to be released 
 What's that flaming ball in the sky? 
 The crackhead from Texas 
 He can read my feet 
 A bruised piñata 
 And a liquid pixie 
 If friends were flowers 
 Nothing gold can stay 
 Gun-sexual sense 
 And squeegee tails 
 Bees in the cookie jar 
 Symphonic despair 
 Reinventing the manifesto 
 Are you? We don't care 
 Jacuzzis and bunnies 
 A broken fondue set 
 Koool G is in the outhouse 
 You can be my Mr. French 
 This old Frisbee 
 Is shitting in the alley 
 I saw a naked picture of me on the internet 
 Wearing Jesus' new snowshoes 
 Golly gee 
 If Hell is crowded, then we shall sing 
 A hip song for the kids in the back 
 For Michelle and the dripping of a faucet 
 Ride the vicious bicycle on the tracks 
 Olympic mayonnaise, Doctor Thunder 
 Low occupancy vehicle stops and starts 
 With Hollywood suspicion 
 The doctor has snake hearts"These are the sounds of the days that are past." 
 "A miracle was about to happen."It's a beautiful morning 
 The sky is black as ink 
 The city's sleeping still 
 And soon they'll wake up to the stink 
 And soon they'll wake up 
 To the stink of life passing them by 
 Wake up and smell the stink of their lives 
 The garbage trucks are coming 
 To take your shit to the dump 
 You're smelling pretty now 
 Such a pretty little lump 
 A pretty little lump of flesh 
 Who's lost your way 
 Another night, another day 
 And when you sleep at night 
 Dreaming of the pretty things 
 Don't be too surprised 
 When the telephone rings 
 Wooh, wooh 
 Wooh, wooh 
 Wooh, wooh 
 I'll be sitting here 
 Waiting for the other shoe to drop 
 I'll be sitting here 
 Waiting for the other shoe to dropStrollin' down a green pathway 
 With my fellow invalids 
 Halloween party tonight 
 In the women's gym 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 I'd ask you if I dance, ooh? 
 Men's ward wants me back 
 By 10, not far? 
 Take down your half mask 
 And I'll see who you are 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 I'd ask you if I dance, ooh? 
 At three o'clock this morning 
 Look through the glass 
 I'll blink the floor lights on and off 
 Like ships that pass 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 I'd ask you if i... 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 I'd ask you if i... 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 I'd ask you if I dance, ooh? 
 OohTen pounds and a head of hair 
 Came into without a care 
 What they thought were cries were little laughs 
 Only looking forward and moving fast 
 The little bundle had arrived 
 And I was happy to be alive 
 In a magic world 
 Long days and dreaming nights 
 Wide eyes take in all the sights 
 A little wonder goes a long, long way 
 Learning where to go and what to say 
 Say hello to your new son 
 Well he sure is having fun 
 In a magic world 
 Every moment's built to last 
 When you're living without a past 
 In a magic worldWent down by the old courthouse 
 Stumbling through the streets 
 Had to get out of the house 
 Had to use my feet 
 And you may not think much of me now 
 But I think so damn much 
 Of you 
 Don't take any wooden nickels 
 When you sell your soul 
 A devil of a time awaits you 
 When the party is over, you're on your own 
 Trash truck coming up the road 
 Picking up the trash 
 Riding to a better place 
 Hoping we don't crash 
 Thinking of things after now 
 I never would have guessed it 
 This way 
 Don't take any wooden nickels 
 When you sell your soul 
 A devil of a time awaits you 
 When the party is over, you're on your own 
 And you may not think much of me now 
 But I think so damn much 
 Of you 
 Don't take any wooden nickels 
 When you sell your soul 
 A devil of a time awaits you 
 Now the party is over, I'm on my own 
 La la la la la la la 
 la la la laShe used to love me but it's 
 Over now 
 That was a good thing that's 
 Gone man, gone 
 I pass the hours 
 Just to get by 
 Talk to the dogs 
 So I know that I'm alive 
 I never thought that I should quit 
 All the stupid crazy shit that I do 
 In the name of 
 Keepin' good things away 
 Some things you can 
 Puck right up 
 Other things 
 Well, you better not screw up 
 My problem was 
 That I could not see 
 What was important 
 Right in front of me 
 I never though that I should quit 
 All the stupid crazy shit that I do 
 In the name of 
 Keepin' good things away 
 How much longer, man 
 Before they surf? 
 It's here today 
 But it's gone man, gone 
 The epitaph scratched upon my stone: 
 "Here lies a man who just wanna be alone" 
 She used to love me but it's 
 Over now 
 That was a good thing that's 
 Gone man, goneThe smokestack spotting black soot into the sooty sky 
 The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye 
 The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage 
 The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 The girl with the cruls 
 And the sweet pink ribbon in her hair 
 She's crawling out her window 
 'Cause her daddy, he just don't care, come on 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 The clown with the frown 
 Driving down to the sidewalk fair 
 Finger on the trigger 
 Let me tell you gave us quite a scare 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 The kids flip their lids 
 When their lids hear that crazy sound 
 My neighbor digs the flavor 
 Still he's moving to another town 
 And I don't believe he'll come back 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Well, I don't know 
 How you take in all the shit you see 
 No don't believe anyone 
 And most of all don't believe me, believe you 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful day 
 Goddamn right it's a beautiful dayTaking a walk down to the mall 
 Smellin' piss and beer and gas 
 That could be me in a couple years 
 Suckin' fumes under the highway pass 
 On a rainy day 
 While I wear newspapers for pants 
 And a T-shirt that says 
 "Damn, I'm Good." 
 People look funny when they cry 
 'Cause they just can't let it hide 
 Tapping into your little box 
 Press the cry button, it unlocks 
 On a rainy day 
 No one has a thing to say 
 Easier to look the other way 
 Take a look in the killer's eyes 
 And you see there's nothing there 
 But something is sacred in your eyes 
 And somethin' to believe 
 On a rainy day 
 And as the world will blow to bits 
 I'll cradle you and hold you tightHey 
 Hey 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 It's the dance the kids all feel 
 Just get down under your desk 
 Feels like your mama's nest, alright 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 It's the one thats really real 
 You're gonna love it if you give it a try 
 You just lay down like you're gonna die, alright 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 If you feel like your fate is sealed 
 Then just get down and curl on up 
 Just like a little helpless pup, alright 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 (Hey) 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 (Hey) 
 Everyone is going fetal

 Everyone is going fetal

 Going fetal

 Going fetal 
 (hey)Lilac blowing through the warm summer air 
 Hint of your perfume, the smell of your hair 
 Sun is setting and the crows all cry 
 Electrical storm forming in the sky 
 Got a hurt inside that I just gotta heal 
 All I can do is feel, feel, feel 
 Day is dying and the night is born 
 Baby, don't leave me so lovelorn 
 A hungry dog howls through the trees 
 It echoes long on the lilac breeze 
 A blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Birds do it, bees do it, I wanna do it 
 The only thing we need to do is get down to it 
 Please hear my plea, know it comes from the heart 
 Baby, you and me got something to start 
 A hungry dog howls through the trees 
 It echoes long on the lilac breeze 
 A blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Why won't you hear me? 
 I'm a desperate man 
 Darlin' don't fear me 
 Just say we can 
 Lilac blowing in the warm summer breeze 
 Floatin' so soft with the cries in the trees 
 Sun is settin' and the day is dead 
 How can I get it through your pretty little head? 
 A hungry dog howls through the trees 
 It echoes long on the lilac breeze 
 The blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 A hungry dog howls through the trees 
 It echoes long on the lilac breeze 
 A blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it bad 
 Girl, I want it badI put a spell on you 
 Because you're mine 
 Stop the things you do 
 Watch out, I ain't lying 
 I can't stand 
 No running around 
 I can't stand 
 And no putting me down 
 I put a spell on you 
 Because you're mine 
 Stop the things you do 
 Watch out, I ain't lying 
 I love you, I love you 
 I love you anyhow 
 I don't care if you don't want me 
 I'm yours right now 
 I put a spell on you 
 Because you're mine, mine, mine 
 Oh you're mineLife goes on 
 Nothing is new 
 Judge made it clear 
 I can't be near you 
 Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man 
 Just someone who knows he's in love 
 I made mistakes 
 Everyone does 
 Don't know why I did 
 I guess just because 
 No one gets through to me the way that you do 
 Now I know I'm in love 
 Baby, it's a little much 
 To never touch you 
 When I know I'll never 
 Find another love like this 
 Life goes on 
 Nothing is new 
 Passing the days 
 Thinking 'bout you 
 Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man 
 Just someone who knows he's in loveLet's go down to the fashion show 
 With all the pretty people that you don't know 
 We'll sit down in the velvet chairs 
 They'll hand awards out for Best Hair 
 And if we don't win one, well, then 
 We'll blow off our heads in despair 
 We'll blow off our heads in despair 
 I smell magic in the room 
 Flashing lights and sonic booms 
 Lovely saps all without a care 
 Nobody said that the world was fair 
 And if they did say so, well, then 
 We'll blow off our heads in despair 
 We'll blow off our heads in despair 
 Let's go down to the fashion show 
 With all the pretty people and piles of blow 
 We'll sit down in the velvet chairs 
 And hang on tight to our bus fare 
 And if it falls between the seats 
 We'll blow off our heads in despair 
 We'll blow off our heads in despairIt's a motherfucker 
 Being here without you 
 Thinking 'bout the good times 
 Thinking 'bout the bad 
 And I won't ever be the same 
 It's a motherfucker 
 Getting through a Sunday 
 Talking to the walls 
 Just me again 
 But I won't ever be the same 
 I won't ever be the same 
 It's a motherfucker 
 How much I understand 
 The feeling that you need someone 
 To take you by the hand 
 And you won't ever be the same 
 You won't ever be the sameTake heart, my little friend 
 And push back your seat 
 Soon we'll be far away 
 Far from the street 
 Where you learned how to be 
 Not what you are 
 Up on the shoulder 
 There is a town 
 With a little motel 
 And an old movie house 
 We'll go to a movie 
 Whatever it is 
 Watchin' the movie 
 The world's gonna end 
 And there ain't no place for 
 A boy and his friend 
 To go 
 I'll pick some daisies 
 From the flower bed 
 Of the Galaxy Theater 
 While you clear your head 
 I thought some daisies 
 Might cheer you up 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 OoooooooooooooEverything is good these days but 
 All of my friends are dying 
 Davy may and Lisa may but 
 Nobody else really wants to stay 
 Nobody else really wants to stay 
 I said now open the door 
 Open the door I can't stay here anymore 
 Open the door 
 Open the door 
 Candle light the streets at night 
 Thinking you're wrong but you know you're right 
 Thinking you're wrong but you know you're right 
 I said now open the door 
 Open the door I can't stay here anymore 
 Open the door 
 Open the door 
 Everything is good these days but 
 All of my friends are dying 
 Careful when you say goodbye 
 Careful stays and careless dies 
 But careless is and careful tries 
 I said now open the door 
 Open the door I can't stay here anymore 
 Open the door 
 Open the doorOoh, uh 
 I am el hombre lobo 
 On the prowl for a restless night 
 I got her right here in my sights 
 Got a fuse that I can light 
 She's tremendous 
 She's dynamite 
 She is a formidable opponent 
 She could put up a hard won fight 
 Got her head screwed on real tight 
 Being the bomb is her birthright 
 She's tremendous 
 She's dynamite 
 She's tremendous dynamite 
 I am el hombre lobo 
 On the prowl just past midnight 
 Darting under the town searchlights 
 It's all worth it to take a bite 
 She's tremendous 
 She's dynamiteMy beloved monster and me 
 We go everywhere together 
 Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves 
 Gets us through all nasty weather 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from living in a world 
 That's so damn mean 
 My beloved monster is tough 
 If she wants she will disrouge you 
 But if you lay her down for a kiss 
 Her little heart it could explode 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from living in a world 
 That's so damn mean 
 Lalalalalalalalalalalala lalalalalalaThe cut-rate mime walking through the dirty streets 
 Of Paris in the hot August heat 
 Sun melting the fake smile away 
 Just looking for a place to stay 
 The actress gave up all her old dreams 
 And traded up, now she is a queen 
 Royal familys don't have time for that shit 
 Your crystal ball, you keep it hid 
 The tractor-trailor driver radios: 
 "Help me someone, I'm out here all alone." 
 Truck driving the black night away 
 Praying for the light of day 
 The kid in the mall works at Hawt Dawg on a Stick 
 His hat is a funny shape, his heart is a brick 
 Taking your order, he will look away 
 He doesn't have a thing to say 
 But me, I'm feeling pretty good as of now 
 I'm not so sure when I got here or how 
 Sun melting the fake smile away 
 I think you know, I'll be okayOoh 
 Ooh 
 Like a dying man who you tell 
 "You will be alright," 
 that is the sell 
 When you know full well it isn't true 
 That's what's happened between me and you 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 I know how you don't want to see 
 That bored look on my face but you see 
 I don't think you know how to change it 
 Inching towards the end bit by bit 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 It's worth noting that it could be saved 
 If not for the recent events 
 A series of misunderstandings 
 Set the course for a crash landing 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 If I could do just one thing 
 Set the clock back many years ago 
 I'd teach that motherfucker that raised you 
 How to treat you right 
 Ooh 
 OohYou're my friend, you've done a lot of really nice things for me 
 And I won't forget 'em, do you know how much you mean to me 
 You're my friend and no matter what I'm doing you were there for me 
 Without you my ship will surely drift out lost at sea 
 Just when I think I've ended you too much 
 You always find a way to come through in the clutch 
 And you don't make me feel I owe you, but I do 
 You're my friend from the day we met till the bitter end 
 I don't know how I could have made it any other way 
 Yeah, you're my friend, coming through again and again 
 Your good will, I never will betray 
 Sweet charity, all the nice things that you do for me 
 I can't forget 'em, do you know how much that means to me? 
 Sweet charity, no matter how I screw up you were there for me 
 Without you I can't say how dark the days would be 
 Just when I think I've handed you too much 
 You always find a way to come through in the clutch 
 And you don't make me feel I owe you, but I do 
 You're my friend from the day we met till the bitter end 
 I don't know how I could have made it any other way 
 Yeah, you're my friend, coming through again and again 
 Your good will, I never will betray 
 Just when I think I've handed you too much 
 You always find a way to come through in the clutch 
 And you don't make me feel I owe you, but I do 
 You're my friend from the day we met till the bitter end 
 I don't know how I could have made it any other way 
 Yeah, you're my friend, coming through again and again 
 Your good will, I never will betray 
 You're my friendSun comes up on the old neighbourhood 
 Spray painted bricks and dead firewood 
 Well, I don't know where I'm gonna be next 
 I don't care where I'm gonna be 
 Next time, if you think of it 
 You might remember me as 
 The one who let you down 
 But never made another sound of fear 
 Some people like to call me Chuck 
 It's "Charles" and you are shit outta luck 
 If you think you know what happens next 
 You think you know what happens 
 Next time, if you think of it 
 You might remember me as 
 The one who let you down 
 But never made another sound of fear 
 Sun goes down on the old neighborhood 
 Dark damp has stopped where I once stood 
 I don't know where the bus stops next 
 And I don't care where the bus stops 
 Next time, if you think of it 
 You might remember me as 
 The one who let you down 
 But never made another sound of fear 
 The sound of fear 
 I can hear 
 The sound of fearThere's a spider crawling 
 On the bathroom mirror 
 Right on top of my right eye 
 And I can't stop staring back 
 How did I get this way? 
 Take a big look at a living lie 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 How do you stand when you've been crushed? 
 So rags to riches was a bust 
 Sometimes I dream about it 
 What it's like back home 
 The railroad tracks and the pussy willow 
 But I had to leave it 
 And I go back 
 Whenever my tired head hits the pillow 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 How do you stand when you've been crushed 
 So rags to riches was a bust 
 Busted once again 
 But I'll show them one day 
 That I can buy and sell the world 
 And one day I'll come through 
 My American dream 
 But it won't mean a fuckin' thing 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 How do you stand when you've been crushed? 
 So rags to rags and rust to rust 
 Don't let me go 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 Don't let me go 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 Don't let me goWhat can I tell you you haven't heard a hundred times 
 About the man who didn't know he'd lost his mind? 
 He didn't know he'd lost his mind 
 He really thought that he was fine 
 Mary and Joseph look away from what is here 
 It's not gonna be a pretty sight 
 Sight 
 If it could be a little more and a little less 
 Maybe I'd get it all together and get out of this mess 
 I'm gonna get out of this mess 
 And I'll do my very best 
 To get out of this mess 
 And I'll go where I can breatheShe had the eyes of someone older 
 I have the eyes that wander 'round 
 I couldn't see what really mattered 
 Caught hell from my boss 
 Don't care about my job 
 Caught a cold from the rain 
 Don't care if I'm cold 
 Played every record that I own today 
 But the only thing I care about got away 
 The only thing I care about got away 
 She was a walking work of art 
 I am a broken wind-up toy 
 I thought I knew what really mattered 
 Got a flat on the road 
 Don't care about my car 
 Lost twenty-six bucks 
 Don't care about my rent 
 Caught every episode on tv today 
 But the only thing I care about got away 
 The only thing I care about got away 
 She had a brilliant future 
 I have a past 
 I have my memories 
 But they're fading fast 
 Caught hell from my boss 
 Don't care about my job 
 Caught a cold from the rain 
 Don't care if I'm cold 
 Played every record that I own today 
 But the only thing I care about got away 
 The only thing I care about got away 
 (The only thing I care about got away) 
 The only thing I care about got awayTurn the ugly light off, God 
 Wanna feel the night 
 Every day it shines down on me 
 Don't you think that I see 
 Don't you think that I see 
 What it's all about 
 Hard to look the other way 
 While the world passes me by 
 And everyone is trying to bum me out 
 It's a pretty big world, God 
 And I am awful small 
 Every day they rain down on me 
 Flower in a hailstorm 
 Flower in a hailstorm 
 I'm livin' for the drought 
 I could throw it back at them 
 But then I'd play their game 
 Everyone is trying to bum me out 
 When I came into this world they slapped me 
 And every day since then I'm slapped again 
 Tomorrow's king, an unsightly coward 
 You see, I know I'm gonna win 
 Turn the ugly light off, God 
 Don't wanna see my face 
 Every day it will betray me 
 Don't you think that I know 
 Don't you think that I know 
 What they're talking about 
 If they step on me tonight 
 They're gonna pay someday 
 Everyone is trying to bum me out 
 Mmm 
 MmmWhere do you go when 
 The day is done 
 But you are not? 
 You look for a friend, but 
 Maybe I'm 
 All you got 
 Hard to pretend that I've always been here 
 Ready to be your man 
 And I heard sounds 
 Comin' through 
 The bedroom wall 
 Somebody cryin' 
 Echoin' 
 Down the hall 
 Never knew what it is to be a man 
 But now I know that I can 
 It's all here for you 
 It's all here for you 
 And when you need me 
 You know that I'm 
 Always here 
 It's not gonna be like 
 It ever was 
 Before, my dear 
 Hard to believe the dyin' words of a lyin' man 
 But that's not me 
 Here I am 
 It's all here for you 
 It's all here for youIn the waning days ahead 
 I gotta look back down the road 
 I know that it's not too late 
 All the stupid things I've said 
 And people I've hurt and let down 
 I hope that it's not my fate 
 To keep defeating my own self 
 And keep repeating yesterday 
 I can't keep defeating myself 
 I can't keep repeating the mistakes of my youth 
 In the dark of night, I might 
 Be able to make myself think 
 That I'm still a younger man 
 But when the light of day shines down 
 There's no way to get around it 
 I'm not the younger man 
 I keep defeating my own self 
 And keep repeating yesterday 
 I can't keep defeating myself 
 I can't keep repeating the mistakes of my youth 
 The choice is mine for making 
 A better road ahead 
 The road that I've been taking 
 Headed for a dead-end 
 But it's not too late to turn around 
 In the final moments 
 I hope that I know that I tried 
 To do best I could 
 Stop defeating my own self 
 And stop repeating yesterday 
 I can't keep defeating myself 
 I can't keep repeating the mistakes of my youthGoin' over to Susan's house 
 Walking south down Baxter Street 
 Nothin hidin' behind this picket fence 
 There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk 
 Where her house burnt down two years ago 
 People say back then she really wasn't that crazy 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 I can't be alone tonight 
 Down by the Donut Prince a 15 year old boy 
 Lies on the sidewalk with a bullet in his forehead 
 In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes 
 For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag 
 Meanwhile an old couple argues inside the Queen Bee 
 The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 She's gonna make it right 
 Take a left down Echo Park 
 A kid asked do I want some crack 
 TV sets are spewing 
 Baywatch 
 Through the windows into black 
 Here comes a girl with long brown hair 
 Who cant be more than 17 
 She sucks on a red popsicle 
 While she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage 
 And I'm thinking, 
 "That must be her sister. 
 That must be her sister right? 
 " 
 They go into the 7-Eleven 
 And I keep walking 
 And I keep walking 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 Goin' over to Susan's house 
 I can't be alone to night 
 Goin' over to Susan's houseWake up the dying, don't wake up the dead 
 Change what you're saying, don't change what you said 
 Now that it's time I got out of bed 
 And I walk myself down Sycamore Street 
 The sun beats down, no shoes on my feet 
 And I stumble on a daisy through concrete 
 Pink and brown babies in pink stroller cars 
 They know that it's good they don't care where they are 
 They know that home doesn't feel very far 
 And I walk myself down Sycamore Street 
 The sun beats down, no shoes on my feet 
 And I stumble on a daisy through concrete 
 Here we go 
 Oh yeah 
 That's how I like it 
 Airplane is flying up in the sky 
 Making a pattern with the white lines 
 Looks like a heart or maybe a pie 
 And I walk myself down Sycamore Street 
 The sun beats down, no shoes on my feet 
 And I stumble on a daisy through concrete 
 A daisy through concrete22 miles of hard road 
 33 years of tough luck 
 44 skulls buried in the ground 
 Crawling down through the muck, oh yeah

 Johnny don't like the school 
 One day Johnny gonna do somethin' 
 Show 'em he's nobody's fool, oh yeah 
 Sisters, brothers make better lovers 
 Family affairs now under the covers 
 Trailer park of broken hearts 
 Won't let you leave until you're bleeding 
 Sally don't like her daddy 
 Sally don't like her friends 
 Sally and Johnny watchin' TV 
 Waitin' for it to end, oh yeah, wooh 
 Sisters, brothers make better lovers 
 Family affairs now under the covers

 Ha Ha Ha Ha Wha Ha Ha Ha Ha... Woo! 
 22 miles of hard road 
 33 years of tough luck 
 44 skulls buried in the ground 
 Crawling down through the muck, oh yeahLook at that picture on the wall 
 And what do you see? 
 The eyes of a goat in a cowboy suit 
 Lookin' like me 
 The attic is smoldering 
 The hallways bleed 
 And the basement is full of useless trinkets 
 That I don't need 
 I need you to know I'm not insane 
 I know where I go I'm not afraid 
 To leave behind a place like this 
 So if you need to look away 
 If you feel a little sick 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 I'll show you a trick 
 The porch is a rusty cage 
 The garden's a weed 
 And the basement is full of useless trinkets 
 That I don't need 
 I need you to know I'm not insane 
 I know where I go I'm not afraid 
 To leave behind a place like thisThe sum of all your experiences 
 A living breathing result of the fight 
 And every night you spent shrouded in darkness 
 Has led you to this moment in the light, it's alright 
 Wonderful 
 Glorious 
 Wonderful 
 Glorious 
 Ahh ahh ahh ah, ah ah... 
 Wonderful 
 Glorious 
 The sum of all the love inside your heart 
 Will get you through your plight, it's alright 
 Wonderful 
 Glorious 
 My love is beautiful, it's here for the taking 
 It's strong and pure and utterly earth shaking 
 My love has brought me here to show you it's true 
 A wretch like me, you'll make it throughCan't say I know what will happen tomorrow 
 I can't say I know if it's joy or sorrow 
 I can't say how long I'll stand at the line that I'm towing 
 But I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going 
 All you see, a world so full of need 
 And all I need is a pocket full of seeds 
 Sunflowers shooting up to a sky that is glowing 
 And I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going 
 Prayed for rain, it might not come 
 Can't save the day, save someone 
 I can't say if the flowers will keep on growing 
 But I've got a good feeling about where I'm goingI don't miss where I came from 
 But each night, I dream about being back home 
 When I wake up in the morning 
 I'm too tired, too tired of being alone 
 So I get up and go downtown 
 And pick me out a little piece of ground 
 Where I can prove something to the world 
 I can prove something to the world 
 Don't look at me 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Don't look at me 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Daddy put us in the truck and 
 Dropped us off and said good luck and 
 One lucky kid waiting for the bus 
 Made a winner out of one of us 
 Don't look at me 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Don't look at me 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Goin' down by the railroad trackd 
 Where people know they'd better not relax 
 I'm the man, baby, I am the man 
 This is where I can make you understand 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Don't look at me 
 I'm the bus stop boxer 
 Don't look at meYour mama warned you, she was probably right 
 Said I be trouble all day and all night 
 She said my kind is not to take an old kind 
 She told them better was out there to find 
 Your mama warned you and she doesn't needs words 
 A life with him high that's for the birds 
 She said you listen and you take it from me 
 You just can't be what he needin to be 
 But you can't believe everything she says 
 There's a home called heaven within my head 
 You know that I mean well 
 Your mama warned you with an arrogant tone 
 Don't be a fool girl leave him alone 
 She so superior and so she just think 
 But I don't trust someone who's eyes never blink 
 No, you can't believe everything she says 
 There's a home called heaven within my head 
 You know that I mean well 
 All the things she'll never understand 
 I'll know she'll never be a fan 
 But she's not you 
 Your mama warned you, she was probably right 
 Said I be trouble all day and all night 
 She said my kind is not to take an old kind 
 She told them better was out there to find 
 And you can't believe everything she says 
 There's a home called heaven within my head 
 You know that I mean well 
 Your mama warned you.I had a date with a pretty ballerina 
 Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes 
 I asked her for this dance 
 And then she obliged me 
 Was I surprised, yeah 
 Was I surprised, 
 No not at all 
 I called her yesterday, 
 It should have been tomorrow 
 I could not keep 
 The joy that was inside 
 I begged for her to tell me 
 If she really loved me 
 Somewhere a mountain is moving 
 Afraid it's moving without me 
 I had a date with a pretty ballerina 
 Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes 
 I asked her for this dance 
 And then she obliged me 
 Was I surprised, yeah 
 Was I surprised, no not at all 
 And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning 
 I open up my eyes to find there's rain 
 And something strange within said, 
 "Go ahead and find her 
 Just close your eyes, yeah 
 Just close your eyes and she'll be there" 
 She'll be there...I know I'm not too much of a bargain 
 And you know that's not what you bargained for 
 As the hours turn into days 
 Pretty soon lost in the haze 
 It's up to you and me and who's to say 
 These could be the good old days 
 I like waking up after a bad dream 
 Makes it feel like life ain't bad 
 Little kids go out to play 
 They're just happy it's another day 
 It's up to you and me and who's to say 
 These could be the good old days 
 I guess I could be a quiet hero 
 No one knows the good I've done 
 You're not sure, well that's okay 
 'Cause I am and I'm not afraid 
 It's up to you and me and who's to say 
 These could be the good old daysIn this world of shit 
 Baby, you are it 
 A little light that shines all over 
 Must take over and see us through the night 
 Daddy was a troubled genius 
 Mama was a real good egg 
 Why don't we just get together 
 For whatever and see if it's all right 
 I spent so many days just starin' at the haze 
 I think that's a book that I don't have to write again 
 And when I rise I shine, I've got you on my mind 
 And the question isn't, "if", the question is merely "when" 
 Baby, I confess 
 I am quite a mess 
 So let's get married and make some people 
 More than equal in this world of shit 
 I will make a pledge 
 To get down off the ledge 
 You and I belong together 
 And forever we will have our lifeSaturday Morning 
 Who's gonna play with me? 
 Six in the morning, baby 
 I got a long, long day ahead of me 
 The parents are sleeping soundly 
 The neighbors are dead as wood 
 I'm getting up and coming over 
 We gotta rock the neighborhood 
 Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here 
 If we don't make it happen 
 Sleep away the day if you want to 
 But I got something that I gotta do 
 It's Saturday Morning 
 And this ain't the place for me 
 I'm giving you warning, baby 
 We got a whole big, fat world to see 
 Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here 
 If we don't make it happen 
 Sleep away the day if you want to 
 But I got something that I gotta do 
 It's Saturday Morning 
 And who's gonna play with me? 
 Six in the morning, baby 
 I got a long, long day ahead of me 
 Saturday morning 
 Saturday morningShe has eyes disability blue 
 A German dog and strict curfew 
 And if one man's cage is another man's stage 
 Then she's turned the script to another page 
 And she doesn't really give a damn 
 What you have to say 
 She makes a call on her friend's cell phone 
 The operator answers and says "You're not alone" 
 And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor 
 Then she'll be the one running to the sea shore 
 Trying to tell the seagulls 
 This is home 
 And if one man's cage is another man's stage 
 Then she'll be the one wiser than her age 
 Trying to get the message to your earEveryone loves you 
 Nobody cares 
 An awful collection 
 Of enemies and friends 
 Congratulations to you 
 With sad regrets 
 I'm tired of the old shit 
 Let the new shit begin 
 The psychic pain 
 Of living in this world 
 It's overwhelming me 
 Again and again 
 A beautiful afternoon 
 Inside you in your bed 
 I'm tired of the old shit 
 Let the new shit begin 
 Nobody loves you 
 Everyone cares 
 None of them know what's 
 Coming 'round the bend 
 Congratulations to me 
 Many happy returns 
 I'm tired of the old shit 
 Let the new shit beginThe smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky 
 The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye 
 The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage 
 The ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh 
 The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair 
 She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care 
 Come on 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh 
 The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair 
 Finger on the trigger, let me tell you, it is quite a scare 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh 
 The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound 
 My neighbor digs the flavor, still he's moving to another town 
 And I don't believe he'll come back 
 Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh 
 And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see 
 You don't believe anyone, but most of all, don't believe me 
 Only you 
 Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 (only you) 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
 Uh-huhIt was late, had some drinks 
 It was only our second date 
 She looked good, real, real good 
 I wanted to do what I could 
 I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking 
 How deep the water may be 
 But I knew this was it, we each said to get 
 A $200 Tattoo 
 It hurt a little, hell, it hurt a lot 
 But a man who won't commit is something I'm not 
 A little tear rolled down her face 
 When it was done we went back to her place 
 I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking 
 How deep the water may be 
 But I knew she's the one, and I'm telling you, son 
 I got a $200 Tattoo, she did too 
 A $200 TattooWhen you called 
 Your voice was so grave 
 I knew it would be 
 The last time we spoke 
 You said something 
 That I could not bear 
 To hear with my own ears 
 The last time we spoke 
 And it's a hard time 
 Trying to get through 
 All the days that drag on 
 Thinking about you 
 Nothing hurts 
 Like someone who knows 
 Everything about you 
 Leaving you behind 
 And it's a hard time 
 Trying to get through 
 All the days that drag on 
 Thinking about you 
 When you called 
 You might as well have killed me 
 And that was the last time 
 The last time we spokeSee this watch she gave me? 
 Well it still ticks away 
 The days I'm claiming back for me 
 The medication's wearing off 
 Gonna hurt not a little, a lot 
 Keep on tickin' you're not lickin' me 
 Step on a crack break your mother's heart 
 Red light, green light, black 
 Suicide e-mail do not delete 
 Plug it back in the jack 
 Start to be what they want you to be 
 And you see yourself as they see you 
 Sunrise at the corner of Sunset and Alvarado 
 I think, 
 "What the hell do I do now?" 
 Watch the day disintegrate 
 So I can stay up late and wait 
 See this watch she gave me? 
 Well it still ticks awayShe’s got her life living in her heart 
 She’s got these eyes well where do I start? 
 Like looking at the deep night sky 
 So many worlds inside her eyes 
 She’s a spectacular girl 
 Part of the job of being a man 
 Is knowing when to let go of her hand 
 A kind of power, it can’t be reined in 
 To hold her back would be a sin 
 She’s a spectacular girl 
 She sees the beauty in things we all miss 
 All good things are defined by the kiss 
 If you feeling like you can’t believe 
 Well then how do you explain the miracle I see 
 She’s a spectacular girl 
 Spectacular girl 
 Not a desire and not a need 
 Some things just happen because they have to be 
 I’m gonna get there, I’m telling you sir 
 I’m a man on a mission and I’m all about her 
 She’s a spectacular girl 
 Spectacular girl 
 Oh yeah 
 My loveBlinking lights on the airplane wings 
 Up above the trees 
 Blinking down a morse code signal 
 Especially for me 
 Ain't no rainbow in the sky 
 In the middle of the night 
 But the signal's coming through 
 One day I will be alright again 
 Blinking lights on the highway cars 
 Stopping one by one 
 Get a look at the accident 
 Didn't see that one coming 
 And the doctor in the sky 
 Gonna bring his chopper down 
 Gonna bring me out alive 
 And set me on the ground once more again 
 Blinking lights on the airplane wings 
 Up above the treesDo you know what it's like to fall on the floor 
 Cry your guts out till you got no more? 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl 
 Made you feel like it's not such a bad world? 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 Now you're really giving everything 
 And you're really getting all you gave 
 Now you're really livin' what this life is all about 
 Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill 
 Never used to give me much of a thrill (hey) 
 But hey man, now I'm really livin' 
 (Hey) 
 (Hey) 
 (Hey) 
 Do you know what it's like to care too much 
 'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch? 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 Have you ever sat down in the fresh-cut grass (hey) 
 And thought about the moment and when it will pass? (hey) 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 Now you're really givin' everything 
 And you're really gettin' all you gave 
 Now you're really livin' what this life is all about 
 Now what would you say if I told you that 
 Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat? 
 Hey man, now you're really living 
 Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor (hey) 
 Cry your guts out till you got no more? (hey) 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl (hey) 
 Made you feel like it's not such a bad world? (hey) 
 Hey man, now you're really livin' 
 People, sing

 (Hey) 
 (Hey)Crazy guy with a matted beard 
 Standing on the corner 
 Shouting out "end times are near" 
 And nobody notices 
 But I can hear him loud and clear 
 She is gone now and nowhere near 
 Seems like end times are here 
 I walk around a puddle in the street 
 And head on home 
 Outside my window there's a cat in heat 
 Shut up, cat, and leave me alone 
 There ain't no heat around here 
 I don't feel nothing now, not even fear 
 Now that end times are here 
 Now everyone's crazy, they've lost their minds 
 Just look at the world 
 It could all be over at any old time 
 And I can hear it loud and clear 
 The world is ending and what do I care? 
 She's gone, end times are hereLookin' downtown sun-riser sam 
 Bring it on down now i'm in a jam 
 Where did you find such a rockin' vest? 
 So get away kid, you've become a pest 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Silky gown 
 Pink and brown 
 Shut you down 
 And shut you up 
 Little lizard legs and rubber lizard tails 
 Always taste better when you're sittin' in jail 
 Still I don't think that I can resist 
 After all the times that I had to kiss 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Keep at arms length from the long armed law 
 Goin' to the bank for a $50 withdrawl 
 Gonna find the place where the weirdos hang 
 Knockin' on the door for a $50 bang 
 Silky gown 
 Pink and brown 
 Shut you down 
 And shut you up 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Heaven can't help a teenage witch

 Hello Jesus calls 
 A ring on the phone means 
 A trip to Niagara Falls 
 Daddy, don't let me down this time 
 I'm all alone inside my mind 
 And it's no small thing 
 That I must prove to you 
 A late night card game 
 With the guys is alright 
 But I would rather take you 
 For a test drive 
 Daddy, don't let me down this time 
 I'm all alone inside my mind 
 And it's no small thing 
 That I must prove to you 
 While I look out 
 On the passing fields 
 The sun through the bugs 
 On the windshield 
 Makes me feel like I don't matter 
 A knock on the door means 
 Hello Jesus calls 
 A ring on the phone means 
 A trip to Niagara FallsGoing to your funeral and feeling I could scream 
 Everything goes away 
 Driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream 
 A perfect day for perfect pain 
 Look at all the people with the flowers in their hands 
 They put the flower on the box that's holding all the sand 
 That was... 
 That was once... 
 That was once you 
 Honolulu hurricane, I knew that you were not insane 
 Living in the insane world 
 Smiling like it's no big deal, scabby wounds that never heal 
 The woman was only a girl 
 Look at all the people with their heads down in their hands 
 When everything I'm feeling makes it hard to understand 
 That what, what I need to miss, it's 
 It's what I need to miss... is you 
 Going to your funeral and I'm feeling like a fool 
 No one's gonna take the blame 
 Thinking about the days of hanging out behind the school 
 Everything goes awayIf I lay my head down 
 I will see you in my dream 
 Wearing that polka-dot dress 
 And sitting by the stream 
 Leaning in to hear you 
 You will whisper in my ear 
 And everything I need to know 
 I finally hear 
 I wish I could remember 
 But my selective memory won't let me 
 When I was a baby 
 We would go out to the park 
 And sit out in the fountain 
 Splashing 'round until it's dark 
 The days go on forever 
 When you only know that much 
 And everything you need to know 
 Is answered with one touch 
 I wish could remember 
 But my selective memory won't let meGoing over to Susan's house 
 Walking south down Baxter Street 
 Nothing hiding behind this picket fence 
 There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk 
 Where her house burnt down two years ago 
 People say that back then she really wasn't that crazy 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Down by the Donut Prince a fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk 
 With a bullet in his forehead 
 In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes 
 For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag 
 Meanwhile and old couple argues inside the Queen Bee 
 The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house

 Take a left down Echo Park 
 Take a left down Echo Park 
 Take a left down Echo Park 
 A kid asks do I want some crack 
 TV sets are spewing Baywatch 
 Through the windows into black 
 Here comes a girl with long brown hair 
 Who can't be more than seventeen 
 She sucks on a red popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage 
 And I'm thinking that must be her sister 
 That must be her sister, right? 
 They go into the 7-11 and I keep walking 
 And I keep walking 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house) 
 Going over to Susan's house

 Going over to Susan's house 
 (Susan's house)Nobody's quite sure how it became 
 But something so good could become of this day 
 But she's like a dream where you've lost all your fear 
 And in this life you're lucky 
 To have even one good friend 
 And it's her that I'll miss in the end 
 Love stories come and then love stories go 
 But this is the one that I'll always know 
 She is the one that makes me believe 
 And in this life you've got yourself 
 On which you can depend 
 But it's her that I'll miss in the end 
 Yeah, it's her that I'll miss in the end 
 Love is a word that gets thrown 'round a lot 
 Sometimes it means something other times not 
 But she is the greatest love I'll ever know 
 And in this life you'll never know 
 What's waiting 'round the bend 
 But it's her that I'll miss in the end 
 Yeah, it's her that I'll miss in the end 
 It's her that I'll miss in the endI feel like an old railroad man 
 Ridin' out on the bluemont line 
 Hummin' along old dominion blues 
 Not much to see and not much left to lose 
 And I know I can walk along the tracks 
 It may take a little longer 
 But I'll know how to find my way back 
 I feel like an old railroad man 
 Who's really tried the best that he can 
 To make his life add up to something good 
 But this engine no longer burns on wood 
 And I guess I may never understand 
 The times that I live in 
 Are not made for a railroad man 
 I feel like an old railroad man 
 Getting on board at the end of an age 
 The station's empty and the whistle blows 
 Things are faster now and this train is just too slow 
 And I know I can walk along the tracks 
 It may take a little longer 
 But I'll know how to find my way backComin' through the alley tryin' to walk without a sound 
 It doesn't really matter 'cause there ain't no one around 
 Tiptoe through the alley and tiptoe through your life 
 You still got it coming be it gun, be it knife 
 Next thing you know 
 You're eating hospital food 
 Karaoke castration, take the wasp alive 
 He's gonna sting you anyway and take you to the hive 
 Yesterday was suckin' and tomorrow's lookin' bad 
 Who knew that today was the only thing I had? 
 (What? What? I can hear you. I was, uh...) 
 Hospital food 
 Want some hospital food 
 Hospital food 
 Delicious hospital food 
 In your tribute album to the world you must never forget 
 To sing the one about the cat who's always gettin' wet 
 He's always got a problem, he's a very bitter dude 
 And now he's complaining 'bout his hospital food 
 Hospital food 
 It's gonna help the medicine go down 
 Want some hospital food 
 Gonna take a walk without a sound 
 A little hospital food 
 Helps the spoonful of sugar come up 
 I want some hospital food 
 In your blender and in my cup 
 Hospital food 
 Hospital food 
 Hospital food 
 Hospital foodIn my younger days 
 This wouldn't have been so hard 
 I would've just shrugged it off 
 But now it's tough 
 I'm not so rough 
 I've got a little ways to go 
 It's not over yet, I know 
 But it feels 
 Not so far away 
 In my younger days 
 This still would've knocked me down 
 But I would've just bounced right back, you know 
 Now I'm a statistic 
 But I'm not fatalistic 
 I'm not yet resigned to fate 
 And I'm not gonna be ruled by hate 
 But it's strong 
 And it's filling up my days 
 In my younger days 
 I would've just chalked it up 
 As part of my ongoing education 
 But I've had enough 
 Been through some stuff 
 And I don't need any more misery 
 To teach me what I should be 
 I just need you backWhat is this note? 
 The sun kisses the morning dew 
 Just the way that I'm kissing you 
 The birds are tweeting in sweet harmony 
 Teaching the free world how to be free 
 The day is new and a good one too 
 How can I prove my love to you? 
 I wanna give you everything 
 Me and the birds, now we're gonna sing 
 When I wake up to your beautiful smile 
 Sometimes it takes me a little while 
 To realize that I am awake 
 And that living today will be a piece of cake 
 And I won't keep you for myself 
 No, you're not a toy on my shelf 
 The world needs to know that you're here 
 So spread your wings and fly, my dear 
 The day is new and a good one too 
 How can I prove my love to you? 
 I wanna give you everything 
 Me and the birds, now we're gonna sing 
 The day is new and a good one too 
 How can I prove my love to you? 
 I wanna give you everything 
 Me and the birds, now we're gonna singYou're dead but the world keeps spinning 
 Take a spin through the world you left 
 It's getting dark a little too early 
 Are you missing the dearly bereft? 
 Taking flight and you could be here tomorrow 
 Taking flight, well, you could get here tonight 
 I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town 
 What? 
 I'm gonna fly on down then fly away 
 Well, alright 
 Get down 
 Takin' a spin throught the neighbourhood 
 The neighbours scream, 
 "Whatchya talkin' bout?" 
 'Cause they don't know how to let you in 
 And I can't let you out 
 What if I was not your only friend in this world 
 Can you take me where you're going if you're never coming back? 
 I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town 
 I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way 
 Get down 
 Why don't we take a ride away up high through the neighbourhood 
 Up over the billboards and the factories and smoke 
 I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town 
 Yeah 
 I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way 
 Fly away 
 Get downI need some sleep, I can't go on like this 
 I tried counting sheep but there's one I always miss 
 Everyone says I'm getting down too low 
 Everyone says you just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 I need some sleep, time to put the old horse down 
 I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinnin' 'round 
 Everyone says I'm getting down too low 
 Everyone says you just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 Just gotta let it goSo I wrote it all in a letter 
 I don't know if it came 
 The nurse, she likes my writing 
 So she keeps it just like me 
 So that it won't get away 
 I won't be denied this time 
 Before I go out of my mind 
 Over matters, got my foot on the ladder 
 And I'm climbing up to the moon 
 Got a sky that looks like Heaven 
 Got an Earth that looks like shit 
 It's getting hard to tell where 
 What I am ends and what they're making me begins 
 And I won't be denied this time 
 Before I go out of my mind 
 Over matters, got my foot on the ladder 
 And I'm climbing up to the moon 
 Saturday in the yard 
 They'll bring you by 
 We'll lay down on the grass 
 And watch as the sky closes in 
 I won't be denied this time 
 Before I go out of my mind 
 Over matters, got my foot on the ladder 
 And I'm climbing up to the moon 
 Climbing up to the moonThere's a world outside 
 And I know, 'cause I've heard talk 
 In my sweetest dream 
 I would go out for a walk 
 But I don't think I'm ready yet 
 Not feelin' up to it now 
 Just not that steady yet 
 And I don't need you telling me how 
 There's some happiness 
 If my stone face cracks again 
 Maybe some time sooner or later 
 But I don't think I'm ready yet 
 I'm not feelin' up to it now 
 Just not that steady yet 
 And I don't need you telling me how 
 So if I leave my room 
 Don't you tell me to lighten up 
 Maybe some time sooner or later 
 But I don't think I'm ready yet 
 Not feelin' up to it now 
 Just not that steady yet 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't need you telling me how 
 I don't, don't need you telling me howDear cousin, I got your letter 
 It was more than I thought I deserved 
 Well she sounds perfect, all I dream of 
 And I dream about so much it is absurd 
 But when I get there and she sees me 
 I'll be impressed if she does not run screaming 
 My kind of love is an ugly love 
 But it's real and it lasts a long, long time 
 I had a thought while I was sleeping 
 And I dreamed about a place for us to rest 
 Eternity under the old oak tree 
 But I go too far i guess 
 Maybe I'll think about tomorrow 
 And maybe I can get her to stay that long 
 'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love 
 But it's real and it lasts a long, long time 
 And if she finds me so repulsive 
 She wouldn't be the first to wretch 
 Well I decided one day long ago 
 I was never gonna be the greatest catch 
 And if she cares about the car I drive 
 Then she can get in hers the moment I arrive 
 'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love 
 But it's real and it lasts a long, long time 
 My kind of love is an ugly love 
 But it's real and it lasts a long, long timeI never thought that I could be so bold 
 To even say these thoughts aloud 
 I see you with your man, your eyes just shine 
 While he stands tall and walking proud 
 That look you give that guy 
 I wanna see looking right at me 
 If I could be that guy instead of me 
 I'd never let you down 
 It always seems like you're going somewhere 
 Better than you've been before 
 While I go to sleep and I dream all night 
 Of you knocking on my door 
 That look you give that guy 
 I wanna see looking right at me 
 If I could be that guy instead of me 
 I'd be all I can be 
 I'd be all I can be 
 I'm nothing like what I'd like to be 
 I'm nothing much I know it's true 
 I lack the style and the pedigree 
 And my chances are so few 
 That look you give that guy 
 I wanna see looking right at me 
 If I could be that guy instead of me 
 I'd give you all I got 
 I never thought that I could be so bold 
 To even say these thoughts aloud 
 But if, let's say, it won't work out 
 You know where I can be found 
 That look you give that guy 
 I wanna see looking right at me 
 If I could be that guy instead of me 
 I'd never let you down 
 I'd never let you downHow does a little baby know how to smile? 
 How does a cat land on his feet? 
 Why does it feel like you've been here before? 
 How do the two perfect people meet?

 Disappeared just overnight

 How does a mother wake up in the night 
 When she knows her daughter's sad 
 On the other side of the earth? 
 How does she know the kind of day she's had?

 And find the strength to rise above 
 Havin' nothing to call his own? 
 How does he find that he still has love?

 And then she finally gave birth 
 Years go by, still I don't know 
 Who shall inherit this earth 
 And no one will know my name until it's on a stone 
 Woah 
 This could be your lucky day in hell 
 Never know who it might be at your doorbell 
 This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell 
 Waking up with an ugly face 
 Winston Churchill in drag 
 Looking for new maternal embrace 
 Another tired old gag 
 Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones? 
 Woah 
 This could be your lucky day in hell 
 Never know who it might be at your doorbell 
 This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell 
 Father Theresa, you can't make me into you 
 I never wanna be like you 
 Why can't you see, it's me 
 You know it's time to let me go 
 This could be your lucky day in hell 
 Never know who it might be at your doorbell 
 This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell, in hell

 Buried alive beneath my life's rubble 
 I'll tell you what's really making me sad 
 You're disinterest is driving me mad 
 You're so fine 
 If you were mine I'd love you up 
 Give me a sign my darling 
 Well, I can shine if you'd just let me know 
 What's a fella gotta do 
 To spend a little time with you? 
 What's a fella gotta do 
 To spend a little time with you? 
 I'm so tired of feeling I could be more 
 I need a purpose, what am I for 
 What I'd like after close inspection 
 Is for you to look in my direction

 Anything to make the heart beat faster 
 But I got a feeling we could be so right 
 Make my day, I'll make your night

 (Is for you to look in my direction)She put on her party dress 
 I put on my jacket and walked out the door 
 Didn't have nowhere to go 
 Didn't matter that the night was getting cold 
 Pulled her closer to me 
 To keep her warm 
 And everything was beautiful and free 
 In the beginning 
 She woke up late in the morning 
 I pulled the curtain back, the sun came pouring in 
 Wasn't no one in the world 
 Wasn't nothing else, just me and my girl 
 She put her arms around me 
 Gave me a kiss 
 And everything was beautiful and free 
 In the beginningLife is hard and so am I 
 You'd better give me something, so I don't die 
 Novocaine for the soul 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter out 
 Life is white and I am black 
 Jesus and his lawyer are coming back 
 Oh my darling, will you be here 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter out 
 Guess who's living here with the great undead 
 This paint-by-numbers life is fucking with my head 
 Once again 
 Life is good and I feel great 
 'Cause mother says I was a great mistake 
 Novocaine for the soul 
 You'd better give me something to fill the hole 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter out 
 Before I sputter outWell it's a pretty bad place outside this door 
 I could go out there but I don't see what for 
 And I'm happy living here in the dark 
 On the edge of my mind 
 And it's nobody else's business 
 Now it's just me myself I and the secrets that live within the walls 
 Of the mansions of los feliz 
 Well the city's on fire you can smell the flesh 
 And the screams like dogs in the wilderness 
 And where all the poor souls go 
 Looking to mend their hearts 
 Like it's everyone else's business 
 And at best they'll find the secrets that live within the walls 
 Of the mansions of los feliz 
 Well he's gone out again and left you all alone 
 Come on over I'm always home 
 And where do the poor souls go 
 Looking to mend their hearts 
 Well I do mean to make it my business 
 And it's just me myself and the secrets that live within the walls 
 Of the mansions of los felizFeeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed 
 Walk down any street 
 Pass the people you meet 
 What is it about this place that keeps you on your feet 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed 
 Night is coming down 
 Closer to the ground 
 Gonna have a little fun while I'm still around 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed 
 Don't believe the words they say to you 
 When they are so absurd 
 Don't believe a word they say about me 
 Because I'm feeling mighty fine 
 Think I gotta go 
 Think I'm gonna die 
 Oh my God somethings wrong 
 The end is coming near because I'm 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am 
 Yes I amSpunky don't like her uniform 
 It never fit so good 
 Goin' back to the orphanage 
 And the place where her garage once stood 
 Well it's a free for all, free for all, free for all 
 It's a free for all, you and me 
 And if you don't like what they're telling you 
 You can't teach a blind man to see 
 Well I can see 
 Spunky looks good in her bright red wig 
 Eating chocolate-chip mint ice cream 
 A cat named Lola with a violent past 
 Is balled up asleep 'cross her knees 
 And it's a free for all, free for all, free for all 
 It's a free for all, you and me 
 One day the world will be ready for you 
 And wonder how they didn't see 
 Spunky knows she can save the world 
 In her own little way 
 Turning in her old uniform 
 'Cause you know, it really didn't pay 
 'Cause it's a free for all, free for all, free for all 
 It's a free for all, you and me 
 I walk through the world with your name on my tongue 
 And your picture etched on my screenShe hides in the library reading 
 Henry Miller 
 books 
 Till they flash the lights, it's time to go 
 When she was a little kid, she said 
 "Dad, I don't know why I feel so penniless inside." 
 She's on the promenade 
 She's looking for a dress 
 She's locked outside a world 
 Just a Manchester girl 
 Oh, I'll meet you there by the old newsstand 
 Oh, I'll meet you there tonight 
 Shoot out at the neighbor's house 
 She pulls the covers over her head 
 She's counting the shots as they go by 
 In Pandora's litter box 
 Well, it's getting mighty high 
 That cat's gonna keep her up at night 
 Another scary dream 
 Another cigarette 
 She's locked outside a world 
 Just a Manchester girl 
 Oh, I'll meet you there by the old newsstand 
 Oh, I'll meet you there tonightI've got your picture 
 And your black book 
 Smells like your perfume 
 On the walks that we took 
 And I love you 
 And you love me 
 But we're apart 
 'Cause I read 
 The cheater's guide to your heart 
 Think of it this way 
 It was never meant to be, I guess 
 But know at the end of 
 The day I felt blessed 
 And I love you 
 And you love me 
 But we're apart 
 'Cause I read 
 The cheater's guide to your heart 
 Well it may be long till you see me again 
 So paint me as a good one, my friend 
 And I love you 
 And you love me 
 But we're apart 
 'Cause I read 
 The cheater's guide to your heartDon't cry 
 All the songs you sing 
 All the flowers you bring 
 Are part of everything there ever was 
 And will be 
 Go on 
 You've got places to be 
 So many things to see 
 Don't worry about me 
 I'm already where I should be 
 Look up 
 A plane writes in the sky 
 For every passer by 
 No one ever dies 
 They just write things in the sky 
 If you 
 Wanna think about me 
 Look out above the sea 
 And you can see that I am doing 
 Just fineFish in the sea, you know how I feel 
 River runnin' free, you know how I feel 
 Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel 
 It's a new dawn 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new life for me 
 And I'm feeling good 
 Dragonfly in the sun, you know what I mean 
 Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean 
 Sleepin' peace when day's done, that's what I mean 
 And this whole world 
 Is a new world 
 And a gold world for me 
 Stars when you shine, you know how I feel 
 Scent of the pine, you know how I feel 
 Yeah, freedom's mine and I know how I feel 
 It's a new dawn 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new life for me 
 And I'm feeling goodWhy dont you get me a way out of here 
 Buy me a ticket, a seat in the rear 
 'Cause I'd say the daylight is time to go home 
 Every day 
 Voice in my ear 
 Telling me 
 "Get out of here" 
 I think that you know it's not so bad 
 Sitting in rust and taking a bath 
 But I think that I could find a new way 
 Every day 
 Voice in my ear 
 Telling me 
 "Get out of here" 
 Why dont you just think about it a while 
 Maybe I'm too much cramping your style 
 But now that it's daylight, it's time to go home 
 Every day 
 Voice in my ear 
 Telling me 
 "Get out of here"Da da da da da da

 And I may not be here for you again

 Dead reckoning 
 My gauges can't be trusted 
 Can't see a goddamn thing 
 I know the day is coming 
 That catches up with me 
 I told you you're no match 
 But then who could be 
 Thought we were the lonely type 
 On an island of the lost 
 But it was only me 
 Because you got lost 
 I can't change you 
 I can't change anyoneI am building a shrine 
 Deep inside my heart 
 It’s filled with all the little things 
 I’ll take when I depart 
 All the love you bring me 
 All the tender words you sing me 
 And all the suns within your smile 
 All the wisdom of your ways 
 Enduring endless days 
 And all the love that never dies 
 Deep down in the cold ground 
 Such a sad place to be 
 But I'll be fine with all the little things 
 That I’m taking with me 
 All the love you bring me 
 All the tender words you sing me 
 And all the suns within your smile 
 All the wisdom of your ways 
 Enduring endless days 
 And all the love that never dies 
 All the love you bring me 
 All the tender words you sing me 
 And all the suns within your smile 
 All the wisdom of your ways 
 Enduring endless days 
 And all the love that never dies
