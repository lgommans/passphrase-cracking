Clouds roll by 
 Reeling is what they say 
 Or is it just my way? 
 Wind blows by 
 Low light 
 Sidetracked 
 Low light 
 Can't see my tracks 
 Your scent way back 
 Can I be here all alone? 
 Clear a path to my home 
 Blood runs dry 
 Books and jealousy tell me wrong 
 I will feel calm 
 Voice blows by 
 Low light 
 Car crash 
 Low light 
 Can't wear my mask 
 Your first, my last 
 Voice blows by 
 Two birds is what they'll see 
 Getting lost upon their way 
 Wind blows by 
 Low light 
 Eye sight 
 Low light 
 I need the light 
 I'll find my way from wrong 
 What's realDrive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home. 
 I'll take a walk so I could curse my ass for being dumb. 
 I'll make a right, after the arches, stinking grease and bone. 
 Stopped at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog. 
 I'm going to Lukin's. 
 I've got a spot at Lukin's. 
 I knocked the door at Lukin's. 
 Open the fridge. Now I know life is worth. 
 I found the key but I return to find an open door. 
 Some fucking freak who claims I fathered, by rape, her own son. 
 I find my wife, I call the cops, this days work's never done. 
 The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun.I got bugs 
 I got bugs in my room 
 Bugs in my bed 
 Bugs in my ears 
 Their eggs in my head 
 Bugs in my pockets 
 Bugs in my shoes 
 Bugs in the way I feel about you 
 Bugs on my window 
 Trying to get in 
 They don't go nowhere 
 Waiting, waiting 
 Bugs on my ceiling 
 Crowded the floor 
 Standing, sitting, kneeling 
 A few block the door 
 And now the questions: 
 Do I kill them? 
 Become their friend? 
 Do I eat them? 
 Raw or well done? 
 Do I trick them? 
 I don't think they're dumb 
 Do I join them? 
 Looks like that's the one 
 I got bugs on my skin 
 Tickle my nausea 
 I let it happen again 
 They're always takin' over 
 I see they surround me 
 I see, see them deciding my fate 
 Oh, that which was once, was once up to me 
 Now it's too late 
 I got bugs in my room, one-on-one 
 That's when I had a chance 
 I'll just stop now 
 I'll become naked 
 And with them, I'll become oneBut I think your drums are 
 No cheep ones 
 Hey everybody uh this is eddie from pearl jam 
 And jeff 
 And me too 
 And mike 
 And it's me mike 
 And I'd talk to you if I could fucking see you if I talk I'd fuck up the song so sorry 
 And he cusses too every time he talkes 
 And dave 
 Daves here 
 Daves not here and 
 Dave is in the house 
 Dave is here 
 I am the chief who undress in a green prom dress 
 He's not a quiet percussion one he's the new not quiet hard hitting one 
 I'm not the grinch cuse I didn't have a drink 
 Anyway we all thought we'd wish you a merry Christmas 
 And we're very happy right now 'cause we're on tour with the chilli peppers 
 And that's them playing in the background and a happy new year 
 And god bless everyone everywhere 
 That was mike he's tiny Tim now 
 And this is eddie saying I'm a rhino and my skin is two feet thick 
 So we'll leave you with this song and thank you again bye 
 Se you merry Christmas 
 Merry christman woo no cheep ones

 That was meant to blow up your speakers 
 This is my it's actually the devil in santa clauses suit after all if you switch the letters around in santa it speels satin 
 You gotta switch 'em around and change a couple of them 
 I just saw that last night on the news you know those little...(This song was played live in Champaign, IL) 
 Some people seem so obsessed with the morning 
 Get up early just to watch the sunrise 
 Others like it more when there's fire in the sky 
 Worship the sun when it's high 
 Some people go for those sultry evenings 
 Cocktails in the blue, red, and grey 
 But I like every minute of the day 
 I dig every second 
 So long as you are on my mind 
 Each precious moment has its special charm 
 It's all right when you're around, rain or shine 
 I know a crowd who only lives after midnight 
 Their faces always seem so pale 
 And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight 
 They say a suntan never fails 
 I know I was a man who worked a night shift 
 I was lucky to get a job and some pay 
 Now I like every minute of the day 
 I dig every second 
 I could laugh in the snow and rain 
 I get a buzz from being cold and wet 
 The pleasure seems to balance out the pain 
 And so you see that I'm completely crazy 
 I even shun the south of France 
 The people on my hill they say I'm lazy 
 But when they sing I... uh 
 But when they sleep I sing and dance 
 I know a crowd who... or something 
 Cocktails in the blue, red and grey 
 But I like every minute of the day 
 I like every minute of the day...Here, far away 
 One could feel the earth vibrate 
 Moon, changing shape and shade 
 As we all do under its gaze 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 'Round we go 
 Where we stop, yeah no one knows 
 So tonight, the moon I go 
 Yellow moon on the rise, ooh 
 An echo that rings 
 A bullet unchained 
 One life, one grave 
 Joins the parade, ah 
 The sky grows dark 
 With fallen stars 
 Who'd come so far 
 A headstone engraved 
 The colors turn gray 
 The black and white fades 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 Yellow moon on the rise 
 OohWell I stood stone-like at midnight 
 Suspended in my masquerade 
 I combed my hair 'til it was just right 
 And commanded the night brigade 
 I was open to pain 
 And crossed by the rain 
 And I walked with a crooked crutch 
 I strolled all alone 
 Through the fallout zone 
 Came out with my soul untouched 
 I stood in the crowd and read something loud 
 But when they said, "Put out," I stood up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 The flag of piracy flew from my mast 
 My sails were set wing to wing 
 I had a jukebox graduate for a first mate 
 She couldn't sail but she sure could sing 
 And I pushed B-52 
 And bombed 'em with the blues 
 With my gear set stubborn on standing 
 I strolled all alone 
 Through the fallout zone 
 Never once gave thought to landing 
 I stood in the crowd and read something loud 
 But when they said, "Put down," I put up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 I stood in the crowded warmth of the crowd 
 But when they said, "Sit down," I threw up 
 Ooh-ooh... 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up, yeahCome to send, not condescend 
 Transcendental consequence 
 Is to transcend where we are 
 Who are we, who we are 
 Trampled moss on your soul 
 Changes all, you're apart 
 Seen it all, not at all 
 Can't defend, fucked up, man 
 Take me for a ride before we leave 
 Circumstance, clapping hands 
 Driving winds, happenstance 
 Off the track, in the mud 
 That's the moss in the aforementioned verse 
 Just a little time, before we leave 
 Stoplight plays its part 
 So I would say you've got a part 
 What's your part? Who you are 
 You are who, who you areFree the people, oh... got your love, whoa... (X2) 
 Shower the people you love with love 
 Show them the way that you feel 
 (X2) 
 I'm special...'cause I'm gonna make you see 
 Nobody loves you, nobody like me 
 I'm special, so special 
 I got to have some of your attention, give it to me 
 'Cause I'm... 
 I'll kick the fuck out of you 
 Peaceful times have come and gone 
 It's time to fuckin' kill somebody 
 I try, don't blame me 
 I try, peacefully 
 That time has come and gone, now it's just me 
 Just me... this means nothin' no more 
 This don't mean nothin' no more 
 I don't want to see this no more 
 Unless you're ready,'less you're ready, to stand behind it... 
 I don't give a fuck 
 Let the words that you say to me 
 Unless the actions sustain it 
 It's meaningless... 
 We're all meaningless 
 The world will go on 
 And we're all meaningless 
 The world will spin 
 We're all meaningless 
 I refuse, I refuse, to believe 
 We're meaningless, meaningless 
 We're meaningless, I refuse... 
 I won't give up, yeah... 
 Meaningless... we're not meaningless 
 We're not invisible... we're not meaningless 
 If you love someone, tell 'em 
 Show them the way that you feel 
 Shower the people you love with love 
 Show them the way that you feel (X3) 
 Oh...Aye davanita, davanita, davanita, davanita 
 Davanita, davanita, davanita, davanita 
 Davanita, davanita, davanita, davanita 
 Davanita, davanita, davanita, davanitaHello, this is Abe Vigoda 
 And I just want to say that Alice in Chains rocked my worldWhen the spoon is hot 
 And the needles sharp 
 And you drift away 
 I can hear you say 
 That the world in black 
 Is upon your back 
 And your body shakes 
 So you ditch away 
 And you close the shades 
 Don't try to do it 
 Don't try to kill your time 
 You might do it 
 Then you can't change your mind 
 You've got a hold on to your time 
 Till your break through these 
 Times of trouble 
 When you try to talk 
 And the words get hard 
 And they put you down 
 Don't you stay 
 Don't you ditch away 
 I saw you swinging 
 Swinging your mothers sword 
 I know you're playing but 
 Sometimes the rules get hard 
 But if somebody left you out on a ledge 
 If somebody pushed you over the edge 
 If somebody loved you and left you for dead 
 You got to hold on to your time till you break 
 Through these times of troubleOoh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 I see the world 
 Feel the chill 
 Which way to go? 
 Windowsill 
 I see the words 
 On a rocking horse of time 
 I see the birds in the rain 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh, dear Dad 
 Can you see me now? 
 I am myself 
 Like you somehow 
 I'll ride the wave 
 Where it takes me 
 I'll hold the pain 
 Release me 
 Oh 
 Oh, I 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh, dear Dad 
 Can you see me now? 
 I am myself 
 Like you somehow 
 I'll wait up in the dark 
 For you to speak to me 
 I'll open up 
 Release me 
 Release me 
 Release me, Dad 
 Release me 
 Oh 
 Oh, I 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Ooh 
 OohWaitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o' clock, it's got to stop 
 Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech 
 As he opens the door, she rolls over 
 Pretends to sleep as he looks her over 
 She lies and says she's in love with him 
 Can't find a better man 
 She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
 Can't find a better man 
 Can't find a better man 
 Can't find a better man 
 Ohh 
 Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know 
 She tells herself, ooh 
 Memories back when she was bold and strong 
 And waiting for the world to come along 
 Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone 
 She lies and says she's in love with him 
 Can't find a better man 
 She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
 Can't find a better man 
 She lies and says she still loves him 
 Can't find a better man 
 She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
 Can't find a better man 
 Can't find a better man 
 Can't find a better man 
 She loved him, yeah 
 She don't want to leave this way 
 She feeds him, yeah 
 That's why she'll be back again 
 Can't find a better man 
 (can't find a better man) 
 Can't find a better man 
 (can't find a better man) 
 Can't find a better man 
 (can't find a better man) 
 Can't find a better manTried to remember but my feelings get old for sure 
 Tried to recall but it's gone 
 Lucky stars in your eyes 
 I'm walking the cow 
 I really don't know how I came here 
 I really don't know why I'm staying here 
 I'm walking the cow 
 Tried to point my finger but the wind keeps blowin' me around 
 In circles, in circles 
 Lucky stars in your eyes 
 I'm walking the cow 
 I really don't know what I have to fear 
 I really don't know why I have to care 
 I'm walking the cow 
 Lucky stars in your eyes...Hear the sirens 
 Hear the sirens 
 Hear the sirens 
 Hear the circus so profound 
 I hear the sirens 
 More and more in this here town 
 Let me catch my breath to breathe 
 And reach across the bed 
 Just to know we're safe 
 I am a grateful man 
 The slightest bit of light 
 And I can see you clear 
 Have to take your hand and feel your breath 
 For fear this someday will be over 
 I hold you close, so much to lose 
 Knowing that nothing lasts forever 
 I didn't care, before you were here 
 I danced in laughter with the everafter 
 But all things change 
 Let this remain 
 Hear the sirens 
 Covering distance in the night 
 The sound echoing closer 
 Will they come for me next time? 
 For every choice, mistake I've made 
 It's not my plan 
 To send you in the arms of 
 Another man 
 And if you choose to stay I'll wait 
 I'll understand 
 It's a fragile thing, this life we lead 
 If I think too much I can get over 
 Whelmed by the grace by which we live our lives 
 With death over our shoulders 
 Want you to know that should I go 
 I always loved you, held you high above, true 
 I study your face 
 The fear goes away 
 It's a fragile thing, this life we lead 
 If I think too much I can get over 
 Whelmed by the grace by which we live our lives 
 With death over our shoulder 
 Want you to know that should I go 
 I always loved you, held you high above, true 
 I study your face 
 And the fear goes away 
 The fear goes away 
 The fear goes away 
 The fear goes away 
 Ah ah, oh oh 
 Ah ah, oh oh 
 Ah ah, oh oh 
 Ah ah, oh ohOne more 
 Ah, there's one more that we haven't done, that one 
 Actually we did a verse in Birmingham, Alabama on this tour 
 And if you'd like to hear it, we'd love to play it for you 
 AhYes I understand that every life must end, aw huh 
 As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, aw huh 
 I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love 
 Some folks just have one, yeah others they got none, aw huh 
 Stay with me, oh let's just breathe 
 Practiced are my sins never gonna let me win, aw huh 
 Under everything, just another human being, aw huh 
 Yeah, I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed 
 Stay with me, you're all I see 
 Did I say that I need you? 
 Did I say that I want you? 
 Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool, you see 
 No one knows this more than me 
 As I come clean 
 I wonder every day as I look upon your face, aw huh 
 Everything you gave and nothing you would take, aw huh 
 Nothing you would take 
 Everything you gave 
 Did I say that I need you? 
 Oh did I say that I want you? 
 Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool, you see 
 No one knows this more than me 
 As I come clean 
 Nothing you would take 
 Everything you gave 
 Hold me till I die 
 Meet you on the other sideDon't it make you smile? 
 Don't it make you smile? 
 When the sun don't shine? (Shine at all...) 
 Don't it make you smile? 
 Don't it make you smile? 
 Don't it make me smile? 
 When the sun don't shine, it don't shine at all. 
 Don't it make me smile? 
 I miss you already... I miss you always. 
 I miss you already... I miss you all day. 
 This is how I feel... 
 I miss you already... I miss you always. 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all around... I miss you all day. 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all around, yeah. 
 Don't it make you smile? 
 Don't it make you smile? 
 Three crooked hearts and swirls all around.I took a drive today 
 Time to emancipate 
 I guess it was the beatings made me wise 
 But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize 
 I couldn't breathe, holding me down 
 Hand on my face, pushed to the ground 
 Enmity gauged, united by fear 
 Forced to endure what I could not forgive 
 I seem to look away 
 Wounds in the mirror waved 
 It wasn't my surface most defiled 
 Head at your feet, fool to your crown 
 Fist on my plate, swallowed it down 
 Enmity gauged, united by fear 
 Tried to endure what I could not forgive 
 Saw things 
 Saw things 
 Saw things 
 Saw things 
 Clearer 
 Clearer 
 Once you were in my rear view mirror 
 I gather speed from you fucking with me 
 Once and for all, I'm far away 
 I hardly believe, finally the shades are raised 
 Hey, yeah 
 Saw things so much clearer 
 (Once you, once you) 
 Rearviewmirror 
 Saw things so much clearer 
 (Once you, once you) 
 Rearviewmirror 
 Saw things so much clearer 
 (Once you, once you) 
 Rearviewmirror 
 Saw things so much clearer 
 Once you 
 Oh yeahRoutine was the theme, he'd wake up and... wash and pour himself into uniform 
 Something he hadn't imagined being... 
 As the merging traffic passed, he found himself staring, down, at his own hands... 
 Not remembering the change, not recalling the plan, was it...? 
 He was okay, but wondering about wandering 
 Was it age? by consequence? or was he moved by sleight of hand? 
 Mondays were made to fall, lost on a road he knew by heart 
 It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly... 
 Sometimes he hid in his radio, watching others pull into their homes 
 While he was drifting... 
 On a line, of his own, off the line, on the side 
 By the by, as dirt turned to sand, as if moved by sleight of hand 
 When he reached the shore of his clip-on world 
 He resurfaced to the norm 
 Organized his few things, his coat and keys... 
 Any new realizations would have to wait till he had more time, more time... 
 Time to dream, to himself 
 He waves goodbye, to himself 
 I'll see you on the other side... 
 Another man... moved by sleight of hand...If I keep holding out 
 Will the light shine through 
 Under this broken roof 
 It's only rain that I feel 
 I've been wishing out the days 
 Oh oh oh, come back 
 I have been planning out 
 All that I'd say to you 
 Since you slipped away 
 Know that I still remain true 
 I've been wishing out the days 
 Please say that if you hadn't gone now 
 I wouldn't have lost you another way 
 From wherever you are 
 Oh oh, oh oh oh, come back 
 And these days they linger on 
 And in the night I've been waiting for 
 The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams 
 I go to sleep 
 If I don't fall apart 
 Will my memory stay clear 
 So you had to go 
 And I had to remain here 
 But the strangest thing today 
 So far away and yet you feel so close 
 And I'm not gonna question it any other way 
 There must be an open door 
 For you, ooh, to come back 
 And the days they linger on 
 And every night when I'm waiting for 
 The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams 
 Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me 
 Come the morning I can swear that you're next to me 
 And it's okay 
 It's okay 
 It's okay 
 Oh, I'll be here, come back, come back 
 I, I'll be here, come back, come back 
 Oh, I'll be here, come back, come back 
 Whoo, whoo 
 Whoo, whooBee girl 
 You're gonna die 
 You don't wanna be famous 
 You wanna be shy 
 Do your dances 
 Alone in your room 
 Becoming a star 
 Will become your doom 
 Bee girl, be a girl 
 Bee girl, be a girl 
 You know time is long 
 And life is short 
 Begin to live 
 While you still can 
 Believe in nothing 
 Believe me 
 Those who can be trusted 
 Can change their mind 
 The anxious 
 Is the present 
 Unwrap your gifts 
 Take your time 
 Everything you imagined 
 Needn't be stuck in your mind 
 Bee girl, be a girl 
 Bee girl, be a girl

 I lost some people I was travelling with me 
 I missed a soul in the old friendshipState of love and trust as I busted down the pretext 
 Sin still plays and preaches, but to have an empty court, uh huh 
 And the signs are passin', grip the wheel, can't read it 
 Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah 
 And I listen for the voice inside my head 
 Nothin', I'll do this one myself 
 Lay her down as priest does, should the Lord be a-countin' 
 Will be in my honour, make it pain, painfully quick, uh huh 
 Promises are whispered in the age of darkness 
 Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end, end, yeah 
 And the barrel shakes, aimed, a-directly at my head 
 Oh, help me, help me from myself 
 And I listen, from both sides of the bed 
 Nothin', I'll do this one myself 
 Uh huh, huh, oh 
 Myself, myself 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Hey, na, na, na, na, hey, that's something 
 Hey, na, na, na, na, hey, that's something 
 Hey, na, na, na, na, hey, that's something 
 Wanna back, back it away, yeah, huh, uh 
 And I listen, oh, for the voice inside my head 
 Nothin', I'll do this one myself 
 Oh, ah, and the barrel waits, trigger shakes, aimed right at my head 
 Won't you help me, help me from myself

 This God forgotten place 
 First comes love, then comes pain 
 Let the games begin 
 Questions rise and answers fall 
 Insurmountable 
 Love boat captain 
 Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here 
 It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough 
 Is this just another phase 
 Of earthquakes making waves? 
 Trying to shake the cancer off 
 Aah, stupid human beings 
 Once you hold the hand of love 
 It's all surmountable 
 Hold me and make it the truth 
 That when all is lost, there'll be you 
 'Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing 
 And there's just one word I still believe 
 And it's love 
 It's an art to live with pain 
 Mix the light into gray 
 Lost nine friends we'll never know 
 Two years ago today 
 And if our lives became too long 
 Would it add to our regret? 
 And the young, they can lose hope 
 'Cause they can't see beyond today 
 The wisdom that the old can't give away, hey 
 Constant recall 
 Sometimes life don't leave you alone 
 Hold me and make it the truth 
 That when all is lost, there will be you 
 'Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing 
 And there's just one word that I still believe 
 And it's love, love, love, love, love 
 Love boat captain take the reigns 
 Steer us towards the clear 
 I know it's already been sung 
 Can't be said enough 
 Love is all you need 
 All you need is love

 Stole many a man's soul and face 
 And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
 Had his moment of doubt and pain 
 Made damn sure that Pilate 
 Washed his hand and sealed his fateHow come... 
 They do this to us? 
 This boy... (X2) 
 How come... 
 They make such a fuss? 
 Over this boy... 
 This boy... 
 He's there and I... don't know what to do... 
 This boy... (X2) 
 Nothin'... 
 To look up there into 
 This boy... (X2)Oh, I see that on a porch a letter sat 
 Then he said, "I wanna leave it" again 
 Once I saw him on a beach of weathered sand 
 And on the sand, "I wanna leave it" again, yeah 
 "I wanna leave here, wanna get wasted on the way," yeah 
 Then I called, and I said that I want what I said, then I called out again 
 And the reason, wanna leave here, how come, I know 
 I said, "I know but will it be a box or a bag" 
 Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch 
 Yeah, but they don't wave 
 I see them round the front way, yeah 
 And I know and I know I don't want to stay 
 Make me cry 
 Ah, I see 
 Ooh, I don't know, there's something else 
 I want to drum it all away 
 Oh, and I said that 
 I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag 
 Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch 
 Yeah, but they don't wave 
 But I see them round the front way, yeah 
 And I know and I know I don't want to stay alone 
 I don't wanna stay, yeah 
 I don't wanna stay 
 I don't wanna stay, oh, no 
 YeahGot all night 
 Plenty of time 
 Take these chains 
 From my eyes 
 So alive 
 Getting pride 
 Take her down 
 Before you die 
 Right be satisfied 
 We've got all night 
 Is he here 
 Top of the stairs 
 No place for 
 The president 
 Build some fears 
 Slip outside 
 Fuck, be content 
 To just get by 
 Why be satisfied 
 We've got all night 
 Ah 
 Scream and wail 
 See who cares 
 Scream and wail 
 See who cares 
 Life has nothin' to do with 
 Killin' time 
 Oh well 
 Right, be satisfied 
 We've got 
 All night 
 We've got all night 
 We've got all nightThe sirens scream wanton attention 
 Time to take heed and change direction 
 Time to take stock and make omissions 
 Evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 Time to take leave all formal functions 
 Time to plant seeds of a reconstruction 
 No time this time to feign reluctance 
 It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way. 
 Bets put aside you're evil 
 Lets crawl into your face 
 A vision vague or not raising a frightful wake you up 
 Time for evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 Evacuation 
 There was a solemn man 
 Watched his twilight disappear 
 (in the sand) 
 Altered by a falling eagle. A warning sign. Sign. 
 He sensed that worry could be strength with a plan he said, 
 "Time for evacuation." 
 Evacuation

 EvacuationWinded is the sailor 
 Drifting by the storm 
 Wounded is the organ he left all 
 Bloodied on the shore 
 Gorgeous was his savior, sees her 
 Drowning in his wake 
 Daily taste the salt of her tears, but 
 A chance blamed fate 
 Little secrets, tremors turned to quakes 
 The smallest oceans still get big, big waves 
 Ransom paid the devil 
 He whispers pleasing words 
 Triumphant are the angels 
 If they can get there first 
 Little secrets, tremors turn to quakes 
 The smallest oceans still get big, big waves 
 I'll decide, take the dive 
 Take my time, not my life 
 Wait for signs, believe in lies 
 To get by, it's divine, whoa 
 Oh, you know what it's like 
 Turns the bow back, tows 
 And drops the line 
 Puts his faith in love 
 And tremor ChristEvery night with the lights out, where you gone?

 He expects her to be easy 
 He wants it to be easy 
 But she says no, she says no I don't want to 
 She says no, she says no, I don't want to 
 He expects it too, e-easy 
 But she says stop, you gotta stop 
 When he says go, you still gotta stop 
 When she says stop, you gotta stop 
 When he says go, you still gotta stop

 And burn your bridges down 
 We make a little history, baby 
 Every time you come around 
 Come loose your dogs upon me 
 And let your hair hang down 
 You are a little mystery to me 
 Every time you come around 
 We talked about it all night long 
 We define our moral ground 
 But when I crawl into your arms 
 Everything comes tumbling down 
 Come sail your ships around me 
 And burn your bridges downSo, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. 
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? 
 Do you think you can tell? 
 And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? 
 Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? 
 And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? 
 How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
 We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, 
 Running over the same old ground. What have you found? The same old fears. 
 Wish you were here.How does he do it? How do they do it? Uncanny and immutable 
 This is such a happening tailpipe of a party 
 Like sugar, the guests are so refined 
 A confidence man, but why so beleaguered? 
 He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer 
 Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike 
 Drilling for fear makes the job simple 
 Born on third, thinks he got a triple 
 Blackout weaves its way through the cities 
 Blackout weaves its way through the cities 
 Blackout weaves its way 
 I remember when you sang 
 That song about today 
 Now it's tomorrow and 
 Everything has changed 
 A think tank of aloof multiplication 
 A nicotine wish and a columbus decanter 
 Retrenchment and hoggishness 
 The aristocrat choir sings 
 "What's the ruckus?" 
 The haves have not a clue 
 The immenseness of suffering 
 And the odd negotiation, a rarity 
 With onion-skin plausibility of life 
 And a keyboard reaffirmation 
 Blackout weaves its way through the cities 
 Blackout weaves its way through the cities 
 Blackout weaves its way 
 I remember when you sang 
 That song about today 
 Now it's tomorrow and 
 Everything has changed.Oh, girls just wanna have fun... 
 They just wanna, they just wanna... (3x) 
 Be left aloneWhen people keep repeating that you'll never fall in love 
 When everybody keeps retreating, but you can't seem to get enough 
 Let my love open the door, let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door to your heart 
 Let my love open the door, ooh 
 Let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door, ooh 
 Let my love open the door 
 When everything feels all over, everybody seems unkind 
 I'll give you a four-leaf clover, take all worry out of your mind 
 Let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door to your heart 
 Let my love open the door, ooh, to your heart 
 Let my love open the door, ooh 
 Let my love open the door, ooh 
 Let my love open the door, ooh 
 I got the only key to your heart 
 I can stop you falling apart 
 Try today, you'll find this way 
 Come on and give me a chance to say 
 Let my love open the door, it's all I'm living for 
 Release yourself from misery 
 There's only one thing going to set you free 
 That's my love, that's my love 
 Let my love open the door (to your heart) 
 Let my love open the door (to your heart) 
 Let my love open the door (to your heart) 
 Let my love open the door 
 When tragedy befalls you, don't let it drag you down 
 Love can cure your problems, you're so lucky I'm around 
 Let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door 
 Let my love open the door to your heartThe sun was in clouds, the sun looked out 
 Exposed a trail of mist and spouts 
 Ships followed the ancient lead 
 Deceiving friends under the sea 
 Wow, imagine that? They won't fight back 
 I got a theory on that 
 A whale's heart is as big as a car 
 A whaler's thought must be smudged by the dark 
 They won't fight back, I'm sure they know how 
 Means they love or are too proud 
 They won't fight back, I'm sure they know how 
 Means they love or are too proud 
 They swim, it's really free 
 It's a beautiful thing to see 
 They sing 
 Hunters of land, hunters of sea 
 Exploit anything for money 
 I refer to anybody 
 That takes advantage of what that is free 
 (They won't fight back) 
 It's only a thought that makes it seem right 
 What you don't see is because of your sight 
 Take what you want, kill what you can 
 That's just one way from the mind of man 
 Take their lives, sell their parts 
 But there's no taking of their hearts 
 If I was lost at sea 
 That harpoon boat in front of me 
 It's the whale I'd like to be 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight back 
 They don't know how 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight back 
 They won't fight backHere's a token of my openness 
 Of my need to not disappear 
 How I'm feeling, so revealing to me 
 I found my mind too clear 
 I just need someone to be there for... me 
 I just want someone to be there for... me 
 All the static in my attic-a 
 Shoots down my side nerve 
 To the ocean of my platitudes 
 Longitudes, latitudes, it's so absurd 
 I just need someone to be there for... 
 I just want someone to be there for... 
 Someone to be there for 
 I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 I'm not trying to make a difference 
 I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 No way 
 'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 I'm not trying to make a difference 
 I'm not trying to make a difference 
 No way 
 Ooh, let's call in an angel 
 Ooh, let's call in an angel 
 Ooh, let's call in an angel 
 'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 I'm not trying to make a difference 
 I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 No way 
 'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 I'm not trying to make a difference 
 I'll stop trying to make a difference 
 No way, no way 
 Let's call me an angel 
 Who's calling me an angel?They're buildin' the gallows outside my cell 
 I got 25 minutes to go 
 And in 25 minutes I'll be in Hell 
 I got 24 minutes to go 
 Well, they give me some beans for my last meal 
 23 Minutes to go 
 And you know... nobody asked me how I feel 
 I got 22 minutes to go 
 So, I wrote to the Governor... the whole damned bunch 
 Ah... 21 minutes to go 
 And I call up the Mayor, and you know he's out to lunch 
 I got 20 more minutes to go 
 Well, the Sheriff says, "Boy, I wanna watch you die" 
 With 19 Minutes to go 
 So I spit in his face... and I kick him in the eye 
 I got 18 minutes to go 
 Well... I call out to the Warden to take my plea 
 With 17 Minute to go 
 He says, "Call me back in a week or three 
 You've got 16 minutes to go." 
 Well, my lawyer says he's sorry that he missed my case 
 Oh... 15 minutes to go 
 Well if you're so sorry, come up and take my place 
 With 14 minutes to go 
 Well, now here comes the padre he's gonna set me free 
 With 13 minutes to go 
 And he's talkin'about burnin', well I feel so fucking cold 
 I got 12 more minutes to go 
 Now they're testin'the trap. It chills my spine 
 I got 11 minutes to go 
 'Cause the goddamned thing seems to work just fine 
 I got 10 more minutes to go 
 I'm waitin'for the pardon... gonna set me free 
 With 9 more minutes to go 
 But this ain't the movies, so to hell with me 
 With 8 more minutes to go 
 Now I'm climbin up the ladder with a scaffold peg 
 With 7 more minutes to go 
 I've better watch my step or I'll break my leg 
 I got 6 more minutes to go 
 Yeah... with my feet on the trap and my head in the noose... 
 I got 5 more minutes to go 
 Well, c'mon someone and cut me loose 
 I got 4 more minutes to go 
 I can see the mountains. I can see the sky 
 With 3 more minutes to go 
 And it's too damned pretty for a man to wanna die 
 With 2 more minutes to go 
 I can hear the buzzards... and I see the crows 
 With 1 More minute to go 
 And now I'm swingin'and here I gooooooooo...A man lies in his bed in a room with no door. 
 He waits hoping for a presence, something, anything, to enter. 
 After spending half his life searching, he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he stared. 
 He is alive, but feels absolutely nothing. 
 So is he? 
 When he was six, he believed that the moon over head followed him. 
 By nine, he had deciphered the allusion, trading magic for fact. 
 No trade backs. 
 So this is what it's like to be an adult. 
 If he only knew now what he knew then. 
 I'm open. 
 I'm open. 
 Come on in, come on in. 
 Come on in, come on in. 
 I'm open. 
 I'm open. 
 Come on in, come on in. 
 Come on in, come on in. 
 Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets with no covers. 
 He decides to dream, dream up a new self for himself.If I ever were to lose you 
 I'd surely lose myself 
 Everything I have found, dear 
 I've not found by myself 
 Try and sometimes you'll succeed 
 To make this man of me 
 All my stolen missing parts 
 I've no need for anymore 
 I believe 
 And I believe 'cause I can see 
 Our future days 
 Days of you and me 
 Back when I was feeling broken 
 I focused on a prayer 
 You came deep as any ocean 
 Did something out there hear? 
 All the complexities and games 
 No one wins but somehow they're still played 
 All the missing crooked hearts 
 They may die but in us they live on 
 I believe 
 And I believe 'cause I can see 
 Our future days 
 Days of you and me 
 When hurricanes and cyclones raged 
 When wind turned dirt to dust 
 When floods they came or tides they raised 
 Ever closer became us 
 All the promises at sundown 
 I've meant them like the rest 
 All the demons used to come 'round 
 I'm grateful now they've left 
 So persistent in my ways 
 Hey angel, I am here to stay 
 No resistance, no alarms 
 Please, this is just too good to be gone 
 I believe 
 And I believe 'cause I can see 
 Our future days 
 Days of you and me 
 You and me 
 Days 
 You and meDon't even think about reachin' me, I won't be home 
 Don't even think about stoppin' by, don't think of me at all 
 I did, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you... 
 Ah... don't even think about gettin' inside 
 Voices in me head... ooh, voices 
 I got scratches, all over my arms 
 One for each day, since I fell apart 
 I did... oh, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you 
 Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you... oh... 
 Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you... 
 Hey... I did, what I had to do... oh, and if there was a reason 
 Oh, there wasn't no reason, no 
 And if, there's something you'd like to do 
 Just let me continue, to blame you 
 Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you... oh... 
 Pictures on my chest, it was you, you... oh...Oh, he deals them off, off the top, ties them off 
 Fills it up with his past, gets carried away 
 Oh, half his life, a hand-me-down, wasted away 
 Oh, he fills it up with the love of a girl 
 Oh, he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy 
 How he makes his getaway 
 How he makes his getaway 
 Oh, he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four 
 Fills his mind with the thought of a girl 
 How he makes his getaway 
 How he makes his getaway 
 How he makes his getaway 
 GetawayWhat were all those dreams we shared those many years ago? 
 What were all those plans we made now left beside the road? 
 Behind us in the road 
 More than friends, I always pledged 'cause friends, they come and go 
 People change as does everything, I wanted to grow old 
 Just want to grow old 
 Slide on next to me, I’m just a human being 
 I will take the blame but just the same, this is not me 
 You see, believe 
 I’m better than this 
 Don’t leave me so cold, I'm buried beneath the stones 
 I just want to hold on and know I’m worth your love 
 Enough, I don’t think 
 There’s such a thing 
 It’s my fault, now I've been caught a sickness in my bones 
 How it pains to leave you here with the kids on your own 
 Just don’t let me go 
 Help me see myself, 'cause I can no longer tell 
 Looking up from the inside of the bottom of a well 
 It’s Hell, I yell, but no one hears 
 Before I disappear, whisper in my ear 
 Give me something to echo in my unknown future's ear 
 My dear, the end comes near 
 I’m here, but not much longerPower high, power low 
 You can take 'em all to school 
 You can fly, wilt the stilt had nothing on you 
 Lambchops and afro-do, milwaukee bucks and a barbecue 
 #33 just like you 
 Sweet lew, how could you? 
 Sweet lew, makin' me blue 
 A laker trade their bobby-d for a house, a crew by the sea 
 A little help from 32, showtime, and worthy 
 Those were the days, pre-investment spree 
 Sweet lew, is it true? 
 Sweet lew, how could you? 
 I grew up trying to copy you, bruce lee, and a kung-fu 
 Acta jazzman, yogi too 
 Little did I know, a loose screw 
 But you had your own shoe 
 Build him high, build him tall, a taiku with a basketball 
 Tear 'em down, one and all 
 7'2" is a long way to fall 
 Sweet lew, how's the view? 
 Sweet lew, how could you?When the kingdom comes 
 He puts his records on 
 And with his blistered thumb hits play 
 And with the volume up 
 He goes and fills his cup 
 And lets the drummer's drum take away the pain 
 The pain 
 Breaking, forsaken 
 What's that you're taking? 
 Aaw, needing the feeling 
 He lets the records play 
 Should the future dim 
 A cigarette lights hymn 
 Vaporized a green light grin 
 And when the shotglass talks 
 He knows to listen up 
 Until he's nice and numb again 
 Again, again 
 Shakened, awakened 
 Not one for faking 
 The kneeling, his healing 
 He lets the records play 
 There's wisdom in his ways 
 I been down and I fell so hard and far from grace 
 I been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face 
 I been off, but I'm on, up above my feet, my feet again 
 Eh 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey, hey 
 Shaken, foresaken 
 What's that your taking? 
 Aaw, needing the feeling 
 He lets the records play 
 Shakened, awakened 
 Not one for faking 
 The kneeling, his healing 
 He lets the records play 
 Oh, there's wisdom in his ways 
 Ow 
 Get on with it, boy 
 Faster, little fasterLight green to green, dark green, brown 
 Every life is falling down 
 Brown to black, it's coming back 
 Dies to be part of the ground 
 Seed to seedling, root to stem 
 Eyes, no eyes, there's no difference 
 Every life is looking in 
 Swallowing seeds on the deathbed 
 Dig a hole in the garden 
 Everyone is practicing 
 But this world's an accident 
 I was the fool because I thought 
 I thought the world 
 Turns out the world thought me 
 It's all the other way around 
 We're upside down 
 Dad, he's gone up in flames 
 But this ain't no movie 
 This ain't no book you can close 
 When the big lie hits your eye 
 Everyone is practicing 
 Our world's an accident 
 I was the fool because I thought 
 I thought the world 
 Turns out the world thought me 
 It's all the other way 'round 
 We're upside down 
 Down, down, down 
 Let the fluency set it down 
 Down 
 Let the fluency set it down 
 There's an upside of down 
 The moon is rolling 'round our world 
 The moon is rolling 'round our world 
 Our world 
 Our worldIt's out of my hands making your hands meet 
 Stumble as it's crumbling out of reach 
 It's in the cards of destiny your sanity in tow 
 Designate my luck 
 Uh, resignate 
 This power has no roots to guide, no role 
 Trust me, rusted minds refuse to go 
 Unwillingness is meaningless to walk away in vain 
 Designate my will 
 Ah, designate my fill 
 Ah, resignate 
 My will is crashing, synapses flashing slow 
 Ah, days like frame by frame, where do they go? 
 Ah yeah, why fight? Forget it, cannot spend it after I go 
 Roll them high 
 Throw them again 
 All gods' dice 
 Monkey driven, call this the living? Ha. 
 Ah, too much thought it's overwrought a hole 
 Yeah, minding yours what's mine not yours 
 Will finish us off 
 Ah, designate my life 
 Ah, designate my view 
 Ah, resignate my will, my will, my will, I will 
 Resignate my GodSomeday at christmas men won't be boys 
 Playing with bombs like kids play with toys 
 One warm December our hearts will see 
 A world where men are free 
 Someday at christmas there'll be no war 
 When we have learned what christmas is for 
 When we have found what life's really worth 
 There'll be peace on earth 
 Someday all our dreams will come to be 
 Someday in a world where men are free 
 Maybe not in time for you and me 
 But someday at christmas time 
 Someday at christmas we'll see a land 
 With no hungry children 
 No emtpy hand 
 One happy morning people will share 
 A world where people care 
 Someday at christmas 
 There'll be no tears 
 When all men are equal 
 No man has fears 
 One shining moment 
 One prayer away 
 From our world today 
 Someday all our dreams will come to be 
 Someday in a world where men are free 
 Maybe not in time for you and me 
 But someday at christmas time 
 Someday at christmas 
 Men will not fail 
 Hate will be gone 
 And love will prevail 
 Someday a new world 
 That we can start 
 With hope in every heart 
 Someday at christmas 
 Someday at christmas time (2x)Give me, give me, what I really need (2x) 
 Hold me, hold me, hold me in my sleep 
 Give me, give me, what I really need

 Spread out what begins my Hell, there's nothing left in our way 
 Give me, give me, give me what I need 
 Oh, give me, oh hold me, oh treat me for today 
 What I'm talking about (2x) 
 Is just the kind of things, of the doubt 
 Give me, give me, give me...

 Shaft of a light. A warm breath and a scream. 
 Ah, yeah.

 Oh, can't expect to go out, to go out with anything, anything more. 
 Oh reach the door. A breath and a...

 Whoa. I suggest you step out on your porch. 
 Oh yeah. Huh. huh. Huh huh, yeah. 
 Run away my son. See it all. Oh see the world. 
 Oh reach the door. A breath and a... 
 Oh reach the door. Oha and a la la la la yeah. 
 Life ain't what it's worth. 
 A breath and a... Oh reach the door. 
 Come. Here it comes. There it goes. When it comes. 
 Where it goes. Where it comes. 
 Can't see through the faith. Whoa. 
 Ooh. Come. Here it comes. There it goes. 
 Grasp what you can. 
 Don't you know there's something inside your head, yeah. 
 Oh, if I knew where it was I would take you there but there's much more 
 Than this. 
 Ooh. Whoa, much more than this. Woh see the world. Much more than... 
 Oh, much more than. Why?I had a false belief; I thought I came here to stay. 
 We're all just visiting, all just breaking like waves. 
 The oceans made me, but who came up with love? 
 Push me, pull me, push me, but pull me out. 
 So if there were no angels would there be no sin? 
 You better stop me before I begin. 
 But let me say: 
 If I behave, can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground? 
 Somewhere nice, make it nice 
 Where the land meets high tide. 
 Push me, pull me, or pull me out. 
 Like a cloud dropping rain I'm discarding all thought. 
 I'll dry up leaving puddles on the ground. 
 I'm like an opening band for the sun. 
 Push me, pull me, or just pull me out out out ... 
 I've had enough, said enough, felt enough, I'm fine.I admit it -- what's to say? Yeah 
 I'll relive it without pain 
 Backstreet lover on the side of the road 
 I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode 
 I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes 
 I play 
 Once upon a time, I could control myself 
 Ooh, once upon a time, I could lose myself, yeah 
 Oh, try and mimic what's insane, ooh 
 I am in it, where do I stand? 
 Oh, indian summer and I hate the heat 
 I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat 
 I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet 
 I pray 
 Once upon a time I could control myself 
 Ooh, once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah, yeah 
 You think I got my eyes closed 
 But I'm lookin' at you the whole fuckin' time 
 Ooh, once upon a time I could control myself, yeah 
 Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Once, upon a time I could love myself, yeah 
 Once upon a time I could love you, yeah 
 Once, once, once, once 
 Yeah, once, once, yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahThe mind is gray like the city 
 Packing in and overgrown 
 Love is deep, dig it out 
 Standing in a hole alone 
 Working for something 
 That one can never hold 
 A place in the clouds 
 Good place to hide, oh my oh 
 So I'm flying away, away 
 Driving away, away 
 Finding hope in ways I missed before 
 I missed before 
 The TV, she talks to me 
 Breaking news and building walls 
 Selling me what I don't need 
 I never knew soap made you taller 
 So I'm gliding away, away 
 Hiding away, away 
 So much talk it makes no sense at all 
 My senses have gone, AWOL, AWOL, AWOL, AWOL, AWOL 
 So I'm hiding away, away 
 Driving away, away 
 Passing new friends I won't know at all 
 Won't know at all 
 It doesn't hurt when I bleed 
 But my memories they eat me 
 I've seen it all before 
 Bring it on, 'cause I'm no victim 
 Dying 
 (away, away) 
 Dying 
 (away, away) 
 Dying 
 DyingI wanna shake 
 I wanna wind out 
 I wanna leave 
 This mind and shout 
 I've lived 
 All this life 
 Like an ocean 
 In disguise 
 I don't live forever 
 You can't keep me here 
 I wanna race 
 With the sundown 
 I want a last breath 
 I don't let out 
 Forgive 
 Every being 
 The bad feelings 
 It's just me 
 I won't wait for answers 
 You can't keep me here 
 I wanna rise 
 And say goodnight 
 I Wanna take 
 A look on the other side 
 I've lived 
 All this life 
 It's been wonder 
 Full at night 
 I will live for ever 
 You can't keep me hereTidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their way 
 Father he enjoyed collisions, others walked away 
 A snowflake falls in may 
 And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out 
 'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for now 
 Nature has its own religion, gospel from the land 
 Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend 
 Old men comprehend. 
 And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'round 
 Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for now 
 And the road the old man paved 
 The broken seams along the way 
 The rusted signs, left just for me 
 He was guiding me, Love, his own way 
 Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow 
 As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for nowYou'll be... 
 Going out with radio. 
 Going out with disco. 
 Going out like bacchanal. 
 I'll be... 
 Going out with telephone 
 Going out alone. 
 To the radar zone. 
 It's all just inadvertent imitation, 
 And I don't mean mine. 
 It's all across this nation. 
 If it's just inadverdent simulation, 
 A pattern in all mankind, 
 What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
 I'll be... 
 Playing with my magazine. 
 Using up my Listerine. 
 Like Ovaltine. 
 And you'll be... 
 Dipping in your battleship. 
 For the latest tip. 
 For the latest dream. 
 It's all just inadvertent imitation, 
 And I don't mean mine. 
 It's all across this nation. 
 If it's just inadverdent simulation, 
 A pattern in all mankind, 
 What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
 If it's just inadvertent imitation, 
 A pattern in all mankind, 
 What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
 What's got the whole world fakin'? 
 What's got the whole world fakin'? 
 What's got the whole world fakin'? 
 What's got the whole world fakin'? 
 What's got the whole world fakin'? 
 What's got the whole world fakin' it, yeah?Said a-don't worry 'bout a thing... worry 'bout a thing now... 
 Every little thing is gonna be all right... all right... 
 Said a-don't worry 'bout a thing... 
 Every little thing is gonna be all right... all right... 
 Woke up this mornin', cried with the rising sun 
 Three little birds were on my doorstep 
 Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and smooth 
 Singin', 'this is a message to you' 
 I said a-don't worry about a thing... worry 'bout a thing now... 
 Every little thing's gonna be all right... all right... 
 Said a don't worry about a thing... worry 'bout a thing now... 
 Every little thing, yeah, is gonna be all right... all right... yeah...We're all crazy 
 We're all crazy and we're --

 We're all crazy 
 We're all crazy and we're --How good is he? 
 How warm are his eyes 
 You'll see it's not a reprise 
 There he arrived 
 Too late and too tethered away 
 To put on his suit and his tie 
 How good is he? 
 How warm is his heart 
 Or ego telling him which place to park 
 Did he relate, the message is clearly hardly 
 Grounds for dismissal outright 
 Grounds for dismissal outright 
 I wake up and wait up 
 When anger's in fashion 
 I wake up and wait up 
 It echoes through the mansions 
 I wake up and wait up 
 When April's in may, oh uh oh 
 I wake up and wait up 
 The answers are fatal 
 The answers are fatal 
 When I wait up and wake up 
 The answers are fatal 
 If he's truly out of sight 
 Is he truly out of mind? 
 If he's truly out of sight.Pirates, I'm sayin' they rob I 
 Board the merchant ships 
 I'm not sayin' we're not a part of it 
 From the bottomless pit 
 But my hands were made strong 
 By the force of the Almighty 
 They don't say that your generation, triumphantly 
 Won't you help to sing 
 These songs of freedom 
 'Cause all I ever had 
 Redemption song 
 Emancipate yourself from mental slavery 
 None but ourselves can free our mind 
 Have no fear for atomic energy 
 'Cause none of them can stop the time 
 How long can they steal our prophets 
 While we stand beside and look? 
 They don't say I'm your generation 
 Oh, and I say... 
 Won't you help to sing 
 These songs of freedom 
 'Cause all I ever had 
 Redemption song (x2) 
 Emancipate yourself from mental slavery 
 None but ourselves can free our mind 
 Have no fear for atomic energy 
 'Cause none of them can stop the time 
 How long can they steal our prophets 
 While we stand beside and look? 
 Say some say it's just a part of it 
 You got to fulfill the book... 
 Won't you help to sing 
 These songs of freedom 
 'Cause all I ever had 
 Redemption song 
 'Cause all I ever had 
 Redemption song (X2) 
 This song of freedom 
 Oh...This broken wheel is coming undone 
 And the road's exploding 
 But you're keeping me strong 
 Rolling along with you 
 Love is a tower 
 And you're the key 
 Leading me higher 
 When you let me in 
 Keeping us close, so close 
 On down the line 
 Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun 
 With no one knowing 
 But you're keeping me strong 
 Moving along with you 
 You are a tower of 
 Strength to me 
 The darkening hour 
 Sees light again 
 Ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah 
 You are, you are, you are, you are 
 Love is a tower 
 Of strength to me 
 I am the shoreline 
 But you're the sea 
 You are 
 You are 
 You are 
 You are 
 You 
 You are 
 You are 
 You areI have faced it 
 A life wasted 
 I'm never going back again 
 Having tasted 
 A life wasted 
 I'm never going back again 
 I escaped it 
 A life wasted 
 I'm never going back againDown. Fall by the wayside no getting out. 
 Down. Cry me a river dried up and dammed. 
 The names can be changed but the place is still the same. 
 I am loaded. Told that all's for naught. Holds me down. 
 Rise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line. 
 Rise. You can't be neutral on a moving train. 
 One day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away. 
 And if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done. 
 Won't let the light escape from me. 
 Won't let the darkness swallow me. 
 So long.Sliding out of reverse into drive, this 
 Wheel will be turning right, then straight 
 Off in the sunset she'll ride 
 She can remember a time denied 
 Stood by the side of the road, spilled like wine now 
 She's out on her own and I'm high 
 There's no leaving here 
 Ask- I'm an ear 
 She's disappeared 
 They said that timing was everything 
 Made him want to be everywhere 
 There's a lot to be said for nowhere 
 There's no leaving here 
 Ask- I'm an ear 
 He's disappeared 
 There's no leaving here 
 Ask- I'm an ear 
 Fuck it- we've disappearedAt home, drawing pictures 
 Of mountaintops 
 With him on top 
 Lemon yellow sun 
 Arms raised in a V 
 And the dead lay 
 In pools of maroon below 
 Daddy didn't give attention 
 Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care 
 King Jeremy the Wicked 
 Oh, ruled his world 
 Jeremy spoke in class today 
 Jeremy spoke in class today 
 Clearly I remember 
 Picking on the boy 
 Seemed a harmless little fuck 
 Ooh, but we unleashed a lion 
 Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast 
 How could I forget? 
 And he hit me with a surprise left 
 My jaw left hurting 
 Ooh, dropped wide open 
 Just like the day 
 Oh, like the day I heard 
 Daddy didn't give affection, no 
 And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear 
 King Jeremy the Wicked 
 Oh, ruled his world 
 Jeremy spoke in class today 
 Jeremy spoke in class today 
 Jeremy spoke in class today

 Driftin away 
 I got myself a mansion 
 And I gave it away 
 It's not the world that's heavy 
 It's just the friends that you save 
 But I'm driftin 
 Driftin away 
 Driftin 
 Driftin 
 Driftin along 
 I rid myself of worries 
 And the worries were gone 
 I can run when I want to 
 And I sleep like a dog 
 I'm just driftin 
 Driftin along 
 The suit-coats say 
 There is money to be made 
 They get so damn excited 
 But I guess it's their way 
 My road it may be lonely 
 Just because it's not paved 
 It's good for driftin 
 Driftin away 
 Aw the suit-coats say 
 There is money to be made 
 They get so damn excited 
 Nothing gets in their way 
 My road it may be lonely 
 Just because it's not paved 
 It's good for driftin 
 Driftin away 
 Driftin 
 Driftin 
 Driftin uh-huh 
 I feel like going back there 
 But never for long 
 I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone 
 I'm just driftin 
 Driftin along

 Driftin along 
 Driftin 
 DriftinNow all the Sundays seem so blue 
 Just a changing week it is to blame 
 Don't wanna open any wounds 
 I just want to laugh again 
 Don't feel the Christmas without you 
 All the lights have turned to gray 
 The rain upon the passing cars 
 Blurs your smile 
 Was it worth it? 
 I was gone so long (In the long run) 
 You deserve peace 
 Cause giving love is strong (In the long run) 
 Was it worth it in the long run? 
 All the sunshine of your smile 
 Has been turning in the mist 
 Of my eyes 
 Tell me, are you leaving 
 Feel all lies 
 Was it worth it? 
 I was gone so long (In the long run) 
 You deserve peace 
 Cause giving love is strong (In the long run) 
 Was it worth it in the long run? 
 In the long run 
 In the long runIt's five below in evidence. 
 The winded eves and sideways snow. 
 His eminence has yet to show. 
 Follow the ageless tide. 
 Follow the angled light. 
 Follow the strangest tribe. 
 It's 6:00 AM. You're waiting for... 
 You've had your feast. 
 You're wanting more. 
 Follow the wayward mile. 
 Follow the distant high. 
 Follow the strangest tribe. 
 Follow the ancient stripe. 
 Follow the angels try. 
 Follow the strangest tribe.Well, I dated your big sister 
 And took her to a show 
 I went for some candy 
 Along came jim dandy 
 And they snuck right out of the door 
 Ev'ry time I see your sister 
 Well she's got somebody new 
 She's mean and she's evil 
 Like that old boll weevil 
 Guess I'll try my luck with you 
 Well, I used to pull your pigtails 
 And pinch your turned-up nose 
 But you been a growin' 
 And baby, it's been showin' 
 From your head down to your toes 
 Little sister, don't you 
 Little sister, don't you 
 Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice 
 Then say it's very nice 
 And then you run 
 Little sister, don't you 
 Do what your big sister doneThey don't eat, don't sleep 
 They don't feed, they don't seethe 
 Bare their gums when they moan and squeak 
 Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet 
 They don't push, don't crowd 
 Congregate until they're much too loud 
 Fuck to procreate till they are dead 
 Drink the blood of their so-called best friend 
 They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way 
 Don't pack themselves together and run as one 
 Don't shit where they're not supposed to 
 Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare 
 They don't scam, don't fight 
 Don't oppress an equal's given rights 
 Starve the poor so they can be well-fed 
 Line their holes with the dead one's bread 
 They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way 
 Don't pack themselves together and run as one 
 Don't shit where they're not supposed to 
 Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare 
 They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way 
 Don't pack themselves together and run as one 
 Don't shit where they're not supposed to 
 Don't take what's not theirs 
 They don't compare 
 Rats, they don't compare 
 Rats, they don't compare 
 Ben, the two of us need look no more 
 Ben, the two of us need look no more 
 Ben, the two of us need look no more 
 Ben, the two of us need look no more 
 Ben, the two of us need look no more 
 Ben, the two of us need look no moreThe selfish, they're all standing in line 
 Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time 
 Me, I figure as each breath goes by 
 I only own my mind 
 The north is to south what the clock is to time 
 There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life 
 I know I was born and I know that I'll die 
 The in-between is mine 
 I am mine 
 And the feeling, it gets left behind 
 All the innocence lost at one time 
 Significant behind the eyes 
 There's no need to hide 
 We're safe tonight 
 The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying 
 The full moon is looking for friends at high tide 
 The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied 
 I only know my mind 
 I am mine 
 And the meaning, it gets left behind 
 All the innocence lost at one time 
 Significant behind the eyes 
 There's no need to hide 
 We're safe tonight, whoa 
 And the feelings that get left behind 
 All the innocence broken with lies 
 Significance between the lines 
 We may need to hide 
 And the meanings that get left behind 
 All the innocence lost at one time 
 We're all different behind the eyes 
 There's no need to hideIt's the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch the blood 
 Flowin out of the bullet hole in his head 
 It's the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch TV 
 See on the news, listen to what the man said. 
 He said: ask not what you can do for your country. 
 What's your country been doing to you? 
 Ask not what what you can do for your country. 
 What's your country been doing to your mind? 
 It's the Amerikan in me 
 Says it an honor to die 
 In a war that's just some politician's lie. 
 It's the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch TV 
 See how they burned the SLA, they said 
 Ask not what what you can do for your country. 
 What's your country been doing to you? 
 Ask not what what you can do for your country. 
 What's your country been doing to you? 
 In the USA 
 In the USA 
 It's the Amerikan in me 
 That makes me watch the blood 
 Flowin out of the bullet hole in his head 
 It's the Amerikan in me 
 That never wonders why 
 Kennedy was murdered by the FBI 
 Ask not...I am wishing you a well. 
 Mind at peace within your cell. 
 Covers up, I cast you off. 
 I'll be watching as you breathe. 
 I lie still, you move, I send you off around the bend. 
 I hold your head deep in my arms. 
 My fingertips, they close your eyes. 
 Off you dream, my little child. 
 There's a sun around the bend. 
 There's a sun around the bend. 
 All the evenings close like this. 
 All these moments that I've missed. 
 Please forgive me, won't you, dear? 
 Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend... 
 You're an angel when you sleep. 
 How I want your soul to keep on and on around the bend.You fool 
 Dude what d'you think you're doing 
 So you're lost 
 My problem is not 
 Conductor says 
 Off of my train 
 Be understood 
 Guess those relationships ain't my thing 
 Even if I could 
 You ain't the kinda person I would help anyway 
 I'm about to explode 
 'Cause I can't carry your load 
 Hitchhiker 
 You're cool 
 And coke and your calculations 
 We're friends 
 Only because of my situation 
 I'm about to unload 
 'Cause I can't carry your load 
 Hitchhiker 
 So be gone 
 Too soon is too late 
 I want no delay 
 So be gone 
 Get your food of someone else's plate 
 Go tell all o'your friends 
 I'm an idiot and you're great 
 Hitchhiker 
 Now Go...She looked at me with dignity said 
 "There's one thing you gotta see if you know we're headed for war 
 This country's prouder than ever before 
 Yes there's a spirit in the air, we're more American than anywhere" 
 Well I just smiled 'cause I could tell this little girl's going to hell 
 Now I wouldn't mind if you swallowed my pride 
 Would make me feel all right, deep inside, feel all right 
 All the warmth in her heart can't keep my blood from running cold 
 Keep my blood from running cold 
 First I fell for her looks, now I just wanna go for the throat 
 I tried to tell her a hundred times, this little girl didn't understand at all 
 Pride comes before a fall 
 Now I wouldn't mind if you swallowed my pride 
 Make me feel all right, deep inside, feel all right

 All right bye see yaBig man stands behind an open door 
 Said, 
 "Leave your lady on the cement floor." 
 Got some kicks, want to take a ride? 
 I said, yeah! 
 Take your pick, leave yourself behind 
 I said, yeah! 
 I've no fear but for falling down 
 So look out below I am falling now 
 Oh please understand, I just need my friend 
 A way, a way, a way home 
 Tried to walk, found a severed hand 
 Recognized it from the wedding band 
 Said it's okay, do you want some more? 
 I said, yeah! 
 You'll see dragons after three or four 
 I said, yeah! 
 Understand I'm not falling down 
 I said, look around, the rooms taller now 
 I can't close my eyes, 'cause I see the sound 
 In waves, in waves, lets me stay calm 
 If I don't lose control 
 Explore and not explode 
 A preternatural other plane 
 With the power to maintain 
 Like a tear in all we know 
 Once dissolved we are free to grow 
 What is human, what is more? 
 I'll answer this when I get homeI don't need anyone, don't need no mom and dad 
 Don't need no good advice, don't need no human rights 
 I got some news for you, don't even need you too 
 I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream 
 Sonic reducer, ain't no loser... oh... 
 Got a sonic reducer, sonic reducer... 
 People out on the streets, they don't know who I am 
 I watch them from my room, they are just passing by 
 I'm not just anyone, said I'm not just anyone 
 I got my time machine, got my little 'lectronic dream 
 Sonic reducer, ain't no loser... oh... 
 Sonic reducer, sonic reducer... ah... 
 I'll be your bearer soon, love on some cotton doom 
 Things will be different then, the sun will rise from here 
 Then I'll be ten feet tall, then you'll be nothing at all 
 I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream 
 Sonic reducer, ain't no loser... oh... 
 Sonic reducer, sonic reducer... oh... 
 Sonic reducer, sonic reducer... yeah... 
 Sonic reducer, sonic reducer, sonic reducer... oh...Wise men say, "Only fools rush in." 
 But I can't help falling in love with you. 
 Until I stay. Would it be a sin? 
 If I can't help falling in love with you. 
 Like a river flows surely to the sea. 
 Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be. 
 Oh take my hand. Take my whole life too. 
 Because I can't help falling in love with you. 
 And I can't help falling in love with you.She nursed him there over a night 
 I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay 
 What to say? What to say? 
 But soon she was down, soon he was low 
 At a quarter past, a holy no 
 She had to turn around 
 When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded 
 A dissident is here 
 Escape is never the safest path 
 Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here 
 And to this day, she's glided on 
 Always home but so far away, like a word misplaced 
 Nothing said, what a waste 
 But when she had contact with the conflict 
 There was meaning but she sold him to the state 
 She had to turn around 
 When she couldn't hold, she folded 
 A dissident is here 
 Escape is never the safest path 
 Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 She gave him away when she couldn't hold 
 No, she folded 
 A dissident is here 
 Escape is never the safest path 
 Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here 
 Oh, couldn't hold on 
 She couldn't hold, no, she folded 
 A dissident is here 
 Escape is never the safest place 
 Oh, a dissident is hereTrouble, oh trouble set me free 
 I have seen your face and it's too much for me today 
 Trouble, oh trouble can't you see 
 You're eating my heart away, and theirs nothing much left of me 
 I've drunk your wine 
 You have made your world mine 
 So won't you be fair 
 Oh won't you be fair 
 I don't want no more of you 
 So won't you be kind to me 
 And let me go there 
 I have to go there 
 Trouble, oh trouble move away 
 I have seen your face and it's too much for me today 
 Trouble, oh trouble can't you see 
 You have made me a wreck, now wont you leave me in my misery 
 I've seen your eyes 
 And I have seen deaths disguise, oh hanging on me 
 Oh hanging on me 
 I'm deep and torn 
 I'm shattered and lost and worn 
 So shocking to see 
 Too shocking to see 
 Trouble, oh trouble please be kind

 Don't give me no lip

 Don't give me no lip, I've lost my taste for it 
 Don't give me no lip, you've got to face this shit 
 Don't give me no lip, Don't give me no lip 
 Don't give me no lip

 Don't give me no lip, Don't give me no lip 
 It's just a problem 
 One I'll be solving 
 It's just a problem 
 Don't give me no lip 
 Don't give me no lip 
 Don't give me no 
 4xThere are colors on the street, red, white and blue 
 People shufflin' their feet, people sleepin' in their shoes 
 But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead 
 There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead 
 Don't feel like Satan but I'm to them 
 So I try to forget it anyway I can 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand 
 Under an old street light near a garbage can 
 Now, she's put the kid away and she's gone to get a hit 
 She hates her life and what she's done to it 
 That's one more kid that'll never go to school 
 Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man 
 We got a kindler, gentler, machine gun hand 
 We've got department stores and toilet paper 
 Got styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer 
 Got a man of the people says keep hope alive 
 Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free world 
 Keep on rockin' in the free worldIt's a hopeless situation 
 And I'm starting to believe 
 That this hopeless situation 
 Is what I'm trying to achieve 
 But I try to run on 
 It's all or none 
 All or none 
 All or none 
 Here's the selfless confession 
 Leading me back to war 
 Can we help that our destinations 
 Are the ones we've been before? 
 I still try to run on 
 But it's all or none 
 All or none 
 All or none 
 To myself I surrender 
 To the one I'll never please 
 But I still try to run on 
 You know, I still try to run on 
 But it's all or none 
 All or noneTell me what I wanna hear 
 This shit's too good to be true 
 My dear 
 Tell me lies 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Storybook keeps from hurting me 
 You see 
 Shell of the man from the sea 
 Tell me lies 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Tell me why 
 Tell me why, tell me 
 Tell me why, tell me 
 Tell me lies 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Tell me lies, tell me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Reservoir of hate and fear 
 Invisible, in repair 
 A hundred thieves cast a spell 
 This is hell 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes 
 He looks just like me, a mirror 
 The more you read, we've been deceived 
 Everyday it becomes clearer 
 Clearer, clearer 
 Clearer, clearer 
 Clearer, clearer 
 Not my enemy 
 No, not my enemy 
 Don't speak for me 
 No, not my enemySo bye, bye Miss American Pie 
 Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry 
 Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
 Singin' this'll be the day that I die... 
 This'll be the day that I die...I seem to recognize your face 
 Haunting, familiar, yet I can't seem to place it 
 Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name 
 Lifetimes are catching up with me 
 All these changes taking place 
 I wish I'd seen the place 
 But no one's ever taken me 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 I swear I recognize your breath 
 Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising 
 Me, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former 
 It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf 
 I changed by not changing at all 
 Small town predicts my fate 
 Perhaps that's what no one wants to see 
 I just want to scream hello 
 My God, it's been so long 
 Never dreamed you'd return 
 But now here you are and here I am 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away 
 Hearts and thoughts, they fadeMy lips are shaking, my nails are bit off 
 Been a month since I've heard myself talk 
 All the advantage this life's got on me 
 Picture a cup in the middle of the sea 
 And I fight back in my mind 
 Never lets me be right, oh 
 I got memories, I got shit 
 So much it don't show 
 I walked the line 
 When you held me in that night 
 I walked the line 
 When you held my hand that night 
 An empty shell seems so easy to crack 
 Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask 
 So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream 
 Where I'm not ugly and you're looking at me 
 And I'll stay in a bed 
 Oh could've seen it 
 If just once, I could feel loved 
 Oh, stare back at me, yeah 
 But I walked the line 
 When you held me in that night 
 Oh, I walked the line 
 When you held my hand that night 
 Oh, I walked the line 
 When you held me close at night 
 I paid the price, never held you in real lifeShe was an evil little goat, goat, goat...

 Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech. 
 As he opens the door, she rolls over, pretends to sleep as he looks her over. 
 She lies and says she's in love with him. 
 Can't find a better man. 
 She dreams in color, she dreams in red. 
 Can't find a better man. 
 Can't find a better man. 
 Can't find a better man. 
 Oh... 
 Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know... 
 She tells herself, oh... 
 Memories back when she was smooth and strong, and waiting for the world to come along. 
 Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone. 
 And she swears he's cool. 
 She lies and says she's in love with him. 
 Can't find a better man. 
 She dreams in color, she dreams in red.

 She lies and says she still loves him.

 In an underwater nation, yeah 
 And I surf in celebration, oh 
 Of a billion adaptations, yeah yeah 
 Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave 
 Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave 
 I feel the need planted in me 
 Millions of years ago 
 Can't you see the ocean's size? 
 Defining time and tide arising 
 Arms laid upon me 
 Being so kind to let me ride 
 I scream in affirmation, oh 
 Of connecting dislocations, yeah 
 And exceeding limitation, oh 
 By achieving levitation, yeah 
 Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave

 OhThere must be some kind of way out of here 
 Said the joker to the thief 
 There's too much confusion 
 I can't get no relief 
 Businessmen they drink my wine 
 Plow men dig my earth 
 None will level on the line 
 Nobody of it is worth 
 Hey Hey 
 No reason to get excited 
 The thief he kindly spoke 
 There are many here among us 
 Who feel that life is but a fucking joke but, uh 
 But you and I we've been through that 
 And this is not our fate 
 So let us not talk falsely now 
 The hour's getting late 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Bare-foot servants to, but, Uh 
 Outside in the cold distance 
 A wild cat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 And the wind began to howl 
 Hey 
 Oh 
 All along the watchtower 
 Hear you sing around the watch 
 Gotta beware gotta beware I will 
 Yeah 
 Ooh baby 
 All along the watchtowerWhat used to be a house of cards 
 Has turned into a reservoir 
 Saved the tears that were waterfalling 
 Let's go swim tonight, darling 
 And once outside the undertow 
 Just you and me and nothing more 
 If not for love I would be drowning 
 I've seen it work both ways, but I am up 
 Riding high amongst the waves 
 I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved 
 I can feel like I've put away my early grave 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late 
 Remember back the early days 
 When you were young and and thus amazed 
 Suddenly the channel changed 
 The first time you saw blood 
 Cut to later, now you're strong 
 You've bled yourself, the wounds are gone 
 It's rare when there is nothing wrong 
 Survived and you're amongst the fittest 
 Love ain't love until you give it up 
 Up riding high amongst the waves 
 I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved 
 I can see the light coming through the clouds in rays 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late, hey yeah 
 Riding high amongst the waves 
 I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved 
 I can see the light coming through the clouds in rays 
 I gotta say it now better loud than too late 
 I got to say it now better loud than too late 
 Say it now better loud than too late 
 Hey, yeahCan't know what's high 
 Till you been down so low 
 The future's bright 
 Lit up with nowhere to go 
 To and fro the pendulum throws 
 We are here and then we go 
 My shadow left me long ago 
 Understand what we don't know 
 This might pass, this might last, this may grow 
 Easy come and easy go 
 Easy left me a long time ago 
 I'm in the fire, but I'm still cold 
 Nothing works, works for me anymore 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (To and fro the pendulum throws) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (To and fro the pendulum throws) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (to and fro) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (to and fro) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (to and fro)I've got you, and that's all I want. 
 I won't forget, 'cause that's a whole lot. 
 When something's wrong, I feel uneasy. 
 You show me, tell me you're not teasin'. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 Look at you, you're a pageant. 
 You're everything that I've imagined. 
 I don't go out, now that you're here. 
 Sometimes we shout, but that's no problem. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 There's no doubt, but when I'm with you. 
 When I'm without, I stay in my room. 
 Where do you go? I get no answer. 
 You're always out, it gets on my nerves... 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying. 
 I don't know why sometimes I get frightened. 
 You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying.Eí per noi un piacere augurarvi insieme [it is a pleasure for us to wish you, together] 
 Ai r.e.m. un buon cetriolo [with r.e.m., a merry christmas] 
 I need a song to help along 
 When it feels wrong it seems so long 
 To get to the light 
 We live in homes talk on phones 
 Hear the tone can you hold 
 Moving fast as light TV's on at night 
 Does peace come out of fighting? 
 Can truth come out of lying? 
 I'm happy when I'm crying 
 If reality is what I see newspapers magazines TV 
 Tell us what's going on leading us along 
 It's not absurd to all get heard 
 Put our feelings into words 
 You have to reach inside no feelings to hide 
 Does peace come out of fighting? 
 Can truth come out of lying? 
 I'm happy when I'm crying 
 Bring children into the world 
 We couldn't have done it by ourselves 
 Stop and wonder why 
 There's more than meets the eyes 
 Somewhere inside I did believe 
 I can't belong I was wrong 
 I have gained insight 
 I will see the light 
 Truth isn't lying 
 Peace isn't fighting 
 Love isn't dyingI was drawn 
 Riding atop a black horse 
 Whatever past there was 
 I could only observe 
 Where the trouble starts 
 Where does it end? 
 How can I be cured 
 How, before it ends? 
 I know life would be different 
 If I held on, held on 
 I know I could be something 
 If I held on 
 Gave her life away 
 Put it in my pocket when it shoulda been framed 
 Oh, it lost its shine 
 Gotta get this outta my head 
 Out of my bed 
 How could it end 
 End like this? 
 How could it end? 
 I know life would be different 
 Had I held on, held on 
 I know I could be something 
 Had I held on, held on 
 I know I could be something 
 If I held on, held on 
 I know life would be different 
 If I held on, held on 
 Held on, held on 
 If I held on, held on 
 If I held on, held on 
 If I held on, held onSometimes I'm right then I can be wrong 
 My own beliefs are in my songs 
 A butcher, a banker, Jack Irons on drums 
 Makes no difference what group I'm in 
 I am everyday people 
 Then it's the blue ones who can't accept 
 The green ones for living with 
 The black ones tryin' to be a skinny one 
 Different strokes for different folks 
 And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby 
 Ooh sha sha 
 We gotta live together 
 I am no better and neither are you 
 We're all the same whatever we do 
 You love me you hate me 
 You know me and then 
 Still can't figure out the scene I'm in 
 I am everyday people 
 Then it's the new man 
 That doesn't like the short man 
 For being such a rich one 
 That will not help the poor one 
 Different strokes for different folks 
 And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby 
 Ooh sha sha 
 We got to live together 
 There is a yellow one that won't 
 Accept the black one 
 That won't accept the red one 
 That won't accept the white one 
 Different strokes for different folks 
 And so on and so on and 
 Scooby dooby dooby 
 Ooh sha sha 
 I am everyday peopleSo all you fools 
 Who sing just like him 
 Feel free to do so now 
 'Cause he's dead 
 Using, using, using 
 The using takes toll 
 Isolation 
 Just so happy to be one 
 Sad to, sad to think 
 Sad to think of him more 
 Lonesome friend, we all knew 
 Always hoped you'd pull through 
 No blame, no blame 
 No blame, it could be you 
 Using, you can't grow old using 
 So sing just like him, fuckers 
 It won't offend him 
 Just me 
 Because he's deadKnow a man 
 His face seems pulled and tense 
 Like he's riding on a motorbike 
 In the strongest winds 
 So I approach with tact 
 Suggest that he should relax 
 But he's always moving 
 Much too fast 
 Said he'll see me on the flip side 
 On this trip he's taking for a ride 
 He's been taking too much on 
 There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes 
 There he goes... 
 He's yet to come back 
 But I've seen his picture 
 It doesn't look the same 
 Up on the rack 
 We go way back 
 I wonder about his insides 
 It's like his thoughts are too big for his size 
 He's been taken 
 Where I don't know 
 Off he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes 
 There he goes 
 And now I rub my eyes 
 For he has returned 
 Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned 
 For he still smiles 
 And he's still strong 
 Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit 
 That has grown 
 And now he's home 
 And we're laughing like we always did 
 My same old 
 Same old friend 
 Until a quarter-to-ten 
 I saw the strain creep in 
 He seems distracted 
 And I know just what is going to happen then 
 Before his first step 
 He is off againWhen something's dark, let me shed a little light on it 
 When something's cold, let me put a little fire on it 
 If something's old, I want to put a bit of shine on it 
 When something's gone, I want to fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 When something's broke, I want to put a bit of fixing on it 
 When something's bored, I want to put a little excited on it 
 If something's low, I want to put a little high on it 
 When something's lost, I want to fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 When signals cross, I want to put a little straight on it 
 If there's no love, I want to try to love again 
 I’ll say your prayers, I’ll take your side 
 I'll find us a way to make light 
 I'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing 
 What say, could be our last lifetime 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Fight to get it back again 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeahIt's been two years 
 It feels like home... 
 Things can't be the same 
 Wherever you go... 
 I miss you... 
 I don't know 
 If you're gonna call me at home 
 If I go I don't want to feel alone 
 Let's get away, 
 Have some drinks 
 Light my smoke 
 It's all about the simple things 
 Lucky ones! 
 They are all in love. 
 If I go I don't want to feel alone 
 With you I could never feel alone... 
 Alone... 
 Alone...Don't you think you oughta rest 
 Don't you think you oughta lay your head down 
 Don't you think you want to sleep 
 Don't you think you oughta lay your head down... tonight 
 Don't you think you've done enough 
 Oh, don't you think you've got enough, well maybe 
 You don't think there's time to stop 
 There's time enough for you to lay your head down, tonight, 
 Tonight 
 Let it wash away 
 All those yesterdays 
 What are you running from?? 
 Taking pills to get along 
 Creating walls to call your own 
 So no one catches you drifting off and 
 Doing all the things that... we all do 
 Let them wash away 
 All those yesterdays (echo) 
 All those paper plates 
 All those yesterdays 
 All those yesterdays 
 You've got time, you've got time to escape 
 There's still time, it's no crime to escape 
 It's no crime to escape, it's no crime to escape 
 There's still time, so escape... 
 It's no crime, crime 
 All those yesterdays...My numbers up 
 My time has come 
 Sounds like they're playing my song 
 On the altar 
 My picture 
 Will be there while I'm gone 
 There'll be time for laughing 
 There is no time to cry 
 Soon I will be leaving 
 Look me in the eye 
 No matter what's in front of me 
 It's your face that I'll see 
 And the future of our young one 
 And this is what fuels me 
 There's no time for laughing 
 There's no time to cry 
 Soon I will be leaving 
 Look me in the eye 
 The oath I took 
 Not so seriously 
 The worlds gathered steam 
 And caught up with me 
 And my decisions been made 
 Some other place 
 By someone I don't know 
 And they don't know me 
 This is no time for laughing 
 There's no time to cry 
 Soon I will be leaving 
 Look me in the eyeI know about a man to whom I may be related, he's leatherman. 
 Died a long time ago in the 1880's... leatherman, leatherman. 
 Covered with leather, but it wasn't tight. 
 Underneath the moon in the woods at night... 
 Makin' the rounds ten miles a day, 
 Once a month they'd spot him, here's what they'd say... 
 "Here he comes, he's a man of the land. 
 He's leatherman. Smile on his face, an axe in his pack. 
 He's leatherman." 
 Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed. 
 Wasn't known to say but "Thanks for the bread." 
 So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded, 
 Just like a man of leather whom I may be related. 
 Rolled a cigarette, but when he asked for a light, 
 I thought he'd be an animal, but so polite. 
 Makin' the rounds ten miles a day. 
 Once a month they'd spot him and here's what they'd say... 
 "Here he comes, he's a man of the land, he's leatherman. 
 Smile on his face, an axe in his hand. 
 He's leatherman." 
 Shake his hand he's leatherman. 
 Bake some bread he's leatherman. 
 Shame he's dead. I saw his bed, 
 It's all that's left of leatherman. 
 Give me some skin, leatherman.Sailing on my every step 
 Inching off of the earth... 
 It's magnified 
 By the things I've done 
 The thing that I've become 
 Every lift of my hand, 
 Coffee cup up and back, 
 Is magnified 
 By the things I've done 
 The things I've seen, the things I've caused, 
 I'm a dead man walking. 
 The hammer that I once brought down now hovers over me. 
 Casts a shadow, a cross/across onto me. 
 The hallways are all mocking me. 
 What I've become they're all mocking me. 
 I'm a dead man walking. A dead man walking. A dead man walking. 
 I'm a dead man walking. Dead man walking. Dead man walking.Oh please, let it rain today 
 This city's so filthy 
 Like my mind in ways 
 Oh, it was the time 
 Like a clean new taste 
 Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love, yeah 
 Sin for sale, buying just a need 
 All who planted all the devils seeds? 
 And what's the truth? 
 And the truth that lies at home 
 It's on the inside and I can't get it off, yeah 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love, yeah 
 What's clean is pure 
 But hey, I'm white on the outside 
 Though I stray 
 What she don't know today 
 Might kill us both tomorrow 
 Bring it back some way 
 Bring it back, back back 
 Back to the clean form 
 To the pure form 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love 
 Wash my love, eh 
 Wash my, wash my 
 Wash my loveI had a dream the other night 
 You were in a bar in the corner on a chair 
 Wearing a long white leather coat 
 Purple glasses and glitter in your hair 
 And you said hey this is where I'm gonna sit 
 And buy you a drink someday 
 You were going to the dog shows 
 But you kinda lost your way 
 You say now I got all this room 
 And no money to decorate it, so some 
 Local customer put me in touch with the man 
 Upstairs, he said little man you got no 
 Business gettin' frustrated, you gotta rest 
 You gotta rest you gotta reach down 
 And pick the crowd up 
 Carry back in your hands 
 To the promised land 
 Now I had some angel shine my wings, she said 
 Nothin' but the best for the golden boy 
 She made me promise not to tell I had her under 
 A spell singing golden words in a broken voice 
 And I caught some blessing on the wind I'm 
 Feeling lighter than a whisper from a dove 
 I've got no hands to tie behind my back 
 And I'm sparking like a heart attack, now I've got 
 Room to spread my wings and my messages of 
 Love, yes love was my drug, but that's not 
 What I died of, so don't think of me 
 Crying louder than some billion dollar baby 
 'Cause I gotta rest I gotta rest I gotta 
 Reach down and pick the 
 Crowd up, carry back in my 
 Hand to the promised landI'm gonna save you fucker, not gonna lose you 
 Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go 
 Too important to me 
 Too important to us, we'd be lost without you 
 Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now 
 And fuck me if I say something you don't wanna hear, fuck me 
 And fuck me if you only hear what you wanna hear 
 Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here 
 You helped me when I was down, I'll help you when you're down 
 Why are you hitting yourself? C'mon, hit me instead 
 Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy 
 I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now 
 And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfish and clear, clear 
 And you're not leaving here without me, I don't wanna be without 
 My best friend, wake up 
 To see you could have it all, all, wooh 
 'Cause there is but you and something within you 
 It's taken control, let's beat it, get up, let's go 
 Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world 
 Let's pick up your soul 
 And fuck me if I say something you don't wanna hear, fuck me 
 Fuck me 
 And fuck me if you only hear the trouble in your head 
 Please help me to help you help yourself 
 Help me help yourself 
 Please want me to, please let me to 
 Help youHand over my face 
 I am related to my enemy 
 Our house on fire 
 And big brother, brother try to put the blame on me 
 Oh, little sister 
 You and me could rise above 
 Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back 
 I better back off, yeah 
 Ooh, uh-huh 
 He used a flag as a bandage 
 Well, my big brothers they pocket hypocrisy 
 In the closet, my pleasures 
 'Cause big brother, brother don't want to just let me be, yeah 
 Oh, little sister 
 You and me could rise above 
 Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back

 Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back

 Brother, now, yeah 
 Hey now, yeah

 In my mind there's a clearing 
 Rose skies flow through gray skies 
 In no certain way 
 And I'm trying

 Back, back, back, a brother mother

 I was walking with my brother 
 And he wondered, oh how I am 
 Said what I believe in my soul 
 Ain't what I see with my eyes 
 And there's no turning back this time 
 I am a patriot, and I love my country 
 Because my country is all I know 
 Wanna be with my family 
 People who understand me 
 I got no place else to go 
 I was walking with my girlfriend 
 She looked so fine, I said 
 "Baby, what's on your mind?" 
 Said I want to run like the lions 
 Released from their cages 
 Released from the rages 
 Burning in my soul tonight 
 I am a patriot, and I love my country 
 Because my country is all I know 
 And I ain't no Communist 
 And I ain't no Socialist 
 And I ain't no capitalist 
 And I ain't no imperialist 
 And I ain't no Democrat 
 Sure ain't no Republican either 
 I only know one party 
 And that is freedom 
 I am... I am... I am... 
 I am a patriot, and I love my country 
 Because my country is all I know 
 And the rivers shall open for the righteous 
 And the rivers shall open for the righteous 
 And the rivers shall open for the righteous someday 
 Someday... someday...The fruit of love was in the future 
 Around the corner and over the hill 
 The act of love was slowly pounding, slowly pounding, slowly pounding. 
 The Holy War was slowly building 
 Heroes leaving for the Great Crusade 
 Seek reward in the ever after, ever after, ever after. 
 Don't wanna have to lose you baby 
 Don't want to have to take you back 
 You know I'll never lose you baby, abuse you baby, use you baby. 
 You know I'll always help you baby, but you know I just can't do that. 
 I know I said I'd help you baby, here's ny wallet, call me sometime. 
 Act of love... (4x) 
 The fruit of love was in the future 
 Around the corner and over the hill 
 The act of love was slowly pounding, slowly pounding, slowly pounding. 
 Act of love... (4x)It's not all been said, been said and done 
 I've never slept in Satan's bed 
 Although I must admit, still visits my place 
 Uninvited, as you know, he don't wait 
 Funny how he always seems to fit in 
 Funny how I always want to give in 
 Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, the same 
 Sometimes the special guest, he don't like to leave 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already 
 Who made, who made up, made up the myth 
 That we were born to be covered in bliss? 
 Who set the standard, born to be rich? 
 Such fine examples, skinny little bitch 
 Model, role model, roll some models in blood 
 Get some flesh to stick, so they look like us 
 I shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club 
 I'd stop and talk, but I'm already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already 
 In love, ah ha ha ha 
 Follows torture...follows reward 
 Follows torture...follows reward 
 Oh, oh my butt 
 Never shook Satan's hand, look see for yourself 
 You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off 
 I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both 
 Jump off a cliff, don't need your help so back off 
 I'll never suck Satan's dick 
 Again, you'd see it, you know, right 'round the lips 
 I'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath 
 'Magine they're busy, think I'm doing okay 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 Already in love 
 AlreadyBehind her eyes there's curtains 
 And they've been closed to hide the flames, remains 
 She knows their future's burning 
 But she can smile just the same, same 
 And though her mood is fine today 
 There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways 
 Standing like a statue 
 A chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey 
 And though he's too big a man to say 
 There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways 
 Drifting away, drifting away, drifting away, away 
 Drifting away, drifting away, drifting away, awayThought it was easy to fall in love but you, you, you. 
 You're different this much I know yeah, you, you, you. 
 It might be your guile. It could be your mind. 
 It might be the way you take your time. 
 Oh, you, you, you. 
 You, it's you. It's you, you, you. 
 Oh, you. It's you. It's you, you, you. 
 I never know how much to say with you, you, you. 
 I like to go deep but is it safe with you, you, you. 
 It might be your needs. It could be your eyes. 
 It might be the way you sympathize. 
 Oh, you, you, you. 
 You. It's you. It's you, you, you. 
 Oh, you. It's you. It's you you you 
 You break laws and pay no fines. You get yours and then get mine. 
 I don't think it's easy to stay in love. 
 But you, you, you, you. 
 But you, yes you. It's you, you, you. 
 You. it's you. it's you, you, you. 
 Ah you 
 It's you. [x3] 
 Ah you, you, you, yes you. 
 With you, you, you, you ah.He came dancing across the water 
 With his galleons and guns 
 Looking for the new world 
 In that palace in the sun. 
 On the shore lay montezuma 
 With his coca leaves and pearls 
 In his halls he often wondered 
 With the secrets of the worlds. 
 And his subjects gathered round him 
 Like the leaves around a tree 
 In their clothes of many colors 
 For the angry gods to see. 
 And the women all were beautiful 
 And the men stood straight and strong 
 They offered life in sacrifice 
 So that others could go on. 
 Hate was just a legend 
 And war was never known 
 The people worked together 
 And they lifted many stones. 
 They carried them to the flatlands 
 And they died along the way 
 But they built up with their bare hands 
 What we still can't do today. 
 And I know she's living there 
 And she loves me to this day 
 I still can't remember when 
 Or how I lost my way.

 And he died from the street 
 And he hurt so bad like a soul breaking 
 But he never said nothing to me 
 Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven 
 Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven 
 New like a baby 
 Lost like a prayer 
 The sky was your playground 
 But the cold ground was your bed 
 I said poor stargazer 
 She's got no tears in her eyes 
 But smooth like a whisper 
 She knows that love heals all wounds with time 
 Now it seems like too much 
 Love is never enough 
 Yeah, you better seek out another road, baby

 To write these words down for you 
 With the pages of phrases 
 Of all the things we'll never do 
 Yeah, so I blow out, out the candle

 It's a disease and they're all green 
 It emanates from their being 
 A satiation with occupation 
 And like weeds with big leaves 
 Stealing light from what's beneath 
 Where they have more 
 Still they take more 
 I know then I don't 
 There's a stowaway with my throat 
 It's deceiving 
 I don't believe him 
 We can scream out our doors 
 Behind the wall a fat man snores 
 In his dreams he's 
 Choking tea leaves 
 Well I guess 
 There's nothing wrong with what you say 
 But don't sell me 
 "There can't be better ways" 
 Tell the captain 
 "The boat's not safe and we're drowning" 
 Turns out 
 He's the one making waves, waves, waves 
 But I said 
 There's nothing wrong with what you say 
 Believe me

 Or black, just grey

 South of the northern border 
 One small corner on my mind 
 Everybody they know me there 
 Don't get any second glances 
 Chances are that they don't care 
 World as come undone 
 Like they change it everyday 
 Change don't come at once 
 There's a wave building before it breaks 
 Can't wait for election day 
 Where the nasty occupation 
 Corporations rule the day 
 Playing on the pendulum throws 
 Farther out to the one side swinging 
 Has to sweep back the other way 
 The world has come undone 
 Another day and who can wait 
 Change don't come at once 
 It's a wave building before it breaks 
 All this hope and nowhere to go 
 This is how I used to feel but no more 
 The world has come undone 
 Like a game that few can play 
 Change don't come from one 
 It's a wave building before it breaksUnderstand she's a force of nature 
 Contraband hiding deep inside her soul 
 Exorcising her will to lose control 
 She lets go 
 A common man, he don't stand a chance, no 
 Wonderland pulling 
 Alice 
 in the hole 
 No way to save someone who won't take the rope 
 And just lets go 
 One man stands the edge of the ocean 
 A beacon on dry land 
 Eyes upon the horizon 
 In the dark before the dawn 
 Hurricane has the trade winds blowing 
 A gale force shaking windows in the storm 
 Shipwreck on the rock that he calls home 
 With one light on 
 Somewhere there's a siren singing 
 A song only he hears 
 All the strength you might think 
 Would disappear resolving 
 One man stands alone, awaiting 
 For her to come home 
 Eyes upon the horizon 
 In dark before the darkness meets the dawn 
 Makes me ache 
 Makes me shake 
 Is it so wrong to think that love can keep us safe? 
 Last I saw, he was out there waiting 
 A silhouette in the black light, full moon glow 
 In the sand there he stands upon the shore 
 Forevermore 
 Somewhere there's a siren singing 
 A song only he hears 
 All the strength that you might think 
 Would disappear, resolving 
 One man stands alone, awaiting 
 For her to come home 
 Eyes are closed, you cannot know 
 But his heart don't seem to roam 
 Oh, ohHe won the lottery when he was born 
 Took his mother's white breast to his tongue 
 Trained like dogs, color and smell 
 Walks by me to get to him 
 Police man, police man 
 He won the lottery by being born 
 Big hand slapped a white male American 
 Do no wrong, so clean cut 
 Dirty his hands, it comes right off 
 Police man, police man 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police man, police man 
 Jesus greets me, looks just like me 
 Do no wrong, so clean cut 
 Dirty his hands, it comes right off 
 Police man, police man, police man 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police man, police man 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again 
 Police stopped my brother again

 In two weeks, before she could see herself not dressed 
 The twenty-third of May, you know she disturbed no one today 
 The manager told her to completely forget 
 If you ever go to bed, I'll kill you 
 Do I tell the whole world that I'm mentally ill? 
 Go to the papers, yeah, why not? 
 Drum roll 
 I want to show them that I can walk on my own without hands of theirs 
 And, I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself 
 Keep it to myself, keep it to myself 
 I think I deserve to be loved, don't you? 
 Very much so 
 Think I deserve to be loved 
 Keep it to myself, keep it to myself 
 I think I deserve to be loved, don't you? 
 To be loved, don't you? 
 But I keep it to myself, keep it to myself, keep it to myself 
 I think I deserve to be loved, don't you? 
 And, I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself 
 Keep it to myself, keep it to myself 
 I think I deserve to be loved, don't you? 
 Very much so 
 Do you ever think that you would actually, really kill yourself? 
 Well, if I have thought about it real, uh, real deep 
 Yes, I believe I would 
 I have thought about it real, uh, real deep 
 Yes, I believe I would 
 And, I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself 
 Keep it to myself, keep it to myself

 Do you ever think that you actually would kill yourself? 
 Well, if I have thought about it real, uh, real deep 
 Yes, I believe I wouldMmm, wide awake and he shakes in a panic 
 Never woke up alone ever before 
 Had his woman long as he can remember 
 Tries to forget, but he can't, he can't 
 Out of bed and he dreams in the shower 
 She's standing naked, he's apologizing 
 Reaches for her till his mind becomes blood hot 
 Woken up to be burned, burned again 
 Go it alone 
 You got it, so it goes 
 Got his knees to his face 
 He can't take it any other way 
 On the street he's walking wounded 
 Doesn't smile for the child at play 
 Thoughts of suicide and alleviation 
 Anything to get his heart off of the coals 
 Does he fly away or just talk about it? 
 Like a seagull born to cry in the wind 
 Own experiences lead to a younger 
 All alone, you will meet the one who lies in wait 
 Go it alone 
 You got it so it goes 
 Try to breathe, but he can't 
 He can't take it for another day, yeah yeah 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself, myself 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself, myself 
 I can help myself, don't talk to me 
 I can help myself 
 Wide awake and he shakes in a panic 
 Never woke up alone ever before 
 Had his woman long as he can remember 
 Tries to forget, but he can't, he can'tNo, I won't back down 
 No, I won't back down 
 You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down 
 I will stand my ground, won't be turned around 
 I will keep my world from draggin' me down, I won't back down 
 No, I won't back down 
 Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out 
 Hey, I will stand my ground 
 No, I won't back down 
 Oh, I know what's right, I got just one life 
 I wil keep this world from pushin' me around, I'll stand my ground 
 No, I won't back down 
 Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out 
 Hey, I will stand my ground 
 And I won't back down 
 Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out 
 Hey, I will stand my ground 
 And I won't back down 
 And I won't back down, no I won't back downVacate is the word 
 Vengeance has no place in me to hurt 
 Cannot find the comfort in this world 
 Artificial tears 
 Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers? 
 Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere 
 A truant finds home 
 And a wish to hold onto 
 But there's a trapdoor in the sun 
 Immortality 
 As privileged as a whore 
 Victims in demand for public show 
 Swept out through the cracks beneath the door 
 Holier than thou, how? 
 Surrendered, executed, anyhow 
 Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor 
 A truant finds home 
 And a wish to hold onto 
 There's a trapdoor in the sun 
 I cannot stop the thought 
 Of running in the dark 
 Coming up a which way sign 
 All good truants must decide 
 Oh, stripped and sold, mom 
 Auctioned forearm 
 And whiskers in the sink 
 Truants go on 
 Cannot stay long 
 Some die just to liveIn the moonlight... 
 Gettin'. Wind out to get back. It's a... 
 Steady shore to her land. 
 It's gettin' closer to the fence. 
 In the moonlight... 
 Givin'. Two lost wings. 
 A beautiful star sea. 
 A wonderful sense of beauty. 
 In the moonlight... 
 It's a love drawn nearer. 
 Darkened days are spent in. 
 A night bird is followin' you all the time. 
 Under a star-lined ceiling... 
 And darkness so sleep. Ah,... 
 Your sense is revealed... 
 In the moonlight... 
 It's a love drawn nearer. 
 Darkened days are spent in. 
 A night bird is followin' you all the time. 
 It's a love drawn nearer. 
 Darkened days are spent in. 
 A night bird is followin' you,... it's followin' you. 
 A night bird is followin' you all the time.Seen it happen to a couple of friends. 
 See it happen and the message it sends. 
 Taking off for what's an obvious fall. 
 Just to see what all the fuss is about. 
 It's not your way. 
 Not your way. 
 It's not your way. 
 Another habit says it's in love with you. 
 Another habit says it's love's overdue. 
 Another habit like an unwanted friend. 
 I'm so happy with my righteous self. 
 It's not your way. 
 Not your way. 
 It's not your way. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 I never thought you'd... never thought you'd... 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 I never thought you'd... never never thought you'd... 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Speaking as a child of the 90's... 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 I never thought you... Never thought you. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 Never thought you'd habit. 
 I never thought you... Never never thought you. 
 Never... Never me. Never you. Never me.I don't mind all the guys dancing with my girl 
 That's fine, I know them all pretty well 
 And I know sometimes I must get out in the light 
 Better leave her behind where the kids are alright 
 The kids are alright 
 Sometimes, I know I gotta get away 
 Bells chime, I know I gotta get away 
 And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind 
 Better leave her behind where the kids are alright 
 The kids are alright 
 I know if I go things would be a lot better for her 
 I had this plan but her folks wouldn't let her 
 I don't mind, I feel I gotta get away 
 Bells chime, I know I gotta get away 
 And I know if I don't I'll go out of my fuckin' mind 
 Better leave her behind where the kids are alright 
 The kids are alright 
 The kids are alright 
 The kids are alrightHold on to the thread 
 The currents will shift, glide me towards 
 You know something's left 
 And we're all allowed to dream of the next 
 Uh 
 Of the next time we touch 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 You don't have to stray the oceans away 
 Waves roll in my thoughts 
 Hold tight the ring 
 The sea will rise 
 Please stand by the shore 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, I will be 
 I will be there once more 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Uh-huh, oh 
 Uh-huh, ohTalk of circles, punching out 
 Looking in, drawing circles down 
 Falling off the south marking ground 
 Talking out of turn, drawing circles down 
 Like Pilate, I have a dog 
 Like Pilate, I have a dog 
 Walks me out of town, still one's a crowd 
 Making angels in the dirt, looking up, looking all around 
 Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves) 
 Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves) 
 Stunned by my own reflection 
 It's looking back, sees me too clearly 
 And I swore I'd never go there again 
 Not unlike a friend that 
 Politely drags you down, you down, you down, you down 
 Like Pilate, I have a dog (obeys, listens, kisses, loves) }x4And out isn't perfect 
 My friends, I'll say it too 
 Stay my case, of which I'm certain 
 I've lived a life as full 
 I've travelled each and every highway 
 Oh, and more, as more gets... 
 I did it my way 
 Regrets, I've had a few 
 But they're too few to mention 
 I did what I had 
 It's all through without exemption 
 I play each charted course 
 I've travelled each and every by-way 
 And more, much more than this... 
 I did it my way... 
 Well twice, I'm sure you knew 
 When I bit off more than I could chew 
 I knew it all, without a doubt 
 I ate it up and I had to spit it out 
 I passed it on, and I stood tall 
 And I did it my way...I've seen puzzles made out of wood 
 I've seen games with pieces and rules 
 I've decipered a trick or two at the bar 
 But there's a lot I haven't figured out this far 
 I've come up with riddles and jokes about war 
 I've figured out numbers and what balance sheets are for 
 I've understood feelings and I've understood words but the mystery remains 
 I miss you 
 You are never more beautiful than at the end of the day 
 When the world is away 
 Oh, this way 
 We can all run away 
 We can't all disappear 
 At the end of the day 
 You come back here... 
 Here... 
 It's been a long, long day 
 And it's hard to say I'm just a drunk 
 Oh, just a drunk 
 If you can imagine words 
 All that remains 
 Oh, still I'm just drunk 
 A puddle in the parking lot 
 You are never more beautiful than at the end of the day 
 And the world's away 
 Oh, we can all run away 
 But we can't all disappear 
 At the end of the day 
 You come back here 
 You are never more beautiful than at the end of the day 
 From far away 
 We can all run away 
 But we can't all disappear 
 But at the end of the day 
 We come back here 
 Back here 
 Come back hereHey fellas, have you heard the news?

 But I'm glad we talked." 
 Oh, I, oh, I'm still alive 
 Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive 
 Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive 
 Hey, oh 
 Oh, she walks slowly across a young man's room 
 She said, "I'm ready for you." 
 I can't remember anything to this very day 
 'Cept the look, the look 
 Oh, you know where 
 Now, I can't see, I just stare 
 I, I'm still alive 
 Hey, I, but, I'm still alive 
 Hey, I, but, I'm still alive 
 Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah 
 Ooh 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh 
 "Is something wrong?" she said 
 Of course there is 
 "You're still alive," she said 
 Oh, but do I deserve to be? 
 Is that the question? 
 And if so, if so, who answers? Who answers? 
 I, oh, I'm still alive

 Shell of the man from the sea

 Reservoir of hate and fear 
 Invisible, in repair 
 A hundred thieves cast a spell 
 This is hell 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes 
 He looks just like me, a mirror 
 The more you read, we've been deceived 
 Everyday it becomes clearer 
 Clearer, clearer, clearer, clearer... 
 Not my enemy 
 No, not my enemy 
 Don't speak for me 
 No, not my enemyPlaque on the wall says that no one's slept here 
 It's rare to come upon a bridge that has not 
 Been around or been stepped on 
 Whatever the notion, we laced in our prayers 
 The man upstairs who's used to all of this noise 
 I'm through with screaming 
 And echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes 
 Like echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes like 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 And echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes 
 Echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 
 So faithful, we all believe, we all believe 
 M-Y-T-H is belief in the game 
 Controls that keeps us in a box of fear 
 We never listen voice inside 
 So drowned out, drowned you are, you are, you are everything 
 And everything is you 
 Me you, you me, it's all related 
 What's a boy to do? 
 Just be darling and I will be too 
 Faithful to youUnderneath this smile lies everything 
 All my hopes and anger, pride and shame 
 Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past 
 Just for today I am free 
 I will not lose my faith 
 It's an inside job today 
 I know this one thing well 
 I used to try to kill love, was the highest sin 
 Breathing insecurity out and in 
 Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight 
 Pursuing the greater way for all human light 
 How I choose to feel is how I am 
 How I choose to feel is how I am 
 I will not lose my faith 
 It's an inside job today 
 Holding on, the light of night 
 On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul 
 Again 
 Let me run into the rain 
 To be a human light again 
 Let me run into the rain 
 To shine a human light today 
 Life comes from within your heart and desire 
 Oh, life comes from within my heart and desire 
 Oh, life comes from within your heart and desire 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Run in rainOh, tonight began with anything 
 Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream, ah yeah

 Where it goes - where it comes 
 Can't see through the faith, whoa 
 Ooh, come - here it comes 
 There it goes, grasp what you can 
 Until there's something inside your head, yeah 
 Oh, if I knew where it was I would take you there 
 There's much more than this, ooh 
 Much more than this 
 Oh, see the world- much more than, oh 
 Much more than 
 Why?Doctor said I, I'd be all right 
 Oh, everything that I believed, it wasn't true 
 I found it out when I got close to you 
 I thought you were different, like a dream 
 Things they ain't never what they seem, whoa 
 Thought I could trust you with my soul 
 But you can't do that anymore 
 The doctor said I'd be all right, but I still feel blue 
 The doctor said I'd be all right, but I still love you 
 Love you, hate you... 
 Love you, want you, hate you... 
 Ah, yeah... 
 I'm different 
 Me myself, I'm different than all the rest 
 I can only speak for myself, but people can trust meYou're always saying that there's something wrong 
 I'm starting to believe it's your plan all along 
 Death came around, forced to hear its song 
 And know tomorrow can't be depended on 
 Seen the home inside your head 
 All locked doors and unmade beds 
 Open sores unattended 
 Let me say just once that 
 I have faced it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 I escaped it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 Having tasted, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 The world awaits just up the stairs 
 Leave the pain for someone else 
 Nothing back there for you to find 
 Or was it you who you left behind? 
 You're always saying you're too weak to be strong 
 You're harder on yourself than just about anyone 
 Why swim the channel just to get this far? 
 Halfway there, why would you turn around? 
 Darkness comes in waves 
 Tell me, why invite it to stay? 
 You're one with negativity 
 Yes, comfort is an energy 
 But why let the sad song play? 
 I have faced it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 Oh I escaped it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 Having tasted, a life wasted, I'm never going back again 
 Oh I erased it, a life wasted, I'm never going back againI want for to lay down 
 I'm waiting till sundown, uh 
 I'm searching the haystacks 
 Water is sunshine 
 Wait for the moment 
 The moment between us 
 The fire is made now 
 Harder to touch 
 I wanted to get right 
 I wanted to get right 
 I wanted to get right 
 With it, with you 
 Baker's dozen parades 
 Stand and debate 
 Out single file 
 Nine in a row 
 Swear if you must 
 Keeping your boots on 
 Float with the now 
 Hot to the touch 
 Concrete underground 
 Cast out everyday 
 Dregs of society 
 Underbelly 
 Inside of me 
 Rejoice and follow thee 
 I wanted to get right

 Ooh, and if you leave me 
 I won't be late again no no, no 
 Oh no 
 Yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah 
 Whoo ooh oh yeah 
 And I don't understand how come nobody told me 
 Why I'd want to sing like a Milli Vanilli? 
 All I ever wanted was someone who looked like you 
 I got a feeling 
 That keeps me on my toes, oh yeah yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh huh, I got a feeling 
 I think that everybody knows, oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah, wow I got a feeling 
 Yeah, whoa 
 Everybody had a good year 
 Though we never saw the sunshine 
 Everybody had a wet dream 
 Making Temple was a good time 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Everybody made a movie 
 Everybody had one line 
 Everybody misses Andy 
 We'll be seeing him in no time

 Yeah ah, ooh, yeahJohnny Guitar Watson staring at me 
 Riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee 
 With a leg under a red dress I wish I could see 
 Further north a warmth alive and lingering 
 Now Johnny, he be having lots of women 
 The reason he be smiling known to him 
 On the left, the girl in red so innocent 
 Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed 
 Yeah, the type of girl responsible for original sin 
 Can't help but wonder where and who she is 
 And the memory is always getting clearer 
 For that's 30 years and more I've loved her so 
 And how I need to know why she's with him 
 And I sleep with the light on in case she comes 
 And I sleep with the light on in case she 
 Recently as I was waiting on a dream 
 She came to visit lost and lonely me 
 Oh, she leaned over the bed & with her lips above my head 
 She asked if I had seen her Johnny 
 Oh and I hide my disappointment 
 'Cause for years I have been hoping 
 Oh yeah, I had been hoping 
 That when she came, she would come for me 
 I hide my disappointment 'cause for years I had been hoping 
 That when she came, she'd be coming just for me 
 I'll hide my disappointment 'cause for years I have been hoping 
 That when she came she'd be coming just for meWe had this bright idea one late summer night 
 Candy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door 
 I guess the heat got to it, dripped and melted all over the floor 
 Chocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard 
 I had to laugh not to cry 
 Now all your possessions, all of your things, all of your hopes, schemes, desires, and most of all, your dreams 
 All gone away... gone away... 
 All gone away... gone away... 
 All gone away 
 "Live for today", you said, "live for today" 
 I had to laugh not to cry 
 I had to laugh not to cry, not to cry...She lived on the curve in the road 
 In an old tar paper shack 
 On the south side of the town 
 On the wrong side of the tracks 
 Sometimes on the way into town 
 We'd say, "Mama can we stop and give her a ride?" 
 Sometimes we did 
 But her hands flew from her side 
 Wild eyed Crazy Mary 
 Down the long dirt road, past the parson's place 
 That old blue car we used to race 
 Little country store with a sign tacked to the side 
 Said "No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G Allowed" 
 Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd. 
 Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around 
 Take a bottle drink it down, drink it 
 Pass it around, pass it a- 
 A-take a bottle drink it down, pass it 
 Pass it a-, pass it around 
 One night thunder cracked 
 Mercy backed outside her windowsill 
 Dreamed I was flying high above the trees, over the hills 
 Looked down into the house of Mary 
 Terrible thoughts, newspaper covered walls 
 And Mary rising up above it all 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Next morning on the way into town 
 Saw some skid marks and followed them around 
 Over the curve 
 Through the fields 
 Into the house of Mary 
 That what you fear the most could meet you halfway 
 That what you fear the most could meet you halfway 
 Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around 
 Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around 
 Take a bottle drink it down, pass it a-, pass it around 
 Yeah 
 Pass it a- 
 Pass it around 
 Pass it a-, pass it a-The waiting drove me mad 
 You're finally here and I'm a mess 
 I take your entrance back 
 Can't let you roam inside my head 
 I don't want to take what you can give 
 I would rather starve than eat your bread 
 I would rather run but I can't walk 
 Guess I'll lie alone just like before 
 I'll take the varmint's path 
 Oh, and I must refuse your test 
 Push me and I will resist 
 This behavior's not unique 
 I don't want to hear from those who know 
 They can buy, but can't put on my clothes 
 I don't want to limp for them to walk 
 Never would have known of me before 
 I don't want to be held in your debt 
 I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed 
 I'm already cut up and half-dead 
 I'll end up alone like I began 
 Everything has chains 
 Absolutely nothing's changed 
 Take my hand, not my picture 
 Spilled my tincture 
 I don't want to take what you can give 
 I would rather starve than eat your breast 
 All the things that others want for me 
 Can't buy what I want because it's free 
 Can't buy what I want because it's free 
 Can't be what you want because I'm 
 Ain't supposed to be just one 
 Oh, to live and die, let it be done 
 I figure I'll be damned 
 All alone like I began 
 It's your move now 
 I thought you were a friend 
 But I guess I... I guess I hate you...I can feel the dawn 
 I can feel the Earth 
 I can feel the living 
 All around, 'round, 'round, 'round 
 All around, 'round, 'round, 'round 
 I could choose a path 
 I could choose the word 
 I can start the healing 
 Bring it now, now, now, now 
 Bring it now, now, now 
 Whispered songs inside the wind 
 Breathing in forgiveness 
 Like vibrations with no end 
 Hear the planet humming 
 What is clear far from the noise 
 Get swallowed whole 
 I could feel the sun 
 I can see the sound 
 I could set myself right here 
 And drown, drown, drown, drown 
 Drown, drown, drown 
 I can feel the rush 
 I could clear the clouds 
 I could set the needle 
 Spin it loud, loud, loud, loud, loud 
 Loud, loud, loud, loud 
 I can hear the crash 
 I can feel the pound 
 I can feel the current 
 Pulling down, down, down, down 
 Down, down, down, down 
 Whispered songs inside the wind 
 Breathing in forgiveness 
 Like vibrations with no end 
 Feel the planet humming 
 What is clear far from the noise 
 Gets swallowed whole 
 With no quiet to be found 
 Spirit lifted off the ground 
 And what lies beyond the grave 
 Might be welcome change 
 Time will come, come what may 
 With no rest in peace 
 Until that day, hey yeah 
 I could choose a path 
 I could choose the word 
 I can start the healing 
 Bring it now, now, now, now 
 Now, now, now, now 
 I could be the sun 
 I can be the sound 
 I could set myself right here 
 And drown Drown drown drown 
 Drown drown drown drown 
 Whispered songs inside the wind 
 Breathing in forgiveness 
 And the chapter I've not read 
 Turn the pageConsider me an object 
 Put me in a vacuum 
 Free of all conditions 
 Free of air and friction 
 Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down 
 And there I will swing for all eternity 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah, next stop falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Comatose, with no fear of falling 
 Consider me an abscess 
 Leave me in my vacuum 
 Blood on all the pistons 
 Running my transmission 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah, next stop falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Comatose, with no fear of falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah, next stop falling 
 Feel it rising 
 High above, I'll break the law 
 If it's illegal to be in love 
 Leave the hatred on the cross 
 Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down 
 And here I will swing for all eternity 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah, next stop falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Comatose, with no fear of falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Yeah, next stop falling 
 Feel it rising 
 Something never thought you'd be part ofYeah, I been dreaming of getting along 
 Now I am awake, dreaming keep it on, keeping on 
 I catch a break, then a punch to the head 
 I smile big with a toothless grin, yeah 
 Supersonic gone & took my soul 
 I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow, yeah 
 Supersonic, truth be told 
 I don't need you to live, to ever let you go 
 Yeah 
 Yeah, I've been thinking, I already know 
 Nothing bout nothing, or so I have been told, yeah 
 I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold 
 I cut the crease and put the shit in the hole 
 Supersonic gone and took my soul 
 I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow, yeah 
 Supersonic, truth be told 
 I don't need you to live, to ever let you go, yeah 
 Supersonic, gonna feel it now 
 I need to hear it, need to feel it loud yeah 
 Supersonic, truth be told 
 I wanna live my life with the volume full 
 Supersonic gone and took my soul 
 I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow, yeah 
 Supersonic, truth be told 
 I don't need you to live, to ever let you go, yeah 
 Supersonic, gonna feel it now 
 I need to hear it, need to feel it loud yeah 
 Supersonic, truth be told 
 I wanna live my life with the volume full, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeahWell, she's walking through the clouds 
 With a circus mind, 
 That's running wild. 
 Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams 
 And fairytales, 
 That's all she ever thinks about ... 
 Riding with the wind. 
 When I'm sad, she comes to me 
 With a thousand smiles 
 She gives to me free. 
 It's alright, she says, 
 It's alright; 
 Take anything you want from me, 
 Anything.Once divided and nothing left to subtract 
 Some words when spoken can't be taken back 
 Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking 
 Future's above, but in the past, he's slow and sinking 
 Caught a bolt of lightning 
 Cursed the day he let it go 
 Nothingman 
 Nothingman 
 Isn't it something? 
 Nothingman 
 She once believed in every story he had to tell 
 One day she stiffened, took the other side 
 Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell 
 One just escapes, one's left inside the well 
 And he who forgets 
 Will be destined to remember 
 Nothingman 
 Nothingman 
 Isn't it something? 
 Nothingman 
 Oh, she don't want him 
 Oh, she won't feed him 
 After he's flown away 
 Oh, into the sun, ah, into the sun 
 Burn, burn 
 Nothingman 
 Nothingman 
 Isn't it something? 
 Nothingman 
 Nothingman 
 Nothingman 
 Could've been something 
 Nothingman 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 OhSorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette 
 Thinks he'll get the girl he'll only get the mechanic 
 What's missing? 
 He's living a day he'll soon forget 
 That's one more time around, the sun is going down 
 The moon is out but he's drunk and shouting 
 Putting people down, he's pissing 
 He's living a day he'll soon forget 
 Counts his money every morning 
 The only thing that keeps him horny 
 Locked in a giant house that's alarming 
 The townsfolk they all laugh 
 Sorry is the fool who trades his love for high rise rent 
 Seem the more you make equals the loneliness you get 
 And it's fitting 
 He's barely living a day he'll soon forget 
 That's one more time around and there is not a sound 
 He's lying dead clutching Benjamins 
 Never put the money down, he's stiffening 
 We're all whistling a man we'll soon forgetYesterdays, how quick they change 
 All lost and long gone now 
 It's hard to remember anything 
 Moving at the speed of sound 
 Moving with the speed of sound 
 And yet I’m still holding tight 
 To this dream of distant light 
 And that somehow I’ll survive 
 But this night has been a long one 
 Waiting on a sun that just don't come 
 Can I forgive what I 
 Cannot forget and live a lie? 
 I could give it one more try 
 Why deny this drive inside? 
 Just looking for some peace 
 Everytime I get me some it gets the best of me 
 Not much left you see 
 And yet I’m still holding tight 
 To this dream of distant light 
 And that somehow I’ll survive 
 But this night has been a long one 
 Waiting on a word that never comes 
 A whisper in the dark 
 Is that you or just my thoughts? 
 I'm wide awake and reaching out 
 It’s gone so quiet now 
 Could it be I’m farther out? 
 Moving faster than the speed of soundI've just seen a face 
 I can't forget the time or place where we just met 
 She's just the girl for me 
 I want all the world to see we've met 
 Da, da, da, da-da, da... 
 Had it been another day 
 I might have looked the other way 
 Adn I'd have never been aware 
 As it is I'll dream of her tonight 
 Da, da, da, da-da, da... 
 Oh, yeah, yes I'm fallin' 
 And she keeps callin' me back again 
 (X2)Hey 
 Hey yeah uh 
 Sheets of empty canvas 
 Untouched sheets of clay 
 Were laid spread out before me 
 As her body once did 
 Oh, all five horizons 
 Revolved around her soul 
 As the Earth to the sun 
 Now the air I've tasted and breathed 
 Has taken a turn 
 Ooh oh, and all I taught her was 
 Everything 
 Ooh oh, I know she gave me all that she wore 
 And now my bitter hands 
 Chafe beneath the clouds 
 Of what was everything 
 Oh, the pictures have 
 All been washed in black 
 Tattooed everything 
 I take a walk outside 
 I'm surrounded by some kids at play, yeah 
 I can feel their laughter 
 So why do I sear? 
 Ooh oh, and twisted thoughts that spin 
 'Round my head 
 I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning 
 How quick the sun can 
 Drop away 
 And now my bitter hands 
 Cradle broken glass 
 Of what was everything 
 All the pictures have 
 All been washed in black 
 Tattooed everything 
 All the love gone bad 
 Turned my world to black 
 Tattooed all I see, all that I am 
 All I'll be, yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Woo 
 I know someday you'll have a beautiful life 
 I know you'll be a star 
 In somebody else's sky 
 But why, why, why can't it be 
 Can't it be mine? 
 (Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) 
 (Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) 
 Oh ah yeah

 Ah ooh hoo

 (Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) 
 (Ooh hoo) 
 (Ooh hoo)Lonely drifter on the hill. Why do I? 
 One must have a heart of steel. Why do I? 
 It's not how you look, but how you feel. Why do I? 
 You must have a heart of steel. Why do I? 
 Why do I keep fucking up? 
 I can see you on the hill. Why do I? 
 All comatose but walking still. Why do I? 
 Flowing curves beneath your flowing gown. Why do I? 
 Oh, only I can bring myself down. Why do I? 
 Why do I keep fuckin' up? 
 Bowman's pick and dogs that bite. Why do I? 
 Oh, dogs that howl through the night. Why do I? 
 Oh, broken leashes all over the floor. Why do I? 
 Keys left hanging in a swinging door. Why do I? 
 Why do I keep fucking up?How does he do it? how do they do it? uncanny and immutable 
 This is such a happening tailpipe of a party 
 Like sugar, the guests are so refined 
 A confidence man, but why so beleaguered? 
 He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer 
 Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike 
 Drilling for fear makes the job simple 
 Born on third, thinks he got a triple 
 Blackout weaves its way through the city 
 Blackout weaves its way through the city 
 Blackout weaves its way 
 I remember when you sang that song about today 
 Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed 
 A think tank of aloof multiplication 
 A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter 
 Retrenchment and hoggishness 
 The aristocrat choir sings, "what's the ruckus?" 
 The haves have not a clue 
 The immenseness of suffering 
 And the odd negotiation, a rarity 
 With onionskin plausibility of life 
 And a keyboard reaffirmation 
 Blackout weaves its way through the city 
 Blackout weaves its way through the city 
 Blackout weaves its way 
 I remember when you sang that song about today 
 Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed 
 I remember when you sang that song about today 
 Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed 
 Changed, changed, chainsRestless soul, enjoy your youth 
 Like Muhammad, hits the truth 
 Can't escape from the common rule 
 If you hate something, don't you do it, too 
 Small my table, sits just two 
 Got so crowded, I can't make room 
 Oh, where did they come from? Stormed my room 
 And you dare say it belongs to you, to you 
 This is not for you 
 This is not for you 
 This is not for you 
 Oh, not for you, not you 
 Scream, my friends, don't call me 
 Friends, no, they don't scream 
 My friends don't call 
 My friends don't 
 All that's sacred comes from youth 
 Dedication, naive and true 
 With no power, nothing to do 
 I still remember, why don't you? 
 Don't you 
 This is not for you 
 This is not for you 
 This is not for you 
 Oh, never was for you, fuck you 
 This is not for you 
 Oh, this is not for you, yeah, you 
 This is not for you 
 Oh, not for you 
 Oh, youYou never listen to a word I said 
 You only seen me 
 For the clothes I wear 
 Or did the interest go so much deeper 
 It must have been 
 The length of my hair 
 The public image 
 What you wanted was never made clear 
 Behind the image was ignorance and fear 
 You hide behind this public machine 
 Still follow the same old scheme 
 Public image 
 Two sides to every story 
 Somebody had to stop me 
 I'm not the same as when I began 
 I will not be a property 
 Public image 
 Two sides to every story 
 Somebody had to stop me 
 I'm not the same as when I began 
 It's not a game of monopoly 
 Public image 
 Public image 
 You got what you wanted 
 The public image belongs to me 
 It's my entrance 
 My own creation 
 My grand finale 
 My goodbye 
 Public image 
 Public image 
 GoodbyeAll the photographs are peeling 
 And colors turned to gray, he stayed 
 In his room with memories for days, he faced 
 An undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced 
 By the loss of one he could not replace 
 And there's no reason that she passed 
 And there is no god with a plan, it's sad 
 And his holiness is proof, it's sad 
 He could only love you, it's sad 
 The door swings to a passing fable 
 A fate we may delay, we say 
 Holding on, to live within our embrace 
 Eleven nights he laid in bed 
 Hoping that dreams will bring her back, it's sad 
 And his loneliness is proof, it's sad 
 He could only love you, it's sad 
 Holding his last breath, believing 
 He'll make his way 
 But she's not forgotten 
 He's haunted 
 He's searching for escape 
 If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent 
 And his holiness is proof, it's sad 
 He will always love you, it's sadShe don't wander in...don't wander in here, she... 
 She don't wander in here...don't wander in here... 
 The direction of the eye, so misleading 
 The defection of the soul, nauseously quick 
 I don't question our existence 
 I just question our modern needs 
 She don't wander in...don't wander in here, she... 
 She don't wander in here... 
 I will walk with my hands bound 
 I will walk with my face blood 
 I will walk with my shadow flag 
 Into your garden, garden of stone, yeah 
 After all is done and we're still alone 
 I won't be taken, yet I'll go 
 With my hands bound 
 I will walk with my face blood 
 I will walk with my shadow flag 
 Into your garden, garden of stone 
 I don't show 
 I don't share 
 I don't need, yeah 
 What you have to give 
 Ooh, I will walk with my hands bound 
 I will walk with my face blood 
 I will walk with my shadow flag 
 Into your garden, garden of 
 I will walk with my hands bound 
 I will walk into your garden 
 Garden of stone 
 I don't know 
 I don't care 
 I don't need, ow 
 Need to live 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huh 
 Uh huh huhShe said to me, over the phone 
 She wanted to see other people 
 I thought, "well then, look around, they're everywhere" 
 Said that she was confused... 
 I thought, "darling, join the club" 
 24 Years old, mid-life crisis 
 Nowadays hits you when you're young 
 I hung up, she called back, I hung up again 
 The process had already started 
 At least it happened quick 
 I swear, I died inside that night 
 My friend, he called 
 I didn't mention a thing 
 The last thing he said was, "be sound" 
 Sound... 
 I contemplated an awful thing, I hate to admit 
 I just thought those would be such appropriate last words 
 But I'm still here 
 And small 
 So small... how could this struggle seem so big? 
 So big... 
 While the palms in the breeze still blow green 
 And the waves in the sea still absolute blue 
 But the horror 
 Every single thing I see is a reminder of her 
 Never thought I'd curse the day I met her 
 And since she's gone and wouldn't hear 
 Who would care? what good would that do? 
 But I'm still here 
 So I imagine in a month... or 12 
 I'l be somewhere having a drink 
 Laughing at a stupid joke 
 Or just another stupid thing 
 And I can see myself stopping short 
 Drifting out of the present 
 Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep 
 And there I am, standing 
 Wet grass and white headstones all in rows 
 And in the distance there's one, off on its own 
 So I stop, kneel 
 My new home... 
 And I picture a sober awakening, a re-entry into this little bar scene 
 Sip my drink till the ice hits my lip 
 Order another round 
 And that's it for now 
 Sorry 
 Never been too good at happy endings...I've used hammers made out of wood 
 I have played games with pieces and rules 
 I've deciphered tricks at the bar 
 But now you're gone I haven't figured out why 
 I've come up with riddles and jokes about war 
 I figured out numbers and what they're for 
 I've understood feelings and I've understood words 
 But how could you be taken away? 
 And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
 It don't seem fair, today just disappeared 
 Your light's reflected now, reflected from afar 
 We were but stones, your light made us stars 
 With heavy breath, awakened regrets 
 Back pages and days alone that could have been spent 
 Together, but we were miles apart 
 Every inch between us becomes light years now 
 No time to be void or save up on life 
 Oh, you got to spend it all 
 And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
 It don't seem fair, you seemed to like it here 
 Your light's reflected now, reflected from afar 
 We were but stones, your light made us stars 
 And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
 It don't seem fair, today just disappeared 
 Your light's reflected now, reflected from afar 
 We were but stones, your light made us starsHe's got a big gold ring which says "Jesus Saves" 
 And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day 
 When he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things 
 After the big boss say, 
 "You best be on your way" 
 So this life is sacrifice 
 Oh yeah 
 Jumping trains just to survive 
 Well his wife and kid's asleep but he's still awake 
 And his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid 
 Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate 
 Thinking if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream again? 
 So this life is sacrificed 
 Oh yeah 
 To a stranger's bottom line 
 Oh yeah 
 I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh 
 I'm scared alive 
 Nearly dead 
 Oho oh oh oho oh ohh 
 I've seen the light 
 Still alive 
 Yeah 
 So this life is sacrificed 
 Oh yeah 
 Was a dream that had to die 
 Oh yeah 
 I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh 
 I'm scared alive 
 Near to death 
 Oho oh oh oho oh oh 
 I've seen the light 
 Scared alive 
 Oho ohhh ohhhhh oooohoooo 
 I'm here to die 
 Here to die 
 Scared alive 
 Here to die 
 Here to die 
 Scared of lifeAll in all, it's no one's fault 
 excuses turn to carbon walls 
 Blame it all on chemical intercourse 
 The swallowed seeds of arrogance 
 Breeding in the thoughts of ten- 
 Thousand fools who fight irrelevance 
 The full moon is dead skin 
 The one down here is wearing thin 
 So set up the ten pins 
 As the human tide rolls in 
 Like a ball that's spinning 
 Bombs dropping down 
 Overhead, underground 
 It's instilled to wanna live 
 Bombs, dropping down 
 Please forgive our hometown 
 In our insignificance 
 "Turn the jukebox up," 
 he said, 
 Dancing in irreverance 
 "Play C3, let the song protest." 
 The plates begin to shift 
 Perfect lefts come rolling in 
 I was alone and far away 
 When I heard the band start playing 
 On the lip, late take off 
 Bombs dropping down 
 Overhead, underground 
 It's instilled to wanna live 
 Bombs, dropping down 
 Please forgive our hometown 
 In our insignificance 
 Feel like resonance of distance 
 In the blood, the iron lies 
 It's instilled to wanna live 
 Bombs, dropping down 
 Please forgive our hometown 
 In our insignificance 
 In our insignificanceYou ever heard the story 
 Of Mr. Faded Glory? 
 Say he who rides a pony must someday fall 
 I been talkin' to my alter 
 Says life is what you make it 
 And if you make it death well then rest 
 Your soul away 
 Away away yeah 
 It's a broken kind of feeling 
 She'd have to tie me to the ceiling 
 A bad moon's a comin' 
 Better say your prayers 
 I wanna tell you that I love you 
 But does it really matter? 
 I just can't stand to see you dragging down. 
 Again, again, again. 
 So I'm singing 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's the kind that moves on 
 It's the kind that leaves you alone 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's the kind that moves on 
 It's the kind and leaves me alone 
 I used to treat you like a lady 
 Now you're a substitute teacher 
 This bottle's not a prayer, not a prayer in sight 
 I owe the man some money 
 So I'm turnin' over honey 
 Oh Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin' time. 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's the kind that moves on 
 It's the kind that leaves me alone 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's a crown of thorns 
 It's the kind that 
 It's the kind that leaves me alone 
 Like a crown of thorns 
 It's all who you know. 
 So don't burn your bridges cause 
 Someday, yeah 
 Start singing 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's the kind that moves on 
 It's the kind that leaves me alone 
 This is my kinda love 
 It's a crown of thorns 
 It's the kind that leaves me aloneIt's not the same without you up here 
 Can't find my wheels 
 Your absence is what breeds this fear 
 Warm breath and all it steals 
 You can't know how it feels to be in here 
 All the dark horse fields, befriendin' me 
 Playin' ain't the same without you here 
 We've come to hate the golden rule 
 Cannot seem to make the dots connect 
 The morning light don't show you near 
 You can't know what it's like to bleed from here 
 The blackened world goes white, it goes nowhere 
 Ooh Hoo... (x4) 
 Death ain't the same without you, dear 
 I make the others run and hide 
 New York streets seem to make it worse 
 All this noise inside the quiet 
 I can't hold on, the weight you bear 
 My body's broken fast, please lift me up 
 You can't know what it's like to be inside 
 Your fading melodies can't beat my need 
 I'm not the same without you here 
 How can I quit to be there 
 Sit and stare 
 Stare... 
 Begging for a prayerThere is a marker, no one sees it 'cause of sand 
 That has covered over all the messages it kept 
 From misunderstanding what original truth was 
 And now expanding in a faith, but not in love 
 What went wrong? 
 Walking tightrope high over moral ground 
 Seeing visions of falling up somehow 
 Oh do come down with the living 
 Let what is living love 
 So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first 
 God, what do you say? 
 Those undecided needn't have faith to be free 
 And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be 
 Now you got both sides claiming "Killing in God's name" 
 But God is nowhere to be found, conveniently 
 What goes on? 
 Walking tightrope high over moral ground 
 Walk the bridges before you burn them down 
 Do come round with the living 
 Let what is living love 
 Unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first 
 God, what do you say? 
 God, what do you say? 
 I feel a sickness, a sickness coming over me 
 Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea 
 And the solution? Well, from me far would it be 
 But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me 
 What goes wrong? 
 Walking tightrope high over moral ground 
 Seeing visions of falling up somehow 
 Oh, do come down with the living 
 Let what is living love, unforgiving 
 Yet needing forgiveness first 
 Oh, what do you say? 
 God, what do you say? 
 What do you say? 
 Calling out, calling out 
 Calling out, calling outSittin' in the mornin' sun 
 I'll be sittin' till the evening's done 
 Watchin' the ships roll in 
 Then I watch 'em roll away again 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Watchin' the tide roll away 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Wastin' time... 
 I left my home in Georgia 
 Headed for the Frisco Bay 
 I've got nothin' to live for 
 Looks like nothing's gonna come my way, yeah... 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Watchin' the tide roll away 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Wastin' time... 
 Looks like nothing's ever gonna change 
 Everything still remains the same 
 I can't do what ten people want me to 
 So I guess I'll remain the same, oh 
 Sittin' on a roll in my bones 
 This loneliness won't leave me alone 
 2, 000 Miles I've roamed 
 Just to make this dock my home, yeah... 
 I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Watchin' the tide roll away 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Wastin' time... 
 I left my home in Georgia 
 Headed for the Frisco Bay 
 Sittin' here restin' my bones 
 This loneliness won't leave me alone, yeah... 
 2, 000 Miles I've roamed 
 Just to make this dock my home, yeah... 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Watchin' the tide roll away 
 Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Wastin' time...I should have known there was someone else 
 Down below I always kept it to myself 
 Now I believe in nothing 
 Not today 
 As I move myself out of your sight 
 I'll be sleeping by myself tonight 
 I could never go with no one else 
 The hurt don't show, but who knows 
 Time will tell 
 Now I believe in nothing 
 But the pain 
 And I can't see this turning out right 
 Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself tonight 
 Forever be sad and lonely 
 Forever never be the same 
 I close my eyes, wait for a sign 
 Am I just waiting in vain? 
 I close my eyes, wait for a sign 
 Am I just waiting in vain? 
 Oh, I believe in love and disaster 
 Sometimes the two are just the same 
 I'm beginning to see 
 What's left of me 
 Is gonna have to be free to survive 
 I'll be sleeping by myself tonight 
 I believe in nothing 
 But the pain 
 And I can't see this turning out right 
 Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself 
 I'll be sleeping by myself 
 I'll be sleeping by myself tonightThere's a light when my baby is in my arms 
 There's a light when the window shades are drawn 
 Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her 
 Wash it off, 'cause this feeling we can share 
 And I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 Byzantine is reflected in our pond 
 There's a cloud, but the water remains calm 
 Reaching in, the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to pass 
 Even out, it's a precious thing to bear 
 And I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 Yes, I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 It's not in my past to presume 
 Love can keep on moving in both directions 
 How to be happy and true 
 Is the quest we're taking on together 
 Taking on, on, on, on, on 
 Taking on, on, on, on, on 
 There's a light when my baby's in my arms 
 And I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 And I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 And I know she's reached my heart in thin air 
 Yes, I know she's reached my heartAngel 
 Like an angel, fly over your house 
 Like an angel, pass out wishes 
 Like an angel, I remove the arrow 
 Like an angel, I live alone 
 I'm not livin' what was promised 
 I am close but can't enjoy 
 Oh, I'm not dyin' 
 Oh, I'm so tortured, 'cause I see all 
 Tortured, and all I cannot do 
 Tortured, all I should have done 
 Tortured, while I occupied a man 
 I'm not livin' what was promised 
 I am far from glorified 
 Oh, I'm not dyin' 
 Oh, I'm not alone 
 Mine is not a celestial state with idle hymns of praise 
 Time is short, I have an appointment at noon, at noon in Hell 
 Across the waste of space and fields of air I glide, alone at night 
 Oh please, please think of me, 'cause I'm, I'm by your side 
 I'm by your side, I'm by your side, oh... 
 I'm... I'm right in front of you... I'm by your side...I got an unfortunate feeling 
 I been beaten down 
 I feel that I'm done believing 
 Now the truth is coming out 
 What they're taking is 
 More than a vow 
 They're taking young innocents 
 And then they throw 'em on a burning pile, ah yea 
 And all along they're saying 
 "Mind your manners!" 
 I caught myself believing 
 That I needed God 
 And if it's out there somewhere 
 We sure could use hymn now 
 Try my patience 
 My patience tried 
 This world's a long love letter 
 That makes me want to cry, ah ah eh eh 
 And all along they're saying 
 "Mind your manners!" 
 That's all they're saying 
 Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed 
 May not live another life 
 May not solve our mystery 
 Right 'round the corner 
 Could be bigger than ourselves 
 We could will it to the sky 
 Or we could something else 
 And all along they're saying 
 "Mind your manners!" 
 Always praying 
 Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed 
 May not live another life 
 May not solve our mystery 
 Right 'round the corner 
 Could be bigger than ourselves 
 We could will it to the sky 
 Or we could something else 
 Go to heaven 
 (that's swell) 
 How you like your living in Hell? 
 Go to heaven 
 (that's swell) 
 How you like your living Hell? 
 Go to heaven 
 (that's swell) 
 How you like your living Hell?She scratches a letter 
 Into a wall made of stone 
 Maybe someday another child 
 Won't feel as alone as she does 
 It's been two years and counting 
 Since they put her in this place 
 She's been diagnosed 
 By some stupid fuck 
 And mommy agrees, yeah 
 Why go home? 
 Why go home? 
 Why go home? 
 She seems to be stronger 
 But what they want her to be is weak 
 She could play pretend 
 She could join the game, boy 
 She could be another clone 
 Ooh, ow 
 Ah, yeah

 Why?I'm questioning my education 
 Is my education all I am now? 
 While you're deciding I've been finding 
 Looking around in the here and now 
 If I'd been taught from the beginning 
 Would my fears now be winning? 
 I'm questioning my own equation 
 Is my own equation relevant somehow 
 The flags will wave and the news is breaking 
 See the man who came, forgot his own tie 
 If I'd been taught from the beginning 
 Would my fears now be winning? 
 A wild world, figured out the answers 
 I'll be in my own, dancing out, ou-out yeah 
 I'm questioning my education 
 Rewinding, what does it show? 
 Could be, the truth, it becomes you 
 I'm a seed wondering why I'm grown.1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 
 Who's got the brain of JFK? 
 What's it mean to us now, yeah? 
 Pause, it sounds distrust 
 But I can tell ya, this is no lie 
 The whole world will be different soon 
 The whole world will be relieved 
 The whole world will be different soon 
 The whole world will be relieved 
 You, you've been taught, whipped into shape 
 Now they've got you in line, eh 
 Stand behind the stripes 
 There will be order, so give up your mind 
 The whole world will be different soon 
 The whole world will be relieved 
 The whole world will be different soon 
 The whole world will be relieved 
 Lend my name 
 The name they gave me 
 The name I'm letting go 
 The whole world will be different soon

 SoonJazz, jazz, jazz 
 Experiment of jazzAll my rivals will see what I have in store 
 My gun 
 I've been harboring fleets in this reservoir 
 Red sun 
 And this nation's about to explode 
 Your disciples are riddled with metaphors 
 Well hung 
 Better pony up and bring both your barrels full 
 Not one 
 As we release this unspeakable toll, wooh 
 How's our mother to damn these contributors? 
 With mud 
 How will the man who made chemicals difficult 
 Shed blood? 
 How's our father supposed to be told? 
 I don't, ohTwo dozen other dirty 
 Oh, don't wanna be a sucker for it 
 Don't mean to cry to my mother 
 Ma, just let me come, let me come to a decision on it 
 Sooner or later 
 You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out 
 Save it for later 
 Don't run away, don't let me down

 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me downRoutine was the theme 
 He'd wake up, wash and pour himself into uniform 
 Something he hadn't imagined being 
 As the merging traffic passed 
 He found himself staring down 
 At his own hands 
 Not remembering the change 
 Not recalling the plan 
 Was it? 
 He was okay 
 But wondering 
 About wandering 
 Was it age? 
 By consequence? 
 Or was he moved by sleight of hand? 
 Mondays were made to fall 
 Lost on a road he knew by heart 
 It was like a book he read in his sleep 
 Endlessly 
 Sometimes he hid in his radio 
 Watching others pull into their homes 
 While he was drifting 
 On a line 
 Of his own 
 Off the line 
 Off the side 
 By the by 
 As dirt turned to sand 
 As if moved by sleight of hand 
 And when he reached the shore of his clip-on world 
 He resurfaced to the norm 
 Organized his few things, his coat and keys 
 Any new realizations would have to wait 
 Till he had more time 
 More time 
 A time to dream 
 To himself 
 He waves goodbye 
 To himself 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Another man moved by sleight of handAll the thoughts you never see 
 You're always thinking 
 Brain is wired, brain is deep 
 Oh, are you sinking? 
 Feel the path of every day 
 Which road you taking? 
 Breathing hard, making hay 
 Yeah, this is living 
 Look for love and evidence 
 That you're worth keeping 
 Swallowed whole in negatives 
 It's so sad and sickening 
 Feel the air up above 
 A pool of blue sky 
 Fill the air up with love 
 Oh, black with starlight 
 Feel the sky blanket you 
 With gems and rhinestones 
 See the path cut by the moon 
 For you to walk on 
 For you to walk on 
 Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left 
 Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left 
 Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left 
 See the path cut by the moon 
 For you to walk on 
 See the waves on distant shores 
 Awaiting your arrival 
 Dream the dreams of other men 
 You'll be no one's rival 
 Dream the dreams of others then 
 You will be no one's rival 
 You will be no one's rival 
 A distant time, a distant space 
 That's where we're living 
 A distant time, a distant place 
 So what you giving? 
 What you giving?You are the hole in my head 
 I am the pain in your neck 
 You are the lump in my throat 
 I am the aching in your heart 
 We are tangled 
 We are stolen 
 We are living where things are hidden 
 You are something in my eye 
 And I am the shiver down your spine 
 You are on the lick of my lips 
 I am on the tip of your tongue 
 We are tangled 
 We are stolen 
 We are buried up to our necks in sand 
 We are luck 
 We are fate 
 We are the feeling you get in the golden state 
 We are love 
 We are hate 
 We are the feeling I get when you walk away... 
 Walk away 
 You are the dream in my nightmare 
 I am that falling sensation 
 You are my needles and pins 
 I am your hangover morning 
 We are tangled 
 We are stolen 
 We are living where things are hidden 
 We are luck 
 We are fate 
 We are the feeling you get in the golden state 
 We are love 
 We are hate 
 We are the feeling I get when you walk away 
 Walk away 
 Walk away 
 You are the hole in my head 
 You are the pain in your neck 
 You are the lump in my throat 
 I am the aching in your heartI have not been home since you left long ago 
 I'm thumbing my way back to heaven 
 Counting steps walking backwards on the road 
 I'm counting my way back to heaven 
 I can't be free with what's locked inside of me 
 If there was a key you took it in your hand 
 There's no wrong or right but I'm sure there's good and bad 
 The questions linger overhead 
 No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead 
 I'm thumbing my way back to heaven 
 I wish that I could hold you, I wish that I had 
 Thinking 'bout heaven 
 I let go of the rope thinking that's what held me back 
 And in time I've realized it's now wrapped around my neck 
 I can't see what's next from this lonely overpass 
 Hang my head and count my steps as another car goes past 
 All the rusted signs we ignored throughout our lives 
 Choosing the shiny ones instead 
 I turned my back, now there's no turning back 
 Mmmmmmm 
 No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead 
 I smile, but who am I kidding? 
 I'm just walking the miles, every once in a while get a ride 
 I'm thumbing my way back to heaven 
 I'm thumbing my way back to heaven 
 I'm thumbing my way back to heavenOut here in the fields, I fight for my meals 
 I get my back into my living 
 I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right 
 I don't need to be forgiven, no no no no 
 Don't cry, don't raise your eye 
 It's only teenage wasteland

 You're God and you got big hands. 
 Colors blend... the challenges you give, man. 
 Seek my part, devote myself. 
 My small self like a book amongst the many on a shelf. 
 Sometimes I know, sometimes I rise. 
 Sometimes I fall, sometimes I don't. 
 Sometimes I cringe, sometimes I live. 
 Sometimes I walk, sometimes I kneel. 
 Sometimes I speak of nothing at all. 
 Sometimes I reach to myself, dear God.Don't be shy

 Teenage wasteland 
 It's only teenage wasteland 
 Teenage wasteland 
 (It's only) teenage wasteland 
 They're all wastedClimbing over a mountains 
 Floating out on the sea 
 Far from lights of a city 
 The elements, they speak to me 
 Whispering that life 
 Existed long before greed 
 Balancing the world 
 On its knee 
 Don't see some men as 1/2 empty 
 See them 1/2 full of shit 
 Thinking that we're all but slaves 
 There ain't gonna be 
 No middle anymore 
 It's been said before 
 The haves be having more 
 Yet still bored 
 Won't someone save? 
 Won't someone save the world? 
 World, world 
 World, worldDo you see the way that tree bends? 
 Does it inspire? 
 Leaning out to catch the sun's rays. 
 A lesson to be applied. 
 Are you getting something out of this 
 All-encompassing trip? 
 You can 
 Spend your time alone 
 Re-digesting past regrets, oh. 
 Or you can come to terms and realize, 
 You're the only one who can forgive yourself, for... 
 Makes much more sense 
 To live 
 In the present tense. 
 Have you ideas on how this life ends? 
 Checked your hands and studied the lines. 
 Have you the belief 
 That the road ahead 
 Ascends off into the light 
 Seems that needlessly 
 It's getting harder 
 To find an approach and a way to live. 
 Are we getting something out of this all-encompassing trip? 
 You can spend your time alone 
 Re-digesting past regrets, oh. 
 Or you can 
 Come to terms and 
 Realize You're the only one 
 Who cannot forgive yourself for... 
 Makes much more sense 
 To live 
 In the present tense.He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out 
 A bad time, nothing could save him 
 Alone in a corridor waiting locked out 
 He got up out of there, ran for hundreds of miles 
 He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree 
 The wind rose up, set him down on his knee 
 Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw, 
 Delivered him wings, "Hey, look at me now..." 
 Arms wide open with the sea as his floor 
 Oh - ah, oh... 
 He's - flying! Home 
 High! Wide! Home... 
 He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share 
 His key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhere 
 But first he was stripped, then he was stabbed 
 By faceless men, well... fuckers, he still stands. 
 And he still gives his love, he just gives it away 
 The love he receives is the love that is saved 
 And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky 
 A human being that was given to fly 
 Flying! Home... 
 High! Flying! Home... 
 He's Flying! Home... 
 Oh, oah... Home...Alone... 
 Listless...

 I ain't got words for all that's wrong 
 What do you say? Meditate 
 Meditate, Ole 
 What you say when they give the guy the go-ahead? 
 What you gonna say? Ole 
 What you say, what you say when your spitting up on your bed? 
 What you gonna say? Ole 
 What you say, what you say when you've had enough of knuckleheads 
 What you gonna say? Ole 
 What you say, now, what you say when you've seen enough bloodshed? 
 What you gonna say? Stop 
 I still can't help but wonder why 
 I'm feeling laughed at by the sky 
 What do you say, meditate? 
 Meditate, Ole 
 When your life ends 
 When your life ends 
 When your life endsLives opened and trashed 
 Look, Ma, watch me crash 
 No time to question 
 Why'd nothing last? 
 Grasp and hold on 
 We're dying fast 
 Soon be over 
 And I will relent 
 Let the ocean swell 
 Dissolve 'way my past 
 Three days and maybe longer 
 Won't even know I've left 
 Under your tongue 
 I'm like a tab 
 I will give you 
 What you're not s'posed to have. 
 Under my breath 
 I swear by sin 
 For better or worse 
 A best we began 
 Let the sun climb 
 Oh, burn 'way my mask 
 Three days and maybe longer 
 Shed my skin at last, shed... shed. 
 Let the sun shine 
 Burn 'way my mask 
 Three days and maybe longer 
 Won't ever find me here 
 Let the ocean 
 Dissolve 'way my past 
 Four days and not much longer 
 Let my spirit pass 
 This is, this is 
 This is, this is 
 This is, this is 
 This is, this is my last exitThis is a public service announcement 
 With guitar

 For freedom 
 Ha! 
 Maybe it's been suggested in some quarters, 
 That this is not enough 
 So get up, get up and scream, oh! 
 Get up and scream, ah oh!I shut and locked the front door 
 No way in or out 
 I turned and walked the hallway 
 And pulled the curtains down 
 I knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around 
 But nothing's sound, nothing's sound 
 I stayed where my last cap left me 
 Ignored all my rounds 
 Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls 
 They're upside down 
 I swallow my words to keep from lying 
 I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I... 
 I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving 
 I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened 
 Now... I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding 
 It's been about three days now 
 Since I've been aground 
 No longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now 
 It's funny when things change so much 
 It's all state of mind 
 I swallowed my words to keep from lying 
 I swallowed my face just to keep from biting, I, I 
 I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, I was diving 
 I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened 
 Now I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 Now I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding, yeah 
 I'm in hiding...I've just seen a face 
 I can't forget the time or place where we just met 
 She's just the girl for me 
 I want all the world to see we've met 
 Da, da, da, da-da, da... 
 Had it been another day 
 I might have looked the other way 
 Adn I'd have never been aware 
 As it is I'll dream of her tonight 
 Da, da, da, da-da, da... 
 Oh, yeah, yes I'm fallin' 
 And she keeps callin' me back again 
 (X2)Oh where oh where, can my baby be 
 The Lord took her, away from me 
 She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good 
 So I can see my baby when I leave this world 
 We were out on a date in my daddy's car 
 We hadn't driven very far 
 There in the road, straight ahead 
 A car was stalled, the engine was dead 
 I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right 
 I'll never forget, the sound that night 
 The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass 
 The painful scream that I, heard last 
 Oh where oh where, can my baby be 
 The Lord took her, away from me 
 She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good 
 So I can see my baby when I leave, this world 
 When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down 
 There were people, standin' all around 
 Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes 
 But somehow, I found my baby that night 
 I lifted her head, she looked at me and said 
 Hold me darlin', for a little while 
 I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss 
 I found the love, that I knew I had missed 
 Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight 
 I lost my love my life, that night 
 Oh where oh where, can my baby be 
 The Lord took her, away from me 
 She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good 
 So I can see my baby when I leave, this world

 Happy birthday to you 
 Happy birthday, dear [Incomprehensible] 
 Happy birthday to youHow long must she stand 
 Before the ground, it gives way 
 To an endless fall 
 She can feel this war on her face 
 The stars on her pillow 
 She's folding in darkness 
 Begging for slumber 
 I'm not blind 
 I can see it coming 
 Looks like lightning 
 In my child's eye 
 I'm not frantic 
 I can feel it coming 
 Violently shakes 
 My body 
 Her son's slanted 
 Always giving her the sideways eye 
 The empty chair where dad sits 
 How loud can silence get? 
 And mom 
 She reassures 
 To contain him 
 But it's becoming a lie 
 She tells herself 
 And anyone else 
 Father is risking 
 His life for our freedoms 
 I'm not blind 
 I can see it coming 
 Looks like lightning 
 In my child's eye 
 I'm not frantic 
 I can feel it coming 
 Darling you'll save me 
 If you save yourselfWell mom and dad said we could 
 So I did what I should 
 I hung my stocking on a wall 
 I didn't get a thing at all 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year 
 Well stayin' up late 
 To see santa clause fly 
 Well sure enough don't ya know 
 The fat boy didn't show 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year 
 Well I tried to get a little kiss 
 From a pretty little miss 
 She slapped me down and said "you jerk, 
 Mistletoe doesn't work" 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 I don't believe in christmas 
 'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year 
 Oh right! 
 Well wakin' up the reindeer 
 Makin' little kids cheer

 Santa gave him moonshine 
 I don't believe in christmas

 I don't believe in christmas 
 'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year 
 Ah decorate the street light

 I don't believe in christmas 
 'Cause I didn't get nothin' but fearNo more upset mornings 
 No more tired evenings 
 This American dream 
 I am disbelieving 
 When the gas in my tank 
 Feels like money in the bank 
 Gonna blow it all this time 
 Take me one last ride 
 For the lights of this city 
 They only look good when I'm speeding 
 I wanna leave 'em all behind me 
 'Cause this time I'm gone 
 Long gone 
 This time I'm letting go of it all 
 So long 
 'Cause this time I'm gone 
 In the far off distance 
 As my tail-lights fade 
 No one thinks to witness 
 But they will someday 
 Feel like a question is forming 
 And the answer's far 
 I will be what I could be 
 Once I get out of this town 
 For the lights of this city 
 They have lost all feeling 
 Gonna leave 'em all behind me 
 'Cause this time I'm gone 
 Long gone 
 Yeah, this time I'm letting go of it all 
 So long 
 Long gone, I'm letting go of it all 
 'Cause this time I'm gone 
 If nothing is everything 
 If nothing is everything, I'll have it all 
 If nothing is everything 
 If nothing is everything, I'll have it all 
 I am goneWatched from the window with a red mosquito, 
 I was not allowed to leave the room. 
 I saw the sun go down, and now it's comin' up, 
 Somewhere in the time between. 
 I was bitten, must have been the devil, 
 He was just payin' me a little visit, 
 A-reminding me of his presence, 
 Lettin' me know he's a-waitin' for me... 
 Red man's your neighbor, call it behavior, 
 While you're climbing up slippery hills, 
 Two steps ahead of him, punctures in your neck, 
 Hoverin' just above your bed... 
 Hoverin' just above your bed... 
 I was bitten, must have been the devil, 
 He was just payin' me a little visit, 
 A-reminding me of his presence, 
 Lettin' me know he's a-waitin', he's a-waitin' for me. 
 If I had known then what I know now...Everyone’s a critic looking back up the river 
 Every boat is leaking in this town 
 Everybody's thinking they can all be delivered 
 Sitting in a box like lost and found 
 But I found my place and it’s alright 
 We’re all searching for a better way 
 Get this off my plate. it’s alright 
 I got my own way to believe 
 Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather 
 We all could use a sedative right now 
 Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle 
 All hands on deck, sinking is the bow 
 And if you wanna have to pray, it's alright 
 We all be thinking with our different brains 
 Get yours off my plate, it's alright 
 I got my own way to believe 
 It's okay 
 Sometimes you find yourself 
 Having to put all your faith 
 In no faith 
 Mine is mine and yours won't take its place 
 Now make your getaway 
 Science says we're making love like the lizards 
 Try and say that fossils ain't profound 
 Simon says that we are not allowed to consider 
 Simon says, 
 "Stand-up. Sit-down. You're out!" 
 But I found my place and it's alright 
 Oh, bearing witness to some stranger days 
 Get yours off my plate, it's alright 
 I got my own ways to believe 
 It's okay 
 Sometimes you find yourself 
 Being told to change your ways 
 There's no way 
 Mine is mine and yours won't take its place 
 Now make your getaway, hey hey 
 It's okay 
 Sometimes you find yourself 
 Having to put all your faith 
 In no faith 
 Mine is mine and yours won't take its place 
 Now make your getaway 
 It's okay 
 Sometime you find yourself 
 Being told to change your ways 
 For Gods sake 
 Mine is mine and yours won't take its place 
 Now make your getaway 
 Now make your getawayOne, two, three, four, five against one

 And I am my father's son 
 Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath 
 And now I'm the next in line 
 Then there's dear mother, yeah Shirley 
 She's a work of art 
 Never got top dollar 
 But she gave us all our start 
 Can I get a reprieve? 
 This gene pool drowning me 
 Can I get a release? 
 I'm a volunteer amputee 
 From the moment I fail 
 I call on DNA 
 Why such betrayal? 
 Got me tooth and nail 
 Yeah, how's about one conversation 
 With nothing else left to be had? 
 With this your young long lost son 
 And his never had dear old dad 
 Oh, forget the insemination 
 And for that, I'm supposed to be glad? 
 What a pity you left us so soon 
 To climb your mountain of regret 
 Can I get a reprieve? 
 This gene pool dark and deep 
 Can I get a release? 
 Can I volunteer amputee? 
 From the moment I fail 
 I call on DNA 
 Why such betrayal? 
 I gotta set sail 
 Hoo 
 Hoo 
 All the bright lights shining 
 As you're trying to breathe in thin air 
 Cannot forget your hiding 
 Collected wounds left unhealed 
 When every thought you're thinking 
 Sinks you darker than a new moon sky 
 The far away lights rising 
 In the whites of your eyes 
 Now father, you're dead and gone 
 And I'm finally free to be me 
 Thanks for all your fucked-up gifts 
 For which I got no sympathy 
 Now I'm living in a war torn place 
 Hear the bombs, a fifth Symphony 
 Thanks for this and thanks for that 
 I gotta let go legacy 
 Can I get a reprieve? 
 This gene pool drowning me 
 Can I beg a release? 
 Can I volunteer amputee 
 From the moment I fail 
 I call on DNA 
 Why such betrayal? 
 Yeah, I gotta set sail 
 Hoo 
 Oh yeahAlone 
 Listless 
 Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room 
 A young girl 
 Violins 
 Center of her own attention, the 
 Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it 
 Tries to make her proud 
 The shades go down, it's in her head 
 Painted room 
 Can't deny there's something wrong 
 Don't call me daughter, not fit to 
 The picture kept will remind me 
 Don't call me daughter, not fit to 
 The picture kept will remind me 
 Don't call me 
 She holds the hand that holds her down 
 She will rise above 
 Ah

 The picture kept will remind me 
 Don't call me daughter, not fit to be 
 The picture kept will remind me 
 Don't call me daughter, not fit to

 Our house on fire 
 And big brother, brother tried to put the blame on me 
 Oh, little sister, you and me can rise above 
 Oh, ain't no brother - Back to back to back 
 Oh better back on 
 You use the flag as a bandage 
 Oh my big brother's a pocket hypocrisy 
 In the closet, my pleasures 'cause big brother, 
 Brother don't wanna just let me be 
 Oh, little sister, you and me can rise above

 Rose gardens open grey skies

 P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-y 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-y 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-y 
 P-r-i-v-a-c-yCome you masters of war, you that build all the guns 
 You that build the death place, you that build all the guns 
 You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks 
 I just want you to know, I can see through your masks 
 You that never done nothing, but to build and destroy 
 You play with my world, like it's your little toy 
 You put a gun in my hand, then you hide from my eyes 
 And you turn and run farther as the fast bullets fly 
 Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive 
 A world war can be won, and you want me to believe 
 But I see through your eyes, and I see through your brain 
 Like I see through the water that runs down my drain 
 You that fasten all the triggers, for the others to fire 
 Then you sit back and watch, while the death count gets higher 
 You hide in your mansion, while young people's blood 
 Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud 
 You've thrown the worst fear, that could ever be hurled 
 The fear to bring children, into this world 
 For threatenin' my baby, unborn and unnamed 
 You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins 
 How much do I know, to talk out of turn? 
 You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned 
 But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you 
 Even Jesus would never forgive what you do 
 Let me ask you one question, is your money that good? 
 Will it buy you forgiveness? do you think that it could? 
 Oh, I think you will find, when your death takes its toll 
 All the money you made will never buy back your soul 
 And I hope that you die, and your death will come soon 
 I'll follow your casket, in the pale afternoon 
 And I'll watch as you're lowered, into your deathbed 
 And I'll stand on your grave 'til I'm sure that you're deadDrifting, drifting, drifting away 
 I got myself a mansion then I gave it away 
 It's not the world that's heavy, it's just the things that you save 
 And I'm drifting, drifting away 
 Drifting, drifting, drifting along 
 I rid myself of worries and my worries were gone 
 I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog 
 I'm just drifting, drifting along 
 All the suitcoats say "there is money to be made" 
 They get so damn excited but I guess it's their way 
 My road, it may be lonely just because it's not paved 
 It's good for drifting, drifting away 
 All the suitcoats say "there is money to be made" 
 They get so damn excited but I guess it's their way 
 My road, it may be lonely just because it's not paved 
 It's good for drifting, drifting away 
 Drifting, drifting, drifting, uh huh 
 I feel like going back there but never for long 
 I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone 
 And I'm just drifting, drifting along 
 Drifting, drifting along 
 Drifting, drifting alongHave a drink they're buying 
 Bottom of bottle of denial 
 Big guy, big eye watching me 
 Have to wonder what it sees, sin 
 Progress laced with ramifications 
 Freedom's big blur, oh 
 Pull the innocent from a crowd 
 Raise those sticks them bring them down 
 If they fail to obey 
 Ah, if they fail to obey, yeah, yeah 
 For every tool they lend us 
 A loss of independence 
 I pledge my grievance to the flag 
 'Cause you don't give blood then take it back again 
 Oh, we're all deserving something more 
 Progress taste it, invest it all 
 Champagne breakfast for everyone 
 Break the innocent when they're proud 
 Raise those stakes then bring 'em down 
 If they fail to obey 
 Oh, if they fail to obey 
 Pledge your grievance to the flag 
 'Cause don't give blood then take it back again 
 Oh, we're all deserving something more 
 Have a, have a drink, drink 
 I want to breathe part of the scene 
 I want to taste everyone I see 
 I want to run when I'm up high 
 I want to run to the sea 
 I want to life to be 
 I just want to be 
 I will feel alive as long as I am freeYes, it's true... shining wine... 
 Go on leave with the morning light 
 My love, on the wing at night she rides 
 Fade away where the sun cleared out 
 Yeah... fade away... 
 Little time in this life... sometime it seems... 
 Twilight world, dark, living dream 
 Feel how... say no more, but stay, yeah... 
 The love you are, always... yeah... 
 Feel the motion with this song... 
 Like a river churnin', pullin'... 
 Oh... fade away... 
 You said, "where have you been for a hundred years?" 
 Out in the sky... you fell beneath... 
 Turnin' down a road... leads I know not where 
 Forever turnin' back, yeah... 
 Feel the motion with this song... 
 Like a river churnin', pullin'... 
 Feel the motion with this song... 
 Like a river... like an...On the edge, a windowsill 
 Ponders his maker, ponders his will 
 To the street below 
 He just ain't nothin' 
 But he's got a great view 
 And he sinks a needle deep 
 Oh, can't touch the bottom 
 In too deep, yeah 
 Oh, can't touch the bottom 
 Whoa, on the edge of a know-nothing town 
 Feeling quite superior, the aged come 
 To the sky above 
 He just ain't nothin' 
 But he's got a great view 
 And he sinks a burning knife deep 
 Can't touch the bottom 
 In too deep, yeah 
 Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom 
 In too deep 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh 
 On the edge of a Christmas clean love 
 Young virgin from Heaven, visiting 
 To the man above her 
 She just ain't nothing 
 She doesn't like the view 
 She doesn't like the view 
 She doesn't like the view 
 But he sinks himself deep, oh 
 Can't touch the bottom 
 In too deep, hey 
 Oh, can't touch the bottom, can't touch the bottom 
 Deep, yeah 
 Touch the bottom, can't 
 Touch the bottom, can't 
 Touch the bottom, can't 
 Touch the bottom, can't 
 Touch the bottom, yeah 
 OhIt's time, I came to get mine. 
 Runnin' through the hoods with a hand on the nine. 
 Why do the pigs come? 
 Bring your ass on, cross the line so I can get the blast on. 
 Oh shit, I'm empty, but I got a shank on the side so don't even tempt me. 
 Runnin' the program, Cypress Hill on the real, 
 With the Pearl Jam and I'm packin' the steel. 
 Don't come my way, 'cause it only takes one minute to reach for the AK... 
 Then POW!, whatcha' gonna do now? 
 Nowhere to run when my dog's on the prowl. 
 Prowlin', howlin', give it up punk, you might want to throw the towel in. 
 I like doin' the ill thing, 'cause ain't nothin' like the real thing. 
 It ain't nothin' like the real thing. 
 It ain't nothin' like the real. 
 Ain't nothin' but the real thing.

 Keep me a tazer up in the blazer, 
 And the black nine by the waistline. 
 Never know when someone'll test ya'. 
 Let you know I got mine by my body, yes y'all. 
 I'm the victim that became the attacker. 
 Have my little friend waitin' for the carjacker 
 That'll do anything for the looper. 
 When I leave the Hill I strack when I swoop. 
 Clack, clack, bang, bang, 'cause it ain't no thang. 
 When I hang with Stone and I kick that funky slang. 
 I got the funk when I got ta' do the ill thing. 
 'Cause ain't nothin' like the real thing. 
 Ain't nothin' like the real thing. 
 Ain't nothin' but the real. 
 Ain't nothin' like the real thing.

 Ain't nothin' but the Hill.Ah, is there room for both of us? Both of us apart? 
 Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got? 
 I get the words and then I get to thinking 
 I don't wanna think, I wanna feel 
 How do I feel? How do I? 
 If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah 
 Hail, hail the lucky ones 
 I refer to those in love, yeah 
 Oh, how I'd love you till the day I die... and beyond 
 Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come? 
 It's egg rolling, thick and heavy 
 All the past we carry 
 Oh, I could be new 
 You under-estimate me 
 If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah 
 Hail, hail the lucky ones 
 I refer to those in love, yeah 
 I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me 
 Are you woman enough to be my man? 
 Bandaged hand in hand 
 Black lining 
 On the run in a race that can't be won, yeah 
 Oh, hail, hail the lucky ones 
 I refer to those in love, yeah 
 If you're my only one 
 So good, you, only one 
 I want to be your one 
 Enough, you won, your one, your oneDon't need a helmet, got a hard, hard head 
 Don't need a raincoat, I'm already wet 
 Don't need a bandage, there's too much blood 
 After a while, seems to roll right off 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 Don't need a hand, there's always arms attached 
 I don't get behind, I can't fall back 
 Why must we trust all these rusted rails? 
 They don't want no change we already have 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 They're whipping 
 Don't mean to push, but I'm being shoved 
 I'm just like you, think we've had enough 
 I can't believe a thing they want us to 
 We all got scars, they should have them, too 
 They're whipping

 Running to? you didn't 
 Leave a message, at least I 
 Could have heard your voice one last time 
 Daily minefield, this could 
 Be my time by you 
 Would you hit me? 
 Would you hit me? 
 Oh 
 Oh, ow 
 All the bills go by and 
 Initiatives are taken up by the middle 
 There ain't gonna be any middle any more 
 And the cross I'm bearing home 
 Ain't indicative of my place 
 Left the porch 
 Left the porch, oh oh 
 Hear my name 
 Take a good look 
 This could be the day 
 Hold my hand 
 Walk beside me 
 I just need to say 
 Hear my name 
 Take a good look 
 This could be the day 
 Hold my hand 
 Lie beside me 
 I just need to say

 Touch you, hold you, feel you 
 Ever hold 
 Never again

 We are but victims of desire

 I wanna shake this pain before I retire 
 I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend 
 Make it go away 
 I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend

 Buona sera, won't be long before we 
 All walk off the wire 
 I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend 
 For what I require 
 Buona sera, cut my quick 
 Don't want my flame to get no higher

 Wanna give it up 
 Wanna see it, gone once and for all 
 Wanna feel withdrawal 
 Want an overhaul 
 Wanna be there, hard as a statue 
 Black as a tattoo, never to wash away 
 Gonna take me an astral plane 
 I'm gonna tunnel through denial 
 I'm gonna shake this thing 
 I wanna shake this pain 'fore I retire

 Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one 
 I've been blessed with the power to survive 
 After all these years I'm still alive 
 I'm out here kickin with the band 
 I am no longer a solitary man 
 Everyday my time runs out 
 Live like a fool, that's what I was about 
 Oh I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and you 
 Oh Oh I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and you 
 Tattooed your name on my arm 
 I always said my girl's a good luck charm 
 If she can find a reason to forgive 
 Then I can find a reason to live 
 I used to be on an endless run 
 Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one

 After all these years I'm still alive 
 Oh I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and you

 I believe in a better world for me and you 
 Oh I believe in miracles 
 I believe in a better world for me and youWhy deny all the troubles when combined 
 With the missing links, it don't feel like home now 
 That you're gone, all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum 
 You're always wishing and never here at home, you 
 All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on 
 But the house is getting dark 
 And I don't want to know your past 
 But together share the dawn 
 And I won't need nothing else 'cause when we're dead 
 We would've had it all 
 And I wouldn't falling from the sky, tell you 
 Parachutes have opened now 
 Heaven knows if there's a ceiling 
 Come so low with the kneeling 
 Please know that, that I got 
 All the friends I'm needing, before my lights go out 
 As the doors are closing now 
 And far away will be my home 
 And to grasp this, I don't know 
 But I don't need 
 Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today 
 And love 
 Wish the world could glow again with love 
 One can't seem to have enough 
 And war 
 Break the sky and tell me what it's for 
 I'll travel there on my own 
 And love 
 What a different life 
 Had I not found this love with youEvery beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all 
 (Han-ten outta Santa Fe when surf comes out tomorrow lets go) 
 And he's always practicing his cowabunga call (cowabunga) 
 But he'll never scramble when the big waves start to roll 
 Cause there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 Gremmie out of control 
 Gremmie out of control 
 There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 The kids always know that gremmie's talk is cheap 
 (Ride the hula-han over the pipeline bonsai to saddle bowl) 
 Oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep (cowabunga) 
 His board is always full of dings 
 'Cause he's always doing stupid things 
 And there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control 
 Gremmie out of control 
 Gremmie out of control 
 There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control

 There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of controlThere's a girl on a ledge she's got nowhere to turn 
 'Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned 
 Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern 
 She can blame the world or pray till dawn 
 But only love can break her fall 
 Break her fall 
 Yeah, only love can break her fall, fall 
 It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth 
 And she's standing outside hating everyone here 
 Yeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll 
 But only love can break her fall 
 Break her fall 
 Only love can break her fall, yeah 
 Yeah fall 
 The world is her fall, break her fall 
 Love, love, love can break her fall 
 Now only love can break her fall

 I tell myself before I go to sleep... 
 Don't say the words you might regret 
 I lost before, you know I can't forget... 
 There was a girl I used to know... 
 Well, she dealt my love a savage blow... 
 And I was so young, too blind to see... 
 But anyway, that's history... 
 And I say, history never repeats 
 I tell myself before I go to sleep... 
 And there's a light shining in the dark 
 Leading me on towards a change of heart... 
 You say I always play the fool... 
 I can't go on if that's the rule... 
 Better to jump than hesitate... 
 I need a change and I can't wait... 
 I say... history never repeats 
 I tell myself before I go to sleep... 
 And there's a light shining in the dark 
 Leading me on towards a change of heart... heart... 
 Never repeats... whoa... 
 History never repeats 
 History never re... 
 Deep in the night it's all so clear... 
 I lie awake with great ideas... 
 Lurking about in no man's land... 
 I think at last I understand... 
 History never repeats 
 I tell myself before I go to sleep... 
 And there's a light shining in the dark 
 Leading me on towards a change of heart... 
 Yeah!Olympic dream, olympic dream... 
 If I could reach to the sky and touch it for my country 
 Get some on my finger and take in its smell 
 The smell of victory, land of the free, olympic dream, olympic dream 
 Olympic theme 
 My olympic dream 
 My promotion scheme 
 How hard can it be 
 How high can I jump 
 How high can I throw 
 How high can I run (I'm running very fast) 
 How long can I hold my breath and stay underwater 
 And wave my legs around in perfect unison with my partner who doesn't really understand me 
 For my olympic dream, my olympic dream 
 I'll be like dwight stone 
 I'll be like bruce jenner 
 I'll be like that girl who trained all her life as a distance runner and then tripped with a quarter mile to go 
 But i... I will get up and I will run 
 I will run with the georgia peach breeze and i... I will win 
 I will win my... my olympic dream 
 My olympic dream 
 The gold's just not good enough 
 And I don't even think of the bronze 
 I'm living my life for olympic platinum 
 Olympic dream, my olympic theme 
 I'll sing like whitney (sing like whitney) 
 My olympic dreamI was born in a pool, they made my mother stand 
 And I spat on that surgeon and his trembling hand 
 When I felt the light I was worse than bored 
 I stole the doctor's scalpel and I slit the cord 
 I was a Catholic boy, 
 Redeemed through pain, 
 Not through joy 
 I was two months early they put me under glass 
 I screamed and cursed their children when the nurses passed 
 Was convicted of theft when I slipped from the womb 
 They led me straight from my mother to a cell in the Tombs 
 Repeat Refrain 
 They starved me for weeks, they thought they'd teach me fear 
 I fed on cellmates' dreams, it gave me fine ideas 
 When they cut me loose, the time had served me well 
 I made allies in heaven, I made comrades in Hell 
 I was a Catholic child 
 The blood ran red 
 The blood ran wild 
 I make angels dance and drop to their knees 
 When I enter a church the feet of statues bleed 
 I understand the fate of all my enemies 
 Just like Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane 
 (Repeat Refrain) 
 I watched the sweetest psalm stolen by the choir 
 I dreamed of martyrs' bones hanging from a wire 
 I make a contribution, I get absolution 
 I make a resolution to purify my soul 
 Repeat Refrain 
 They can't touch me now 
 I got every sacrament behind me: 
 I got baptism, 
 I got communion, 
 I got penance, 
 I got extreme unction 
 I've got confirmation 
 'Cause I'm a Catholic child 
 The blood ran red 
 The blood ran wild! 
 Now I'm a Catholic man 
 I put my tongue to the rail whenever I can.I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off 
 I wish I was a sacrifice, but somehow still lived on 
 I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on 
 The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top 
 I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds 
 For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky 
 I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me 
 I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me 
 I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good 
 I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaro's hood 
 I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun 
 I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on 
 I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on 
 I wish I was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down 
 I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up 
 I wish... 
 I wish...Come gather 'round people 
 Wherever you roam 
 And admit that the waters 
 Around you have grown 
 And accept it that soon 
 You'll be drenched to the bone. 
 If your time to you 
 Is worth savin' 
 Then you better start swimmin' 
 Or you'll sink like a stone 
 For the times they are a-changin'. 
 Come writers and critics 
 Who prophesize with your pen 
 And keep your eyes wide 
 The chance won't come again 
 And don't speak too soon 
 For the wheel's still in spin 
 And there's no tellin' who 
 That it's namin'. 
 For the loser now 
 Will be later to win 
 For the times they are a-changin'. 
 Come senators, congressmen 
 Please heed the call 
 Don't stand in the doorway 
 Don't block up the hall 
 For he that gets hurt 
 Will be he who has stalled 
 There's a battle outside and its ragin'. 
 Will soon shake your windows 
 And rattle your walls 
 For the times they are a-changin'. 
 Come mothers and fathers 
 Throughout the land 
 And don't criticize 
 What you can't understand 
 Your sons and your daughters 
 Are beyond your command 
 Your old road is 
 Rapidly again (g)'. 
 Please get out of the new one 
 If you can't lend your hand 
 For the times they are a-changin'. 
 The line it is drawn 
 The curse it is cast 
 The slow one now 
 Will later be fast 
 As the present now 
 Will later be past 
 The order is 
 Rapidly fadin'. 
 And the first one now 
 Will later be last 
 For the times they are a-changin'.Keep on locking your doors 
 Keep on building your floors 
 Keep on just as before 
 Pay disasters no mind 
 Didn't get you this time 
 No prints left at the crime 
 Our ship's come in and it's sinking 
 Of everything that's possible 
 In the hearts and minds of men 
 Somehow it is the biggest things 
 That keep on slipping right through our hands 
 By thinking we're infallible 
 We are tempting fate instead 
 Time we best begin 
 Here at the ending 
 Wanna third second chance 
 Put your faith in big hands 
 Pay no more than a glance 
 All good things come to an end 
 This could be good as it gets 
 How's the view from the fence? 
 You think we been here before 
 You are mistaken 
 Of everything that's possible 
 In the hearts and minds of men 
 When progress could be plausible 
 In reverse we curse ourselves 
 By thinking we're infallible 
 We are tempting fate instead 
 Time we best begin 
 Here at the ending 
 Of everything that's possible 
 In the hearts and minds of men, ay yeah 
 Somehow it is the biggest things 
 That keep on slipping right through our hands, yeah 
 By thinking we're infallible 
 Oh, we are tempting fate instead

 Yeah lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yeah. 
 Use your arms to squeze and please cause that's the way it has to be.

 Suppose I abused you, just passing it on 
 Go

 Don't go on me 
 Please, don't go on meI felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet 
 In the form of a morning paper laid out for me to see 
 Saw his face in a corner picture, I recognised the name 
 Could not stop staring at the face I'd never see again 
 It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
 What does it mean when a war has taken over? 
 It's the same everyday in a hell manmade 
 What can be saved and who will be left to hold her? 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face 
 That the president took for granted, writing checks that others pay 
 And in all the madness, thought becomes numb and naive 
 So much to talk about, nothing for to say 
 It's the same every day and the wave won't break 
 Tell you to pray, while the devil's on their shoulder 
 Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save 
 Does not equate and the truth's already out there 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 Looking in the eyes of the fallen 
 You got to know there's another, another, another, another, another way 
 It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
 What does it mean when a war has taken over? 
 It's the same everyday and the wave won't break 
 Tell you to pray while the devil's on their shoulder 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicide 
 The whole world, world over 
 It's a world wide suicideI will light a match this morning so I won't be alone 
 Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone 
 Oh, I will stand arms outstretched, pretend I'm free to roam 
 Oh, I will make my way through one more day in Hell 
 How much difference does it make? 
 How much difference does it make? 
 I will hold the candle until it burns up my arm 
 Oh, I'll keep taking punches until their will grows tired 
 Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind 
 Hey, I won't change direction and I won't change my mind 
 How much difference does it make? 
 How much difference does it make? 
 I'll swallow poison until I grow immune 
 I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room 
 How much difference? 
 How much difference? 
 How much difference does it make? 
 How much difference does it make?Don't feel like home 
 He's a little out 
 And all these words alone 
 Is nothing like your poem 
 Putting in, inputting in 
 Don't feel like methadone 
 A scratching voice all alone 
 It's nothing like your baritone 
 It's nothing as it seems 
 The little that he needs, it's home 
 The little that he sees 
 Is nothing he can seize, it's home 
 One uninviting chromosome 
 A blanket like the ozone 
 It's nothing as it seems 
 All that he needs is home 
 The little that he frees 
 Is nothing he believes 
 Saving it for a sunny day 
 Something maybe, two tone 
 Anything of his own 
 A chip off the corner stone 
 Who's kidding? Rainy day 
 A one way ticket headstone 
 An occupation's overthrown 
 A whisper through a megaphone 
 It's nothing as it seems 
 The little that he needs, it's home 
 The little that he sees 
 Is nothing he concedes, it's home 
 And all that he frees 
 A little bittersweet, it's home 
 It's nothing as it seems 
 The little that he sees, it's homeShe comes on like a stone 
 But you don't know where from she was thrown 
 Like a burning meteor from miles high 
 Looking for a place to land 
 She said, 
 "Have you got yourself some sand?" 
 And whatever you replied, she took as yes 
 Now she comes after thee 
 With her newly planted seeds and soon 
 You're prone down on your knees and there you dig 
 And then before you know the weeds are 
 Obesely overgrown with all the 
 Wild seed she sows in your sleep 
 You gotta know you'll never let her go 
 She's a lightning bolt 
 Lightning bolt 
 Lightning bolt 
 Always something and never nothing 
 Isn't that the way we're taught to be? To be? 
 Flipping through the worn out pages 
 And stages when you knew not who to be 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Until the lightning strike sets you free, yeah 
 You gotta know you'll never let her go 
 She's a lightning bolt 
 Lightning bolt 
 Lightning bolt 
 Crashing stormy waves erode her 
 Shoreline everyday until the 
 Castle of her ways turns to sand 
 She holds her lovely breast 
 As her birds fall from the nest 
 Flying towards the great northwest, yeah yeah yeah 
 And with no repair in sight 
 There is no God with such might 
 As to open her world wide with subterfuge 
 And your death will soon arrive 
 As she finally decides 
 That all her problems, they won't die with you 
 Ay yeah 
 Ay yeah 
 Ay yeah 
 Never let her go 
 She's your lightning bolt 
 Never let her go 
 She's true 
 She's your rock hey oh 
 She's a lightning bolt 
 Uncontrollable like you
