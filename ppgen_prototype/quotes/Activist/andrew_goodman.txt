The road to freedom must be uphill, even if it is arduous and frustrating.
A people must have dignity and identity.
The current neglect of the problem can only irritate this deplorable state of affairs. The Black Muslims should constitute a warning to our society, a warning that must be heeded if we are to preserve the society.
Whoever moves into a community has a vested interest in it.
