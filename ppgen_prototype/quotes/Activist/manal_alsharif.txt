Saudi Arabian,Activist
The rain begins with a single drop.
All I did was ask for rights. I didn't attack anyone. I didn't harass anyone. I didn't oppose the system or the country or the authority. All I said is, 'Why can't I drive?'
It took me a long, long time to break the chains that's inside me.
When women break that taboo and they're not afraid to drive that car by herself - that's it. Now she has the guts to speak up for herself and take action.
We won't stop until the first Saudi license is issued to a woman.
Women tell me they are different since 21 May - the day I was arrested - it's a positive change, they believe now.
Women want to drive and they are taking actual steps towards that.
