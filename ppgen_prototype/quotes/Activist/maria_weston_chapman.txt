Let us rise in the moral power of womanhood; and give utterance to the voice of outraged mercy, and insulted justice, and eternal truth, and mighty love and holy freedom.
Grudge no expense - yield to no opposition - forget fatigue - till, by the strength of prayer and sacrifice, the spirit of love shall have overcome .
We may draw good out of evil; we must not do evil, that good may come.
Slavery can only be abolished by raising the character of the people who compose the nation; and that can be done only by showing them a higher one.
