Russian,Activist
We will not leave this place until our comrades are free. We are the power here. We are the power.
The harder they resist us, the tougher will be our response.
We will defend ourselves, and we have full rights to do so. If the authorities try to destroy us, we have the right to rise up. Sooner or later this will happen.
