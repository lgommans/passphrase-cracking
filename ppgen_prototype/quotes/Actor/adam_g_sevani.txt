Dancing is something I do. Not something I just want to do. It's something I just do, depending on how I'm feeling. I don't see myself taking that as just a job.
I like that whole cop-comedy type of drama.
I dug up my dad's old Fred Astaire tapes, and now I find him super-inspiring. He's, like, one of the best dancers.
Vegas is kind of crazy because there's so much going on. Everyone goes there to be entertained.
I've never seen a single episode of 'So You Think You Can Dance.'
