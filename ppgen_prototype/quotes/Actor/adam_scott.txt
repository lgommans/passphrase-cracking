American,Actor
You know, writing is really difficult, and it takes a real patience and a skill. I don't know if I have that. I admire it in others, so much, and I envy it.
You know, it looks like I have a varied resume or a varied career, that I've made interesting choices, when the truth of the matter is, in a way I've just kind of piece-mealed a career together, you know?
I would be horrified to watch whatever I was doing on 'Party Of Five.' I'm sure I'm bad on it.
I mean, the acting school I went to, we did have a social experience, but you know, when it's a bunch of actors, it's everyone self-consciously having a social experience rather than just having a social experience.
Journalism classes would have been interesting to me.
If I'm going to be away from my family, I'd rather it be working with my friends.
And if you get caught up in combing the Internet for what people think of you or how people perceive you, I think that's a slippery slope.
I mean, I love action films, you know, good action films.
It is not like casting me in your movie is going to help you get financing.
I think 'Eastbound & Down' is one of the great television shows, ever.
'Step Brothers' itself, when I did it, I don't know if I had any idea that it would become a defining moment in my career and life like it has, and I'm really happy that that's the one that ended up being that for me.
I tend to be a little too old to feel guilty about watching anything. Like, I watch 'Survivor' every week.
Like, on the 'Parks And Rec' set, I still feel like I'm a guest star. Being a fan of the show, it's really surreal to be on the set and see that it's not real, and getting to know the actors and they're not their characters.
