American,Actor
Personally, I just tease people a lot.
By Googling myself, I'm not going to find anything I like.
I have a wife, a son, and I've had some practical life experience.
I'm not homophobic.
Actually I do support a charity, DefendersofWildLife.org. They help protect endangered species.
I was a professional dancer before I was an actor.
I used to beg for auditions. Now, they're being thrown at me.
I can be a horrible actor, but I make a move that makes a money I'm secured a job.
Girls are telling me to take my shirt off. It's like, 'Hello! I'm a person, too!'
I would hate to be immortal forever.
It's like this - because I travel so much, I crave certain foods or certain things, like from certain places that I've been.
My definition of sexy is someone who is expressing themselves honestly.
I talk too much.
I'm just always grateful when I meet fans.
I'm sure every film it's going to be like, 'Okay, this is the scene where your shirt gets ripped off.' I'll never be able to keep my shirt on.
I love bad boys. They're the most fun to play.
Why would you want someone who is conflicted and doesn't know if they love you or not?
I think it started since I was born, I always had a need to express myself, you know, as a human being, and I found that it felt right when I expressed myself through art, dance, through acting, so it kind of happened naturally.
