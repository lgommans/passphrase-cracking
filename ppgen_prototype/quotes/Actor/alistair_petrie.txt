English,Actor
I think, primarily, we love spy thrillers, and I think, instinctively, we love the tension that those thrillers can bring.
I really love all sport. I watch sports when I can, but when push comes to show, I think I know it's entertainment.
Pete Moffat writes crime conspiracy thrillers so beautifully. He goes places other people wouldn't; he is fearless.
I never get obsessed with ratings, partly because the Channel series 'Utopia,' which I did, had small ratings but a passionate following, which allowed a second series.
If you watch the scroll at the very start of 'A New Hope,' you'll see plenty of references to the story we tell in 'Rogue One.' And I play a rebel General.
