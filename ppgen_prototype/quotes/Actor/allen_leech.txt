Irish,Actor
People's minds are overloaded with information.
I remember running up to my dad and saying, 'I want to be an actor when I grow up!' And him saying, 'Yeah, well we'll talk about it.'
Maggie Smith is an amazing woman, and not as serious in real life.
I never get recognised.
I'm actually just an actor.
