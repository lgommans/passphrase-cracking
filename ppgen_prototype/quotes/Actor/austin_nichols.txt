I believe in the healing power of the arts, and whenever anyone can bring art into anyone's life, it's a special thing.
On Saturday mornings, because I'm surfing a lot for the part in 'John From Cincinnati,' I'll get up about 5:30 A.M .and go to Malibu and surf. There's something very therapeutic and healing about it.
I've watched directors since my very first day of acting because I knew I wanted to direct.
It's really sad down there. Everyone's sitting around asking to help and BP won't let anybody do anything. People are coming down to help. People want to help.
L.A. is such a car-driven city, and it's great to see so many people - I think people are hungry to get on their bikes and get out of their cars and get off of oil and save money and save the environment.
