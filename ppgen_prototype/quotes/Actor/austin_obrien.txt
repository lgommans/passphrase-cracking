American,Actor
I do get to have my normal childhood. I just love to get together with my friends and family and have a good time.
I know I need to watch myself because I don't want anyone to think I'm snobby or stuck up. I have to be real careful. I don't want to hurt my Christian witness.
I really believe God has put me in the entertainment business, and he's taken real good care of me along the way. I want to do all I can to give him all the credit.
