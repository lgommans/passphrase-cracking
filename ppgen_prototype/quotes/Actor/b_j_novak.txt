There's not many good comedies to watch - you know, comedies that make you glad you watched them.
I do not have very much office experience.
Travel is impossible, but daydreaming about travel is easy.
Good comics gravitate to each other; you know who's your type of person by watching them onstage, hopefully.
The most exciting thing I aspire to do is to write something new that I know is going to work, or perform something that I know is going to make people laugh.
I'm a believer in trusting the director.
Different people have different styles, but there is an opportunity as a director to be a writer in every moment, with every visual cue and every piece of production design. Everything is a decision, and everything can be obsessed over.
'The Office' is less a comedy than so many other 'comedies' that have been on the air. It's really about the balance between what is real and what is comic.
I wanted to be a writer first, and I struck out in the world to be a writer first, and then found stand-up as a more creative outlet, as a 3D way to be creative.
