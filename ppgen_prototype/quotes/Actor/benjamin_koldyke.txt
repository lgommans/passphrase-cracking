From a male perspective, you don't think about how much outward pressure and importance you put on how women look.
The pressure is on the women to be particularly small, and then not only that, the whole package. It's extreme.
My general sensibility is most certainly comedic. But when I signed with my manager, he said, 'I think you could do dramatic stuff as well.' So, rather than making the choice to do it, I sort of agreed and deferred. By no means does it feel close to home, but I was willing to explore it.
The panty-line thing shouldn't be a big deal. I think we should just all agree that panty lines are OK. Because the thong thing is... just uncomfortable.
