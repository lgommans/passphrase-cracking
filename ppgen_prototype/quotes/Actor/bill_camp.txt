American,Actor
I learn about history and religion and politics. It keeps me tuned in. If I hear something on the news, I'm like, 'Oh my God, this is what somebody is talking about in the play that I'm about to do in two hours.' The act itself - of rehearsing, failing, and still persisting and trying to create - keeps me curious, keeps me searching.
Fortunately, I get asked to play - regardless of how big or small they are - some really interesting people who are part of great stories. So, as an actor, there's really nothing better.
When the scenes are written really great, we as actors try not to mess them up by getting in the way.
To be a police officer in New York requires so much more than just we, as a citizen, need to walk around. Your job is to put yourself in this place where a horrible event has happened and try to figure it out. That's what you do, day in and day out. You have to have a certain distance to it. You can't let yourself go too far into it.
