Every day is a surprise. There are confirmations of an interconnectivity and synchronicity which inspire, titillate and confirm the inherent comedy of the universe.
For me it's always about first impressions. I trust my instincts. I love to prepare if it's something that requires training. But I don't like to prepare the psychology too much. I enjoy the psychology of the character but I work better from a first impression.
I paint abstract expressions.
A wig is a wig is a wig.
My best evenings are at home with my lady.
I'm enjoying 40. Old enough to know better, young enough not to care.
With me it's always about first impressions.
I trust my instincts.
I love to prepare if it's something that requires training. But I don't like to prepare the psychology too much.
