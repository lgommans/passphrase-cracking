I really love to run, and then right after, get some good lifting in. Then, of course, follow all that up with some healthy meals and protein.
In junior high, I was picked on for being the small skinny kid who enjoyed being in drama. All the drama kids, we were looked at like we were aliens, and people would call us names and say, you know, 'It's stupid to be in drama.' They would say a lot worse things, to be honest.
I take my hair, and I just play with it. I'll just take my hand, I'll mess with the front, and then I'll just pat it on the back, and that's it. I promise you, I don't use hair spray, I don't go crazy with products. I just wake up, flip it, and boom, I go bowling.
In Miami, I was studying improv as well as acting. Improv is a great tool to have, just for the comedic timing that you get. When I moved to L.A., I started taking classes with The Groundlings, and I loved it. I'm definitely in love with improv and comedy.
I've written poetry since I was a kid. As the years went on, I got into writing stories and screenplays, but I always, always kept up with poetry as well.
The second that I watched 'Glee' with my brother, I loved it. I fell in love with it and I saw myself there.
