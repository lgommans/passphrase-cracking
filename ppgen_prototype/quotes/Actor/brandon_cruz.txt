I feel that it's the music, not anything else, that matters.
The crew knew because they had heard from other people, and when I showed up on the set the next day, they were all looking at me kind of weird. I told them that Bill always taught me that whenever something bad like that happens, the best thing to do is work.
You could not even pay anyone to say something bad about Bill.
I could walk and swim at 10 months old.
Surfboards were everywhere. When I got my first new board, I was probably in kindergarten.
I get to surf every day.
New York and New Jersey are probably two of my favorite places to get really good surf in the summertime.
