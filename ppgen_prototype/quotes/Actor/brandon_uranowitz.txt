It was magical growing up in New Jersey. My sister and I would go nuts in the basement and do full theater productions. We used a humidifier as a fog machine. It was over the top.
I started doing theater at the age of six. I also took tap and jazz lessons. I refused to take ballet, which is one of my biggest regrets to this day.
My dad doesn't like to admit it, but he's the ultimate stage dad. He likes to see himself as my manager even though he's not. I tell him to calm down at least twice a week. The day of the Tony nominations, I honestly thought he was having a heart attack.
I worked at Barney's selling clothes to lonely, rich white women. Every time I would look down on myself - hating my job, hating my life - I would think, 'It's a character study. Study these people, and you'll have your SNL audition ready in, like, five minutes.'
I have always been fascinated by fashion. I never had any interest in waiting tables or bar-tending, so retail was sort of my best option.
I still find new things every night, which is the beauty and fun of live theater. It's a living, breathing art form.
