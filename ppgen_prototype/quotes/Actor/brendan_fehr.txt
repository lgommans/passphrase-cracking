I never liked group work in school.
I do have a lucky pair of underwear.
I love hockey, and I don't love it for any other reason than when I get out there and play, I enjoy it.
Just because you have teenagers in a movie doesn't make it a teen movie.
The best roles have risks... and those are the parts I'm interested in.
I'm not a big fan of rehearsing.
I'm really shy with my acting when it's off, because the camera gives me an excuse to be in character, whereas otherwise I would just feel like an idiot.
You'll never see a good performance out of me, in terms of a character, when the camera isn't rolling.
When you get pure joy out of 'being' rather than 'doing' or 'seeing', that's when you realize how big and unexplainable some things are and being a dad is one of those very few things.
