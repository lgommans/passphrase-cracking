I don't read Science Fiction.
I don't read fiction at all.
I'm an avid biography reader.
Having spent so much time in a fictional world, I prefer to read about the real world.
If I'm not mistaken, I think Data was the comic relief on the show.
Yes, Data is hairless but I am not. And we are both anatomically correct.
My own personal favorite Cher song is the unforgettable Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves.
People think that being on Star Trek is career suicide, but it's really just the opposite.
Radical surgery is never fun.
And, you know, when you are a kid, everybody wants to be an actor. I think that everybody wants to be in show business, frankly.
If you look around at the people in show business today they are basically the people who didn't give up.
I think it's the business part of the word show business that causes me the most concern.
There is no question that everybody who works in show business is lucky because of the number of people who wish they where working in show business.
Acting is acting.
I think he is an extremely accessible character. In Data there is no potential for cruelty.
I think the potential for man is so enormous, if we can stay alive long enough, we're going to be seeing a lot of what Star Trek is projecting.
And I think it's likely that there will be Data's out there one day. I hope so, if there are, that they all look exactly like me!
