American,Actor
If you really want to see something scary, turn on the nightly news. To me, for people to say 'look at the films' is ludicrous. The world we live in needs to change.
When I showed up at UH, my hair was past my waist. I had a goatee. I wasn't a theater geek; I wasn't an actor. But Cecil Pickett molded me and taught me.
I find that the more I give back, the more comes to me.
