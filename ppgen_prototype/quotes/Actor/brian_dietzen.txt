American,Actor
I'm not around real dead people all that often - most people aren't - but when you are, you tend to be very, very respectful and quiet, and people do tend to whisper 'cause you're trying to show massive amounts of respect, but if this is your daily life, you have to figure out a way to go about it and not go insane by the time you reach Friday.
I love dancing, but I'm not that good of a singer. I sang in punk rock bands in high school and college and stuff, but that mostly involved lots of screaming.
I can't even tell you how many different shows I would love to guest star on because there's just too many.
I think that an actor who is working should be a happy actor.
I get a lot of advice from Mark Harmon, and I take it all to heart because I respect the heck out of him.
That's what my dad always said. 'If you're very lucky, it'll work out.' I love what it is I do, and I realize how blessed I am. So now it's just about doing the work as good as possible and enjoying the ride.
I am really blessed and fortunate to be on 'NCIS.' I really enjoy it, and I really enjoy the cast and all my friends that I have on set. With that said, I grew up doing theater and went to University of Colorado in Boulder and absolutely fell in love with theater.
