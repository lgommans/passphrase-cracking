American,Actor
After all these years, I'm starting to learn what a good director does, and I know what a good one does with actors: help us navigate finer instincts, help us when we're wrong, encourage us when things are great.
I don't think I'd ever get typecast as a soldier.
You get a feeling about things, and if you trust yourself, which I've grown to do, I felt like I had a pretty good indication of how to play the role.
I think about 'The Hurt Locker,' and we made a film about three guys, three different looking guys with three very different energies.
