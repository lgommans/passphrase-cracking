Sometimes the best thing you could do is a real bad film... you could improvise all over the place and probably only improve the script.
The artist must continue to look for a new reference. Every day, every performance, every take.
Acting is an art form. If you are not creating something that's unusual and informative and at least has the possibility of being illuminating, then you are not into it as an art form.
