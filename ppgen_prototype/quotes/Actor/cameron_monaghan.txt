I never really do the New Year's Resolution thing. I kind of just try to stay focused, not get too distracted, and do the best I can. And that's something I like to tell myself every year around New Year's.
You can't just look at someone and guess their sexuality. There's no point in assuming that every gay man has just one personality type.
I think the gay community, just like anybody, should be represented in all forms and all types.
I grew up watching movies and television, and one day when I was really young I told my mom I wanted to become an actor, and she was really supportive and got me involved in local theater and commercials. From there I moved up to auditioning for movies and television.
I love puppies, and I love animals in general. Besides that, I do martial arts: extreme martial arts. I also play real guitar and drums, and sing. And I'm taking some college classes, hoping to major in English and creative writing.
With Scarlett Johansson, I always thought she was pretty, but then when I heard her sing, there was just something about her voice that made her really, really attractive to me. And I think she would be fun to hang out with.
The thing about being an actor is that you're acting. It's not that big of a deal of to play someone different from yourself.
One of my favorite movies of all time is 'Fargo.'
I play drums and guitar, I snowboard, I do martial arts and acrobatics. I go to the movies every Friday.
'Prom' is a movie that follows a bunch of high-schoolers' lives leading up to the prom, the climax of the movie. It focuses all their struggles and the social pressures that prom creates on their lives.
I do play the guitar, and I can sing, but just enough to carry a tune.
I was home-schooled for my entire high school experience, so I never went to prom.
I really enjoy dancing. When there's music around, I can't help it; I start dancing, especially when I'm with friends.
