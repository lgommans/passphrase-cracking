Personally I'm obsessive-compulsive about the placement and cleanliness of my things.
There are always those 'Gossip Girl' walk-and-talk scenes where you're walking and just talking about life and death. You're having a serious conversation, looking someone in the eye, but everywhere around you, it's literally a circus.
I hated modeling.
Doubt your doubts before you doubt your beliefs.
New York's a big playground. I have a bike, and I'm really into just being outside. Especially in the summertime.
I went into broadcast journalism. I loved every class I took, I just got anxious because I came to the realization that you're groomed in high school to get good SAT scores to get into a good college or else you're done for.
My perfect first date? Maybe a concert or a football game. That would be my ideal first date, but would the girl like it? I don't know.
Really, I'm pretty laid-back, always cracking jokes.
