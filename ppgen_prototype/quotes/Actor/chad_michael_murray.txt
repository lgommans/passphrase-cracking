When you realize you're alive, you can live life!
I have a really, really great girl in my life right now.
I want to get to a point in my career where I can be a role model. A good one. I want to say, 'I got here without drugs, and I got here without drinking or smoking. If I can do it, you can do it. I have no doubt.' I really want kids to have a chance in life.
To all the girls out there who think being funny is not sexy, you are wrong!
I'm just happy. I'm just me right now.
I just want to be healthy and happy. I don't want to hurt anybody or make them mad. If that's a philosophy then that's my philosophy.
I never have actually had a girl who's made me laugh before.
I have a necklace around my neck that my lady gave me, so I try never to leave home without that.
Imagine you are walking along, and you trip over something and you turn around and find that it is a huge diamond. You would pick it up and do everything in your power to take care of that diamond because it might take care of you for the rest of your life.
Sophomore year, I got hit in the stomach playing football, and I was out of school for four months. I was in the hospital for two and then out of school for two.
I was always an entertainer.
I idolize my father. I mean, he has worked so hard in his life.
I've been going on Twitter every week going, 'Guys, you have to watch '2 Broke Girls' because it's incredible.
I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to be married.
I had my two front teeth knocked out by a sixth grader in first grade.
I hated high school. I didn't have any friends because I didn't fit in.
A guy friend and I went to California Pizza Kitchen, and a group of pretty girls came over to us and said, 'You guys are gay, right?'
