American,Actor
The saddest thing in life is wasted talent and the choices you make will shape your life forever.
I like playing roulette, I like dice. I grew up with gamblers.
Yeah, I like to gamble.
I'm very proud of being Italian-American, but people don't realize that the mafia is just this aberration. The real community is built on the working man, the guy who's the cop, the fireman, the truck driver, the bus driver.
I love people who just started making movies - first-timers, second-timers. They take chances.
I've always been successful. Now I'm famous and successful.
My mother and father told me I was god. I was a good Italian boy who hung out with the same four guys. I was a little god.
Italian-Americans are not the Mafia.
I always knew I was going to make it, without doubt.
My mom was Sicilian, my dad was Sicilian. Mom was a great cook, but all the women were.
Mental violence is as bad as physical violence. You don't see that very often in movies, so it was a good subject to tackle.
I get the beginning. I get the end. Then I write the middle. That's how I do it.
I came here knowing nobody. I worked clubs as a singer and even the doors a few times before I landed some TV roles.
