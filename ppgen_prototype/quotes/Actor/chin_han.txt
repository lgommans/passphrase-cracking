Roland Emmerich is a very interesting individual. He is more erudite and well-read than most of the people I know.
When I was shooting 'The Dark Knight,' I always felt like I was shooting an intimate drama for some reason. The scenes were all intimate, and they were always between a few individuals.
'Dark Knight' shot in London and Chicago, and we were on that for so long.
We live in a time where there's a great deal of navel-gazing with the devices that we have that occupy so much of our time... many subjects of history are lost.
I got to act with my childhood film idol, Robert Redford, and that's a gift in itself.
