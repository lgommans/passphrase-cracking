American,Actor
My first real kiss was actually on the set of 'The Vampire's Assistant' with Jessica Carlson who plays my crush in the movie. I was 15, she was 14. It was actually her first kiss too, so it was an interesting situation!
I love Taco Bell. Whenever I go there, I could get anything on the menu and be totally happy.
I don't really think I feel pressured to become a teen sensation because that's not really my goal in life. It's not really about being star, being popular or having lots of girls. It's really about continuing to be able to act and have fun, and do what I like to do.
I can't sing, so... I don't know if I will be doing any musicals.
I actually had a dream that one of my friends became president, and I was trying to help out with the campaign. It was pretty good.
I did a movie called 'The Hole' with this kid Nathan Gamble, so when I'm old and wrinkly, he could play me. He's awesome.
The spookiest thing for me is when I think I see something, and then nothing is there. I always imagine I see something, or I'll catch movement out of the corner of my eye, but nothing is really there.
I live in Minnesota. Lots of people assume that if you want to be an actor, you have to live in Hollywood, but not me.
