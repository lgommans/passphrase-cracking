I don't think they'd ever make a movie about Chuck Baker but I'd love to play Chuck Baker.
Having started out in theatre, I feel an impulse to do it as much as I can.
The best roles you have to fight for. You have to really want to do it and you have to go after it.
What we do as actors is we go through phases where you superficially learn all this information.
There's a lot of comedy in Intermission but it's got this depth. It's not comedy for comedy's sake - it's informed by something else. I like stuff like that.
Then I wanted the character to be feminine as opposed to effeminate. Because it's easy to be camp or queen. Anyone can do that. What's difficult is to play feminine.
My wife can see always how a part affects me personally because she has to live with it.
It's obvious that if you're going to play a character you need to amass information about that person and about their environment or their era that they're in and use as little or as much as necessary.
It was very much about performances, the whole ensemble thing was just great - everybody working together. Sometimes it didn't feel like a film set. It wasn't technically driven, it was very, very enjoyable.
I'd love to work in America, some of my favourite films come from America.
I enjoy all aspects of it, I don't have a preference for any medium. I think each of them has its attractions and I would hope they each inform the other in some way.
I don't have a burning passion to live in America per se but I would certainly like to work there.
At the moment I'm doing this space movie, so I'm obsessed with physics and space travel. I know three months down the line it's gone. Then I'll be able to superficially say stuff about space.
