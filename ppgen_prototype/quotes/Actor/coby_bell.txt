My dad is a singer, so it was always either music or acting with me. All the way up through college I was doing both, and even after college I was in a reggae band. Then the acting really started taking off, so the music had to become a hobby.
I've done a lot of drama in my career, but I'm actually more comfortable doing comedy.
I've been really lucky to get on shows that stay on. It's one thing to book a show, and it's like winning the lottery again to have it picked up, and then again to have the show stay on the air.
I've had job stability for years at a time. You really develop great relationships with the people you work with.
I had an amazing experience with 'Third Watch'. I was so happy when 'The Game' came back because I never wanted it to end. And then with 'Burn Notice,' too.
I watch a lot of NBA basketball, especially with the playoffs.
