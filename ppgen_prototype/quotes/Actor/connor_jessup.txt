Canadian,Actor
I'm totally addicted to Japanese anime and spend way, way, way too much time watching it.
I don't really believe in the paranormal; I'm a skeptic through and through.
I love to write.
I'm big into social studies, the humanities. I really love history and world issues and philosophy and law.
I don't really know any survival skills of any kind.
I'm very unphysical and graceless so basically if you save 10 people to be with you in a resistance movement, you would never save me. I'd be the last one.
I can't really fight.
