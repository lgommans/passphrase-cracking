Whatever happens, happens. Accept things and move on.
We need to learn to observe and listen to people more to get to know them.
When my daughter was born, I said: 'I feel like I know what I've been waiting my whole life to be.'
I sometimes let people down, especially when I was younger. I was cavalier about what people told me. Part of growing up is learning when to shut up.
If I could eat without gaining weight or getting unhealthy, I would eat all the time.
