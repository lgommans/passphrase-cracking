American,Actor
I am very concerned about the environment and psychological health of this beautiful planet.
You can't get away from violence in drama. If you do not have conflict, you do not have drama.
If a brutal scene is shown for no reason except to shock, then it is bad.
Throughout my work is the idea, over and over, that we must all learn to respect one another.
