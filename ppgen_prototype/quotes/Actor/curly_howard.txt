American,Actor
I shoot an arrow into the air, where it lands I do not care: I get my arrows wholesale!
I had beautiful wavy hair and a waxed mustache.
Well being as there's no other place around the place, I reckon this must be the place, I reckon.
I got sick of the dough, and thought I'd go on the loaf.
Are you casting asparagus on my cooking?
