Australian,Actor
I wasn't a good kid in school. I wasn't a bad kid. I just didn't focus. My grades weren't good. I mucked around, you know, a phase everyone went through.
I was really fat in school.
I was a really big kid.
After Year 12, I went to Vancouver for my gap year and met an agent who told me to lose 25 kg.
Growing up, I was into 'Power Rangers.'
I was into Batman. I was into Spider-Man.
It sounds super cliche, but my sister is 12 years younger than me, and I remember when I was there holding her in my arms for the first time. And that kind of responsibility you feel when you hold a child in your arms.
I didn't have any friends. I was bullied. I didn't play sports.
I came from drama school, and it's a group of 18 people working together in every single production and splitting up the roles for three years, so I am very much about the team.
I am the biggest geek and fan of film and TV, and I just go through phases.
We'd be doing parkour on my high school roof; we'd get in trouble. But I was never a reckless kid.
My mum didn't really let me watch TV until I was about 5 years old.
My parents worked in the film industry, but they both worked behind the camera, so I like to think that I have a really good understanding of how all the parts of the puzzle come together to make a film or TV show.
It's not just the actor in front of the camera. And it's important to have respect for all those people that work behind the camera.
I have so much drive and passion for this industry and the creative arts, and I want other kids to have that kind of drive, and to have a fire in their belly for whatever industry that they want to get into.
