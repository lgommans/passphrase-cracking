The Prohibition era is so vividly depicted in 'Lawless.' John Hillcoat does a remarkable job of rooting his film in such a tangible reality.
I'm not the kind of person that seeks out other people's opinions on my works.
I'm not so sure I believe in dopplegangers. I just prefer to be Dane DeHaan.
Inevitably, I think the people that want to work with me are also the people that I want to work with.
I really just want to continue to challenge myself. And I want to continue to grow as an artist. I never want to stop.
When people recognize your work and want to reward you for what you've done, that's a good feeling.
I've always said that if I could do anything in the world, I would be a professional golfer.
I always wanted to be an actor, but my top three favorite actors of all time are Al Pacino, James Dean and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
I was a big 'Blue Valentine' fan. I really loved that movie. And I thought the performances were just unbelievably real, which is certainly what I always strive for in my work.
My parents have Google Alerts on me. So they'll often times send me an e-mail and be like, 'Hey did you know this?' And then I'll be like, 'Well, it is, like, my life. So yes, I did know that.' Or, 'That's not even true. I don't know where you read that.' I have Googled myself, yes. But my parents really have Google Alerts on me.
My parents were just really weird and protective about the music I listened to. Whenever I wanted to buy an album, they would have to buy it first and listen to it and let me know if I could have it.
It was weird - my parents would let me have some Green Day albums but not all Green Day albums.
There's a wealth of information on James Dean, and everybody has an opinion on him. James Dean made some kind of impression on everybody.
I started going to acting school in my senior year in high school, and I remained in acting school through four years of college.
