Canadian,Actor
When things could've gone really bad, rugby caught my interest and I really stuck with it. The sport brought me, maybe off the streets where we'd be fighting, into putting in a good effort in the rugby field where you're kind of rewarded for that rough behaviour instead of in trouble with the law.
I started drama in high school.
I like the fact that I can do stunts, but I don't think of myself as a stunt guy. Those guys are really good at what they do.
If you talk to any actor, they'll tell you that working is the best thing.
I don't mind what the role is at all; I just want to play cool characters.
Anything that involves the outdoors I'm all about, whether it be skiing, snowboarding, wakesurfing to mountain-biking. Anything that gets me outside.
If I can stay constantly busy, I'll be happy.
I would love to work on a Bond film.
If you look at all the vampires in the past, they were sort of decrepit old men. Stephanie Meyers just made it for a new audience. All the vampires are now young men and she describes them as not being ugly.
Think of how many mistakes you made at 22 years old. Like, I made a million.
I know what it's like to have an inflated libido.
I seem to be able to just sort of sink and slide under the radar, which is nice.
The more work I do and the more I put myself out there publicity-wise, it's gonna be less and less chances of me being able to just walk around without being noticed.
