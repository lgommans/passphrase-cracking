If you're filming a scene on horseback, if you're trying to control an animal that's much larger than you and trying to get it to do the exact same thing so you can match things up, that can get tricky, especially if the horse gets tired or angry or something.
I'm a point of conversation for my friends.
If someone is nice enough to come up to you and tell you how much they enjoy your work, and all they want in return is to take a photograph and for you to chat for five minutes, then I am delighted to do that.
