The funny thing is that I had never actually watched TV.
I hooked up everybody in Sidney, including one guy who was blind.
As Hollywood knows, I'm full of ideas.
My kids are fanatical about 'Scooby-Doo', and I think that the creators of 'Scooby-Doo' somehow tripped across some kind of magical hypnotic formula that lures children. It's far more fascinating to them than anything else on the air.
I think I'm long past the days where I would go to the store and drop a couple hundred bucks on CDs, so my playlist is gonna be pretty long in the tooth.
I'm not a big reggae dude. I have maybe two other reggae albums.
