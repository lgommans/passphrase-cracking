English,Actor
Let others hail the rising sun: I bow to that whose course is run.
Heaven sends us good meat, but the Devil sends cooks.
Corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves.
The boughs that bear most hang lowest.
Wonders will never cease.
You are indebted to you imagination for three-fourths of your importance.
