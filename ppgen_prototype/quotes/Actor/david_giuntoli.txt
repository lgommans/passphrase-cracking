Fame for fame's sake is never a good road to go down.
My mom told me to do whatever I wanted to do and don't get too anxious about it.
There's a lot of great stuff on TV.
I wouldn't say that I was ever a fan of MTV. I was a guy on MTV. I don't think I was ever in the demographic of people who watch MTV. I never really watched MTV, so I'm definitely not a fan of 'Jersey Shore' or anything.
Honestly, I grew up with Disney.
In episodic TV you have to keep things secret to keep the viewer in suspense.
The reluctant hero is always fun to play.
