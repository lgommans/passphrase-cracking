American,Actor
I'm a working actor so I never really pick a film because of a genre, and I don't really turn them down because of genre. Anything that's unlike the picture I just finished is always more interesting.
I'd worked with Mel Harris before, I love working with her, she's great.
I'm a father myself for the first time in my life, and I had very very loving parents.
I'd really love to play a real-life country and western singer.
I don't want to leave people thinking they've merely seen another actor using his same bag of tricks and fake charm.
I love just lying on the floor at home watching games with my dad. No pressures, just being me.
From sixth grade on I was a real Pillsbury doughboy. Overweight, long hair, thick glasses.
Fame means so little about somebody when you come right down to it.
