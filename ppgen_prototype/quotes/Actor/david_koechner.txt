American,Actor
I think I went into poli-sci because I knew there was a stage, plus I thought I wanted to help people, and I realized in poli-sci that if you want to be a politician you're either born into it, or you've got an amazing brain, which those are rare - and I don't have one.
I love bouncing between different genres. And comedy, obviously, is something I enjoy doing the most and I've had the most success with. But I'm open to all jobs and all genres.
I never sweat about work. I just assume work's coming.
I don't like people who don't have opinions.
Nothing trumps honesty, as far as I'm concerned.
