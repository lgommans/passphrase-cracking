The role of Charlie Eppes has changed me. I never imagined I would play a role like this. I lost some weight, grew my hair and now every woman in America over 40 wants to date me. It's their daughters I want to convince. The truth is all this talk makes me blush. Me, I look in the mirror and all I see is this Jewish kid from Queens.
Charlie's not your conventional mathematician... we sexed him up a little bit.
My parents went crazy when they found out that I had gotten the part in 'Conversations With My Father!' I'd never given acting a thought. They were proud of me and very encouraging.
So many shows out there dumb-down the country. It's so admirable to be part of a show that wants people to think.
It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population, and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.
What's great is that because math is such a universal language, really, our fans come in all shapes and sizes, all ages and genders and races and backgrounds and cultures.
Shooting this show is pretty intense. You lose your life. But I have no life, so it's perfect!
I lost some weight, grew my hair and now every woman in America over 40 wants to date me. It's their daughters I want to convince.
There is only so much I can understand and not screw up.
Me, I look in the mirror and all I see is this Jewish kid from Queens.
