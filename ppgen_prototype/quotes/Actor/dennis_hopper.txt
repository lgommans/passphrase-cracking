American,Actor
'Easy Rider' was never a motorcycle movie to me. A lot of it was about politically what was going on in the country.
Work is fun to me. All those years of being an actor and a director and not being able to get a job - two weeks is too long to not know what my next job will be.
Independent films in this country are in the same position. Miramax and Fine Line are not independent - they're with Disney! Come on. Or they're with Warner Brothers. They're all with somebody.
To make a documentary is one thing, to make a feature film is quite another.
