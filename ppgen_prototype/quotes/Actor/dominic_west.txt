British,Actor
The kiss always gets a hell of a reaction.
I think I've got a funny face.
Apparently it'll all settle down and they'll forget about it soon.
It would have been an interesting run if we hadn't gotten along! It was good casting, I suppose.
I don't know why British actors are getting big parts in American TV shows. Maybe it's because we're cheap.
I went to America to get away from constantly being cast in costume dramas, playing posh people.
For a straight man, I seem to have to kiss an awful lot of men!
I like to believe there are ghosts all over the place!
I'm only stopped by people in uniform, whether it's customs people, janitors, or the FBI - they all watch 'The Wire.' Sadly, beautiful, glamorous women don't know anything about it.
I've hung out at dozens of playgrounds, bored out of my mind, with not even a look of comfort from disapproving mothers all around me. Either they think I'm a pedophile or a deadbeat dad. That's what I get for being a single dad - suspicious looks at the playground.
I've always wanted to play more comic parts.
You've got to grab every opportunity that comes up.
If you do an American TV series, before the audition you sign away the next five years of your life.
No, I don't think 'The Wire' screwed up my career at all.
People seem to think I'm Satan.
My mum's parents were from Ireland, my dad's mum was American-Irish.
I look ridiculous in a three-piece suit - I'm too fat.
Prince Charles is the best-dressed man in the world.
I'm a rather crude cook.
Since I got married my wife doesn't really let me wear anything that I used to because she says I have no taste at all.
