What is wrong in getting divorced? If a couple is incompatible and just cannot stay married anymore, should they put on a show of togetherness just for the sake of society, or, for that matter, any extended family?
My biggest grouse since the time I filed for divorce has been that when all the drama unfolded, the children were made pawns. That should never be the case. You never know how it affects them.
I am an actor who turned hero at age 32, after many years of struggle. I wanted to break the stereotype that only good-looking men with a good complexion, height and physique can be heroes, which I have managed to do.
The aim is to move from doing just action dramas to establishing myself as someone who can do family dramas as well.
