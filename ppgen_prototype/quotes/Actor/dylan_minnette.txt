One time, this guy at this music festival would not let me off the hook that I was Percy Jackson. He was like, 'Quit lying to me, bro, I know you're Percy Jackson.' I was like, 'I swear to God, I'm not Percy Jackson.'
Everyone's like, 'Oh my God, can I ask you something? You were in 'Percy Jackson,' right?' I'm like, 'No, different guy.'
'Halloween' is classic Michael Myers.
I was always a really big fan of R. L. Stine and the 'Goosebumps' T.V. series and the 'Goosebumps' books.
I knew about 'Haunting Hour' and that it was basically the new 'Goosebumps'. When I got offered the role of Corey, I was really excited because I basically felt like I was going to be in a new generation of 'Goosebumps'. It was a lot of fun, because I just love those scary shows, and I'm such a big fan of the horror genre.
I love being in anything that's scary to people.
I have this ability to really leave set and just cut off from it immediately.
I pass on a lot of teen roles that get sent to me because a lot of the time it doesn't feel real. It's sugar-coated. There's no depth to it.
'Goosebumps,' actually, was a very big part of my childhood, growing up, and it inspired me to get into horror and all that good stuff.
It's really surreal to be in something under the 'Goosebumps' title.
'It Follows' is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
My dad has been playing guitar basically all his life. He's sort of who got me into rock music.
