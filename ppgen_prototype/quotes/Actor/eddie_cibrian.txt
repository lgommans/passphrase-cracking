American,Actor
You cannot imagine how great it is to step out on the stage with thousands of screaming fans loving you.
I crave attention and adventure.
I think there are some people who are just kind of born to create drama and then capitalise on it.
I love my boys very much. I want only the best for them and am committed to being a devoted father.
