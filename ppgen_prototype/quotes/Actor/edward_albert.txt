Sometimes you have to be selfish to be selfless.
The simple act of caring is heroic.
In times of life crisis, whether wild fires or smoldering stress, the first thing I do is go back to basics... am I eating right, am I getting enough sleep, am I getting some physical and mental exercise everyday.
Fear is the only true enemy, born of ignorance and the parent of anger and hate.
Some days it is a heroic act just to refuse the paralysis of fear and straighten up and step into another day.
I always knew I would act. It was just a matter of time.
Let us begin by doing our best to do our best, every single time, no matter what, forever.
In 1969, at the age of 19, I was lucky enough to work with George C. Scott in the definitive portrayal of his career over a period of many months and several countries on the definitive film version of Patton's WWII career.
Courage is just fear, plus prayers, plus understanding.
On a level of simple personal survival, understanding and forgiveness are crucial... whether in an intimate personal relationship or on a global level.
What I want to be is an actor, not a star.
