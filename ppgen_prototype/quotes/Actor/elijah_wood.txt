I think being different, going against the grain of society is the greatest thing in the world.
There's a real purity in New Zealand that doesn't exist in the states. It's actually not an easy thing to find in our world anymore. It's a unique place because it is so far away from the rest of the world. There is a sense of isolation and also being protected.
In the absence of love, there is nothing worth fighting for.
I definitely don't look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me.
So much time is wasted on trying to be better than others.
Dream the impossible because dreams do come true.
I had a woman breakdown and cry when she met me which was difficult to deal with because immediately when someone starts to cry, you want to comfort them, you know, 'Poor thing.' I comforted her. I tried to make her feel better.
The worst kind of lying I've ever done is keeping things from people.
I'm kind of insane when it comes to music, a little obsessed.
If you cut off your arm instead of going 'spurt, spurt, spurt' wouldn't it, like, go nuts? Or would it go with the beat of your heart?
