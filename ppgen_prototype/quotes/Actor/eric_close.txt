American,Actor
The majority of the world - including myself - we all have problems and difficulty in life, and life's messy. But there are great rewards in life, too.
I told my parents, 'You've taken care of me all my life, helped me through college. You've been awesome, but now it's my turn to be my own man.'
I have friends that tease me about 'Without a Trace;' they say, 'You're really good at saying, 'Have you seen this person?'
I was a wild kid in high school. I liked to get crazy and be rebellious and go to parties and do all that kind of stuff.
I just feel that God gave me a certain gift, and that was to go out, do storytelling and be an actor. And my responsibility with that gift is to do the best job possible and to re-create real life.
I'm always trying to look for different roles.
A lot of factors go into the longevity of a show.
The two most important words in marriage for me are 'yes, dear.'
It's amazing to me how people throw stuff on the ground right next to a trash can. That drives me crazy.
I love country music.
I've always been a big fan of Nashville, and I have friends that live there.
I pick up other people's trash. I'm sort of obsessed.
It is beautiful in Vancouver; let's face it. I mean, you have the ocean. There's mountains.
The Monte Carlo TV Festival is great because it's a celebration of television and great storytelling.
If you looked at my iPod, you would get a trip out of all the different music, from the real heavy metal to bluegrass to classical.
John Denver I listened to when I was in elementary school.
I think love is blind. I hate to use that cliched statement, but people, when they love somebody, they seem to be able to somehow to put aside red flags.
