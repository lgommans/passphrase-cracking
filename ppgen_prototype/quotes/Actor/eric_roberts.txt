My wife and I have so much fun when we travel and find anything... like stray cats and squirrels.
Yeah, some of my college friends and I have been tinkering around for years, you know, just for fun.
I think maybe Mr. Sinise and Mr. Bacon have slightly bigger egos than I do.
We loved being in Russia and would love to go back again, especially to visit my namesake.
I did have a dog for a few years when I was little, but then just really had cats until I was about 21.
And then I bought my own horse, which I had until it died.
Years later I made a movie with Wayne Newton, who has Arabians.
We consider all our animals to be our kids.
I'm a real bore.
I ride my horses three to four times a week.
And I'm as attached to my wife as anybody can be to another human being.
The earth is a great big orphanage for most animals.
But if you love animals for all the right reasons- and that's just love and affection- then you're going to go after animals who need you.
But I can't remember who is in my CD player now.
My first four roles were all nice guys, Raggedy Man being one of them.
I have a movie coming out called Spun, which will be at the Toronto Film Fest.
But the thing about bad guys is that they have the biggest bosomed blond, they have great clothes and cars, and get great death scenes.
Sometimes movie-making happens like clockwork; other times, like a car accident.
I'm really good with fighting with my feet.
Sylvester Stallone is very funny and he's a great guy to hang out with.
Well, I quit smoking three weeks ago and I had a hard day today not smoking.
As I've gotten older I look like a man, finally.
The point of my explanation is I'm very subjective when it comes to describing my characters: they are all a little bit a part of me from the outside in or the inside out - but to put your mind at ease, I built Paul Snider from the outside in.
