I learned not to blink in a close-up or move your head at all, because if you did, they wouldn't use it.
I'll be 65 in September and I work as much as I want to, take cruises with Kay, relax with my family, do everything in moderation, because I want to enjoy my life.
Well, we all age, but I'd been taking herbal supplements for a long time.
When I started to play trumpet I was fortunate to learn very quickly.
Rocco paid me 35 bucks a week at Murray's Inn in South Jersey. People started asking Rocco to have me sing.
No sooner than I did take it seriously, I had million-selling hits and movies with John Wayne.
Kids know me from their Grease DVD, so they instantly respond. You can hear a pin drop when I do my old songs.
I was not a trained actor.
I've been around two years shy of 50 years doing what I do. I am a musician.
They weren't great pictures, but they were fun, and they really represented that period of time well.
I think today's music absolutely stinks. I really do mean that.
These kids today, everything is about hitting a vocal home run.
They look for the top note to end every song. They don't know what they are singing about. There is no style.
Yes, but I don't think of the Teen Angel as of an age.
I like that because the fans want to see onstage what they know so well from the big screen.
I wish I could talk to Annette, but she doesn't even correspond at this point.
It captures a lot of the spirit of the '50s.
The kids have all seen it on DVD or videotape.
