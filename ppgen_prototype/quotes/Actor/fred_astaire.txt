The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.
The higher up you go, the more mistakes you are allowed. Right at the top, if you make enough of them, it's considered to be your style.
This search for what you want is like tracking something that doesn't want to be tracked. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable.
I just put my feet in the air and move them around.
I have no desire to prove anything by dancing. I have never used it as an outlet or a means of expressing myself. I just dance. I just put my feet in the air and move them around.
Dancing is a sweat job.
I don't want to be the oldest performer in captivity... I don't want to look like a little old man dancing out there.
Disco is just jitterbug.
