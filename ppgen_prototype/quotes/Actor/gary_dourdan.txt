I've never liked categories; I've never liked boxes; I've always tried to be unconventional as much as I possibly could.
I have to protect myself because people think that because you come into 25 million homes every week, they know you. I walk the line between being gracious and being rude.
When I did 'Alien: Resurrection', a lot of the guys worked on planned production, and one of them was really into comic books and would draw all sorts of characters, and I was impressed with his sketches.
