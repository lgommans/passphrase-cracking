The reasons asthma doesn't affect my work or play is that I had accurate diagnostics and follow treatment regimens closely. It's when someone thinks they're fine and that they don't need help that they usually get in trouble.
The key in controlling my asthma is pretty simple: I have a good professional diagnosis, and I follow my doctor's instructions closely. You need to acknowledge both.
My dad passed on asthma to me. It's kind of ironic because he outgrew it at 13.
Asthma doesn't affect me, even though I have it. It can seem like it wants to act up a little if I'm nervous before going on stage, but that's natural to many performers. If I think it's going to be a problem, I just reach for my inhaler.
