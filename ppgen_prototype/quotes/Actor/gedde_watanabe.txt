American,Actor
Yeah, I went to ACT for a while. It was great.
There's something in the moment when you can make them laugh or cry and show and incredibly compassionate side of life. I find that a really exemplary way to live.
Look at television and how comparatively few minorities are out there.
It's the most extraordinary and saddest thing, the amount of talent out there not being seen.
I've got a big mole on my butt. It's true.
I've been just like any other working actor, out there looking for stuff.
I'm going bald. I'm having a major problem with it.
I want to direct. It's something that I know I'll be really good at.
I used to be a street singer in San Francisco.
I still feel like there are a lot of things in me that people haven't seen. My soul hasn't been bared yet.
I did a film a long time ago with a shaved head and I had the ugliest looking head in the world.
Back in the 60s, San Francisco artists lived in communes.
