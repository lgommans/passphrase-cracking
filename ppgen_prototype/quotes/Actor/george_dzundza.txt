I love Philadelphia. I was shocked at what a great city this is. For me, it is the cat's pajamas. I love everything about it. I love where I live. I love the people. I have been met with such kindness and affection here.
Throughout the course of my life, I've been blessed to work with extremely talented people.
The writers are writing human beings, and they're writing about the human condition and how difficult it is to function in that condition. I think it's one of the charms of the show, the idea of redemption and working towards becoming better people, for everybody involved.
My concern has always been that people who I portray, or the professions that I portray, are not embarrassed by my portrayal of them.
If you know you're going to be outside, you have to be a little bit more in tune, so that you don't get distracted by what's going on and focus better.
I just am grateful for every opportunity to go to work. I don't really focus on celebrity status.
I feel like a nuclear missile. Point me in that direction, I'll go.
