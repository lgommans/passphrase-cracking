American,Actor
There's always the new wrinkle. One must keep one's eyes always open.
From my point of view, there is a lot of joy in stage work.
I love to entertain an audience.
If they'll have me and the show does well, I could do this another two or three years.
It's not that I'm knocking the movie and television work.
You have problems, you think drink helps, then you have two problems.
The temporal quality of all things was being firmly impressed upon me.
Some people do better on their own. I don't.
