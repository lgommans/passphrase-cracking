Technology is at the forefront of everything these days - communication, work. It's amazing and scary at the same time how robots have evolved, but I find it hard to believe that robots will completely rule the world. Not in my lifetime anyway.
Just the idea to have everything you need essentially stored in one piece of portable technology is very exciting.
I have done hard jobs in the past, and acting isn't one of them.
I came home for a week after I finished filming 'Rambo' because, after being in the jungle for three months, all I wanted to do was walk in the Highlands.
I am the complete and utter definition of a Luddite.
