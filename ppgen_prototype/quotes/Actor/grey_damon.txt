American,Actor
I've actually been asked once or twice if I had some Puerto Rican in me.
I don't really enjoy watching reality TV.
I think that there's not much point to being an actor if you're not enjoying it, so I try to be picky about roles I do like to go out for.
My ma and pa are both very artistic, so I suppose it's in my blood. But my ma's the one who was into theater and such. I owe my love of it to her. If she didn't drag me to small community workshops when I was a wee little lad or exposed me to anything artistic for that matter, I wouldn't be who I am today.
I think about the work I've landed, and I think to myself, 'If I never land a job again, I could still die happy.'
