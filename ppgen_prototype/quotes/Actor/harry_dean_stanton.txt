I just want to say, good night, sweet prince, may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
I play myself all the time, on camera and off. What else can I do?
I don't believe in singing lessons. You can sing or you can't.
Heisenberg, Max Plank and Einstein, they all agreed that science could not solve the mystery of the universe.
I sing and play guitar and harmonica. I've been doing it for a long time.
But I'm not imaginative. I couldn't look into the future, like Star Wars or Robots or anything like that.
You want people walking away from the conversation with some kernel of wisdom or some kind of impact.
You want people to feel something when you tell a story, whether they feel happy or whether they feel sad.
I know little stories that happen to people around me, and I can repeat that in a way that has some color.
I like to stay home and watch television. The Game Show channel, mostly.
I'm not really into religion.
I've received a lot of compliments. People come right up to me on the street. They recognize me.
Speech lessons probably did more for my singing voice - they teach you breathing, resonance.
I have a good ear for languages.
The band I've played with for 10 or 12 years now, we've been all over, but we mostly play in LA.
I really liked the Mariachi singing in Westerns.
California is full of Mexican culture and Mexican music.
I took speech training. I took a few voice lessons in college.
I've never been ambitious about recording.
