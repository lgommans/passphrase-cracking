American,Actor
I love to cook like a mad man. If I could do it all over again? I would be a NBA basketball player.
Apparently, I am a bit of an exaggerator when I tell stories. But I don't call them lies; I say they are better, funnier truths.
Garfield is my spirit animal.
It's so fun to hear the reaction from Martin Scorsese as he sees you nude for the first time.
There are a lot of good actors who work forever and never make one good thing.
Who is the pinnacle of male-ness in America? Leonardo DiCaprio.
I love reading for a character I have no business reading for.
