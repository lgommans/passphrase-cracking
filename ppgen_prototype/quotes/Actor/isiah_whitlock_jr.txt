American,Actor
I'm a winemaker and a wine collector, so I usually just drink wine.
I always figure, you come to a party, you gotta know somebody. And somebody leads to another person and leads to somebody else, somebody else. That's one of things that I really enjoy doing.
Usually, when you're working or you're on set, everything is very guarded. At parties, people have a tendency to relax.
I don't stay out that late. I never really stay out that late. I used to, and after a while you begin to realize that a little sleep works wonders, you know?
When I went to San Francisco for the first time in 1975, I went there for a summer, this acting training program for three months in the summer - I've never been the same.
