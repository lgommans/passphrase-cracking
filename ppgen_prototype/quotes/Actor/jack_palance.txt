One of the most important reasons for living is to do something - live outside of yourself and put together an idea, an idea that you want to explore and then complete... Awaken your creative sensitivities!
The only two things you can truly depend upon are gravity and greed.
I used to be six foot four. Now that I'm old, I slouch. So, I'm six foot three.
I go to see maybe seven films a year at the most, and since I only go to see the best, it follows that I very rarely see my own.
