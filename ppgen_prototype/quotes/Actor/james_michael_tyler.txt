American,Actor
Acting-wise, I did a web series. I play a music agent in a series called 'Keeping Up with the Downs.'
I honestly always thought my Master's in Fine Arts would get me further in the acting world than knowing how to work an espresso machine!
I live in the area where the Hollywood sign is. Every afternoon, I'll take a daily walk, and there are loads of tourists always on the street taking photos of the Hollywood sign. Occasionally, I'll still get recognized as 'Gunther,' which is okay with me.
I never have been a big coffee drinker.
I have a friend who wanted to practise on my head because they wanted to be a stylist. So I offered what hair I had left to turn white.
