English,Actor
I like the 'Cirque du Freak' books - 'Tunnel of Blood' by Darren Shan. They're set in England. It's about vampires.
I can't really go without being noticed. I'll keep my head a bit lower than usual. I've got to keep my head out of trouble, because if it goes on, it would be 'Harry Potter boy this, Harry Potter boy that.'
I like producing beats, and I like rapping, too. I have a program for the PC, and I can hook my keyboard to it.
I like - not so much jewelry and that - but jackets, clothes, games as well.
I used to like doing school plays.
