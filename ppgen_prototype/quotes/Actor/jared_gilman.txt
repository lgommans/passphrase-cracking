American,Actor
I don't think I'd ever really survive the outdoors.
I'm a huge movie buff, so I'm a fan of a lot of actors and actresses.
I was always a very indoor videogame nerd movie buff... Now I've come to appreciate Scouts and the outdoors.
Before 'Moonrise,' I never thought I would be in a movie where I would be struck by lightning.
You're not allowed to mess up in theater, and if you do, it is going to be embarrassing. But in film, if you make a mistake you just do it over again. You can just do another take.
I am really indoors-y. I am a video game and movie buff, and this keeps me in my little boy cave.
I got a manager, and I thought, since I was going out on auditions, I should do this for a living. Then there was this moment on set when I realized I was having a lot of fun, and I really wanted to do this forever. I want to do different stuff, but I want it all to be just as good as this film. I want to be consistent.
