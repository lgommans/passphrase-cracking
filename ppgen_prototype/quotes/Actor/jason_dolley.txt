Being home schooled is awesome because you can make your own schedule, so as far as time management, it's up to you how much you get done and when you get it done. It's all got to get done; how you do it is up to you.

With hacky sack, somebody brought one to recess in sixth grade and it kind of all went downhill from there! The same with the yoyo's! One kid brought a yoyo one day and people started getting them. I just kept at it and found that I really loved it.
If I'm on a show, then that's my favorite channel.
When I was on 'Complete Savages,' the cast sometimes found themselves running from a mob of girls. There is nothing quite like that.
For whatever reason, I enjoy eating soggy cereal.
I have one chocolate Lab named Jasmine. I also had a rat named Sky.
I went to a pretty small school from the beginning all the way up, so I knew everyone, everyone knew me.
Honestly, I would think I would go way back to Biblical times and be one of the guys who saw Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. It would be so cool to see what he was really like in person.
I grew up in Southern California, Simi Valley. I've lived in the same house all my life.
My first job was an AFI short film, 'Chasing Daylight,' when I was 11, and I made a couple of commercials that never aired.
One of my favorite comedies is 'Three Amigos!' Oh my gosh, me and my brother quote that all the time.
I think faith helps me a lot. God wants you to be where He wants you to be, and that's where I want to be. If I do not get a part, I understand that maybe I needed to be home at that time, maybe in school; there's always a reason. My faith is also where my core friends are, at my church, a faith-based friendship.
