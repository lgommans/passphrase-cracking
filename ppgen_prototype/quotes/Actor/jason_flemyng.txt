English,Actor
I've got the body of a model and the face of a coal miner.
I run four times a week.
I'm into the whole skincare thing.
I live in jeans, mainly Wrangler and Nudie. I like them as dark blue as they'll go and tightly woven.
A film is like a mad arranged marriage, with all these people who don't necessarily want to be with each other forced into this intimate, exhausting process.
Running has been great for keeping me fit throughout my acting career.
