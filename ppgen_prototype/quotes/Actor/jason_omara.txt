Irish,Actor
I've spent three hours hanging upside down while fighting off dinosaur attacks. That was a lot of fun.
I became an American citizen three years ago, and if I'd been arrested, maybe that wouldn't have happened. That was a very proud moment, by the way. I still have my Irish passport, but becoming an American citizen was important in terms of my family.
I called my family, saying, 'Guess what? I got a new show. It's about a cop who travels in time.' And they said, 'I think we've seen that one.'
Sometimes the things that scare me are the things I'm drawn to: moving to London, L.A., New York; marrying, having a kid. In order to live a full life, sometimes you have to do things that scare you.
That's the challenging thing with TV; it's not the action scenes per se, and it's not the location scenes and the heavy dialog scenes, but the fact that there is just no let-up; there is no break.
I like to play very raw characters, characters who have a degree of vulnerability and passion about what they're doing.
People tell you not to work with children and animals, and I chose to work with a 7-year-old and several dinosaurs!
I turned up my nose at yoga for years. I was a rugby player growing up. But now I know. When I'm on those long international flights, like 22 hours from L.A. to Sydney, I'll get up sometimes and do yoga in the aisle just to stretch out a little bit.
I just watched the entire season of 'Louie' in one flight. What an amazing show.
When I was on 'Terra Nova', I had an Australian iPhone and a U.S. iPhone, different time zones, just a couple differences in the machines, but I was able to keep the international aspect of things in order. But I lost my U.S. iPhone right before I left Australia. Somebody's got it somewhere out there. Send it back?
A sense of humor saves your life, and being able to make friends wherever you go.
