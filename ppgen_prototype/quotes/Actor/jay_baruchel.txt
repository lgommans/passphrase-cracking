Canadian,Actor
No one has a resume that they are 100% comfortable with, nor does anyone have a life that they are 100% comfortable with.
I have a maple leaf tattoo over my heart, quite literally, and my two favorite things on Earth are being in Canada and making movies.
I think sports makes for good drama because it has all the same ingredients as anything worth reading or listening to or watching. Conflict, desire, heartbreak - it's all there.
The hockey I was raised on, the hockey I understand, the hockey that my dad taught me about when I was a boy was intrinsically connected with fighting. I grew up in a house where we revered tough guys.
I am a proud Montrealer. Jobs will take me where they take me, but nothing will ever be able to convince me to leave my home.
If it were up to me, every job would be somewhere in Canada.
I'm a massive movie nerd. That being said, I could retire tomorrow because I wrote this movie 'Goon' and it came out, and it connected and it's a wonderful flick that I think is beautiful and then it had this wonderful life and it means a lot to a lot of people.
I enjoy acting, and it's given me a ton of happiness and it's affected my life and my family's lives in ways that we just can't imagine.
Montreal is a great town. There's equal parts blue-collar town.
Long before I ever started acting, believe it or not, I always knew I wanted to be a director.
There's a chunk of myself in every part I play.
You grow up skinny in Canada; in working-class Montreal, you're definitely the underdog.
For every big American movie I've done where I was the supporting guy, I've gone back home to Canada to do supporting movies where I was the lead.
I like writing strong women, because as a straight male, there's nothing more attractive to me than a strong girl.
