You don't really see too many straight friendships between men and women on 'Mad Men.'
I don't know what 'Mad Men' has done for my fan base. I didn't know that I still had a fan base, to be honest.
Certainly I'm always willing to talk to anyone who's interested in talking to me!
I have been recognized from 'Mad Men,' and it's so cool when that happens because I am so proud to be a part of the show.
I would be absolutely honored if I made Jon Hamm crack, because he is uncrackable.
Let me just tell you this: I love polyester.
I'm from Dallas. My whole family is based in Texas and Mississippi and Arkansas, spread throughout most of the South.
My first gig was 'The Outsiders.' I was 14 there. And probably one of the more jading experiences in my whole life.
