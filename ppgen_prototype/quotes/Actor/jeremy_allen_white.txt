I mean, 'Girls': I love 'Girls,' I watch 'Girls.' But it's a show that's very coastal. People in New York and people in L.A. and people in San Francisco will watch it. But I think in Middle America, for the most part, it probably isn't watched as much.
I think 'Shameless' is more of an everyman's show, whereas as great as I think 'Girls' is, it's got a smaller audience.
I'd love to do something on 'Mad Men' and 'Boardwalk Empire.' I really like period stuff.
A director will always tell you, when you go in to do a scene, 'You go as big as you want, and I'll tell you when to come down.' And I found that on 'Shameless,' you can't follow that rule because they will never tell you to come down. So, I've had to find my own balance with when it makes sense to get this upset or angry.
