My father loved me so much that he did not want me to be a laborer or anything. I don't know if it's the right thing to do - push your kids into something and then stay on them until they do it. Let them pick what they want to do.
I'm just some lunatic macaroni mushroom, is that it?
I love to star in movies, but I want to have good roles. It doesn't help to get starring roles in something that's no good. I mean, that will just kill you.
I dyed my hair blonde in that movie, so my head doesn't match my grill.
Did Mad freakin' Max just call me irritating?
You don't say hello to Mr. DeNiro? Show the respect, will ya?
Ah, I don't do interviews, really.
I've been married three times, but I'll never forget my first trip as a young man, on my honeymoon, with my new wife.
Scorsese and De Niro taught me to bring out the natural side of myself. And they taught me to think of myself as the average guy. Sometimes the average guy belongs in a role more than your matinee idol-type of person. We have to have people we can relate to.
