Actually, before 'Super 8,' I didn't even have a game console. But now I do. For a kickoff for 'Super 8,' they gave us all brand new PlayStation 3s.
In my family, if I talk back to my dad, I get in trouble.
I like to think I'm a very mature person.
I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I just can't draw.
I'm not a huge Steven Spielberg nerd, but I know about him and I know of his work.
I really do want to act, I love acting, and I want to do it in the long run.
In my house, I'm not allowed to shout at anybody. It's very strict. It's a very Christian home.
