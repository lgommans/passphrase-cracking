The possibilities in sci-fi are wonderful. The subject is bigger than everything we know.
I'd love to fly, especially with the gas prices right now.
Bad guys are so much fun to play because you can go as far and as wacky as you want.
To play a good guy is nice because in a way, he is so open for answers.
I remember watching Jodie Foster in Contact, and that kind of opened my eyes.
I know every actor says this, but the people behind the camera are great. They always have answers.
I was really interested in meeting Peter Coyote.
I was right for the role. It's as simple as that.
It was always me and the other guy. I came in second for a long time.
In some strange way, this was meant to be.
