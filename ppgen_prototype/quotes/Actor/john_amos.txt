It was an ongoing struggle to say no, I don't want to be a part of the perpetuation of this stereotype.
They killed my character off and as God would have it, just when they told me I would never work again, I got cast in a little program called Roots, and as they would say, the rest is history.
I could have begged. They made it obvious to me that if I wanted to come back and be a good boy... but I'd rather be in Roots than Good Times.
I've never seen oil slicks covering such a large area in the Gulf of Mexico.
