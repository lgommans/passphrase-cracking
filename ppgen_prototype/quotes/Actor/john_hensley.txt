American,Actor
I actually find Los Angeles, in the daily sense, a quite normal place to live. It is certainly contingent upon how normal the person living there might be. I don't think you have to look far in any city to see people looking for the right answer in the wrong place.
Do I have my insecurities? Hell yes, just like anybody else. I can obsess over the most ridiculous things, just like anybody else.
I've got my bag of goodies; I've got flaws coming out of every pore, but that's part of who I am. A bit of the process of life is learning to live with those things and accept yourself regardless. Maybe try to become a better person, either because of - or in spite of - those things.
The image that comes to mind when I think of 'Nip/Tuck,' is I literally picture a nail just getting driven through wood. You know what I mean? Just getting absolutely bashed through a two by four.
I'm happy to fight for any role.
I can get behind any story that's willing to tell itself without apology.
As an actor, I think it is important you at least almost like the character that you're playing. Or can find a personal justification for the character as to why they're doing what they're doing.
