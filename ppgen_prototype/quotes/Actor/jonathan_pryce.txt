Welsh,Actor
I'm not a star, I'm an actor - there's a difference!
I grew up in the 1950s at the beginning of rock n' roll, and would strum a tennis racket in front of the mirror.
I live a very ordinary life. The rare awards ceremonies I go to are quite fun, because I can enjoy the irony of one minute walking to the tube, and the next being driven along the same stretch of road in a limo.
I have just enough public appreciation to make me happy.
I know people whose entire lives are ruined by fame. If you make yourself exclusive, people want to break that down, but if you go about doing your shopping, no one bugs you.
When I left school, I wanted to be an artist, specifically a painter.
The older you get, the more you find yourself looking for things you used to see and liked when you were younger.
Oddly enough, I'm not religious but I'm also very fond of St Peter's in Rome. When I'm there, I always know there's a good meal not far away.
I'll read a book every now and then, but unlike most of my friends I don't always have one on the go.
