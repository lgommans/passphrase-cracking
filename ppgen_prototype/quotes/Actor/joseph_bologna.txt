So to me, Texas Hold 'em puts me to sleep. At least when you play stud, you can be funny as you deal. Somebody some day is going to come up with a Stud show that's going to work.
You know, people come up with formulas who are uncreative. They can't picture something different so they can only go by something that's laid out for them.
When I was a kid, there was no distinction between a movie about old people or young people. It was either funny or not. It was either entertaining or not. It was either exciting or not. It was either thrilling or not.
Why can't she move in with you? Is she against that? She's not a Mormon or anything, is she?
The stage is suspension of disbelief. Film is a literal medium.
My favorite comedians were Jimmy Durante, George Burns, senior citizens.
My favorite actors when I was a kid were in their '60s. Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne.
Most people would rather stay home and watch Casablanca for the fourth time or the 10th time on Turner Classic Movies than go see Matrix 12 or whatever the hell the flavor of the month is.
I think grown-ups don't go to movies because they're much more discerning.
I keep working mainly because my wife and I spend most of our time touring the country doing our own plays.
I get up in the morning, do my e-mail, I check my e-mails all day. I'll go online and I'll buy my books at Amazon.com, but I don't want to buy all of them because I want to go to Duttons and I want to buy books from another human being.
But, having said that, believe me, as you get older, the parts dry up. They get less and less.
