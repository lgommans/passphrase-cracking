American,Actor
I don't have a grand master plan, but I try to be thoughtful when I can and also silly. It's part of the fun.
My dad said to me growing up: 'When all is said and done, if you can count all your true friends on one hand, you're a lucky man.'
I am a lefty, though I bat right-handed... When I was a kid I pitched, played first, outfield and shortstop as well. Now it's mainly softball with some friends.
There's certain things that you can do on cable that you can't do here on network TV, so then you have to think outside the box a little bit.
I never considered a career in broadcasting, not even as a kid.
I grew up in Baltimore. And yes, I am a big sports fan, especially when it comes to my local teams.
One of the perks of being an actor is to get to meet athletes that you respect. Especially who played before my time. Brooks Robinson is one of those athletes; they just don't make them any nicer.
I'm an everything Baltimore fan.
I'm kind of new to Twitter. I'm about one year in, so I'm a little late to the party.
Any time you get to dig deeper into your character, you welcome it, especially on a TV show.
It's fun to play a character who lives on the edge, who is an ethical and moral mess, and is paying the price for some of his actions.
My job is to play many different roles with all sorts of different backgrounds and orientations.
One thing I've learned about his business is this whole 'plan thing' - it doesn't work.
What I want out of my career is just to work.
There's a touch of the gambler in anybody really competitive and somebody that's willing to concede that to succeed, sometimes you need to cut corners and to make bold choices.
