I'd been a fanatic of movies since I was a wee lad, so I got into the films before I got into the comics.
'X-Men' films have always been big, and necessarily so, because of the stories they have to tell.
I actually had the good fortune to work with Nick Hoult on 'Mad Max' in Africa, so we became really fast friends.
The great thing about 'X-Men' is that it takes characters that are quite firmly established in the comics and puts them in new contexts.
I started on the original comics from Stan Lee and all the artists and storytellers did from there, and I got to the graphic novel that Chris Clairmont did, which is the one Stryker comes from - 'God Loves, Man Kills', which is a brilliant story.
