Australian,Actor
I've been a fan of Showtime for a long, long time, and I've been a fan of the shows that it's had on.
In this industry, you're so used to heartbreak because nine out of 10 times, you don't get what you want. But, that one out of 10 times, you do and it's just the best feeling in the world.
You can never predict what an audience is going to respond to and what they're going to watch.
You are only as good as the people you work with, I think.
I love working in Australia. I'm happiest when I get to do it.
I will always come back to do Australian films. I think it matters. I think we can make films that people go and see. And I don't think it's too much to ask that films in this country make a profit and that we embrace them.
