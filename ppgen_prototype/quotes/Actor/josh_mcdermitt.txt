'The Walking Dead' was my favorite show before I even auditioned for it. That's every actor's dream, to be on a show that they're a fan of. It's just dark, and as a comedian, I'm drawn to dark things.
One person I haven't worked with yet, who I find hilarious, is Chad Coleman.
The really cool thing about when you're playing a comic book character is that no one knows what he sounds like.
I can't imagine being on one of those shows where people have to look nice.
We went a few decades without a good mullet on TV, so I'm happy to bring it back.
Thankfully, I don't have a real mullet.
A lot of times, working in stand up, you're by yourself, and so you just have to rely on yourself only... but I like working in an ensemble.
That's the easiest job you can have in TV comedy, being the guy who just delivers the funny.
