One of my true dreams is to do a sports talk radio show and take calls.
I firmly believe that knowing too much too soon can color your performance in a not good way. I just don't want to know until I need to know.

Every time I get an autograph, I feel like I'm taking home a little piece of that star. What drives me is the intrinsic value.
The Sooners are my religion. I've been back to watch the games several times. I'm into all their sports. I'm a tremendous fan.
I never wanted to be a star, and I don't really want to be famous. I just love the stability of my life. I'm a complete family guy.
