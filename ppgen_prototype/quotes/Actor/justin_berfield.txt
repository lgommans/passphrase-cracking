The wheels are spinning in my head all the time.
L.A. can be intense, but the second you get over the hill into Calabasas, your stress level immediately drops because it's so peaceful and safe. Sometimes I really miss it.
Being in front of the camera, you never got to see the whole process from the conception of the script all the way through to the filming process.
