It's all about story and character with me, and I don't care if the job is on daytime or prime time or the web. Hey, give me a good character and someone to listen, and I'll do my acting on a street corner.
I don't have a gardener, because I enjoy pulling weeds. It's hard to explain, but there is something fulfilling about pulling out a weed and knowing that you got all the roots.
One of the things I wanted to do was direct. There've been a couple of times that a director will walk up and say something to me, and all it does is make me mad. Inside I'll go, 'Well, that wasn't helpful at all.'
Any father can relate to feeling like a superhero when you put a Band-Aid on your kid.
I found a very comfortable style in that if I know everyone's job around me, it's going to make me better at my job.
If you sit and feel sorry for yourself, you're wasting your time. You should be in acting class, instead of feeling sorry for yourself. You should be working.
I know, who doesn't want to play a superhero, right? And everyone wants to play Superman or Batman. Everyone wants to play a superhero.
I'm so pumped about joining 'Y&R' - I watch it all the time and can't wait to get in there and get my hands dirty!
I have great respect for daytime drama. I love the branding. I love the style. What can I say? I love good soap!
