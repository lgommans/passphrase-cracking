American,Actor
I've grown this mustache which saves me from having to glue on one every day in the heat.
I like the Western genre, I think it's uniquely American.
When you get all this stuff on and you put on the guns and the hair, it has an effect on the actor. It tends to lend a certain something to the way you feel as you're just walking around looking that way.
The Western genre is certainly something with which I'm familiar.
He was definitely known as the foremost man killer in the West; however there's controversy about virtually every killing that he was known to have been involved in.
But I love to be outdoors. I prefer being outdoors to, you know, being inside.
And so I love films that are kind of rural in atmosphere. And you know, it's just a nice place to be day after day. All be it, it can be hard, it can be hard work. You can get hot.
