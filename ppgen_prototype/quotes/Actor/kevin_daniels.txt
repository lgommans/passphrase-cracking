American,Actor
I've always wanted to be one of those actors who could change from character to character, like Daniel Day Lewis or Jeffrey Wright.
I got into theater at an early age.
Researching Magic Johnson, I realized I clearly haven't done enough with my life.
I've been a fan of Loretta Devine's, since I was a kid, from 'Waiting To Exhale,' and she's been in so many of my favorite movies and television shows.
Theater and sports are connected. You've got your team - or ensemble - your goal and your determination to win.
