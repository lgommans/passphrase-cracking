I majored in theater in college. I did a couple of plays in high school, and I really enjoyed it, so I went to Illinois Wesleyan University and got a degree, and then I went back to Chicago and started doing theater in all the companies around the city for about 11 years before I moved out to L.A.
I love Brian De Palma.
You read the stories about horses being starved at Santa Anita, but a horse can't starve at Santa Anita! I mean, there's just bags of carrots all over the place; food is everywhere. They don't starve any horses!
I don't think I auditioned for 'Ghostbusters II'.
Strictly by the nature of 'Veep,' in any given moment, a lot can go wrong.
I'm not from that world where you get on your feet and somebody gives you a suggestion and you improv your way through things.
On a film, they'll always say there's going to be a rehearsal period, and there never is.
