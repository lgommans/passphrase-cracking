Adaptability is crucial to working on Glee because every day is adapting to something. Because we're doing a different genre of music, doing a different type of scene with a different scene partner, recording and dance rehearsals... no day is like another.
James Morrison just had a new album come out and I think he's incredible. I'd love to work with him, his voice is insane.
In San Paulo I went to the movies and by the time I left the theater there was a mob at the exit. I had never been in that kind of situation when we weren't on tour and there was a whole bunch of security. I'm a little dude, and out of nowhere to have 50 or 60 people come running towards me when I'm jut with my friend, it was kind of scary.
I have a sweet tooth problem. On tour, in catering, the dessert was always so good. When we started the tour I was in the best shape of my life, but by the end of it I was horrible.
I love chocolate mousse, that's probably my favorite. I'm a big strawberry shortcake fan as well. I'm not mad at classic vanilla either. I'm not, I'm not sure what the word is. Cake discriminatory? Cakeist?
I sang before I acted, but I always wanted to do them simultaneously.
People aren't paying to see the Kevin McHale show, they're paying to see the cast of 'Glee.'
I would love to do film someday, but I think we are all so happily in tune with 'Glee' that we are sticking with that right now.
I am up for anything, but my favorite show in the whole world is this English series, 'Skins.' It would be awesome to be able to go on that somehow.
I'm scared to see myself in 3D.
'Talk to me,' it's what you say to someone to let them know you're there. Just three simple words. But saying them out loud could help save a life.
