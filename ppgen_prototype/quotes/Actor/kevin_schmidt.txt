American,Actor
I have my writing and acting and producing and directing, and my younger brother has his music and his acting.
I've been home-schooled since I was in the fifth grade, mainly because I had two brothers who were acting. We were from Kansas but moved out to Los Angeles.
It was actually my older brother who wanted to start acting. He would point at the TV as a kid and tell my mom he wanted to do it, and he would act his favorite scenes from 'Home Alone.'
When I was a little younger, I realized acting is a wonderful craft, and it's wonderful when you are working.
I learned how to eat right and learned portion control and how to exercise. Staying persistent over the years, I have been able to change the way I'm perceived on the outside.
I have my character actor side as a kid and my more leading man side. It's all been beneficial.
