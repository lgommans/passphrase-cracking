American,Actor
I shut up and keep my ears and eyes open.
Watching a good actor is the best way to learn.
I don't know how long I'll be trick or treating. Maybe I'll be 80 years old and still trick or treating.
When I worked on Altar Boys, they wanted to see us having fun. The four of us would have fun on set and steal each other's lines, and mess with the director.
They put me in a whole body suit, from my neck to my ankles. It was so bad, I couldn't straighten my legs.
The whole family is tight. We all really love each other.
The Professional Children's School, it's for professional kids, so if you wanted to ditch, you could just write, Audition on a note and leave. I didn't really like school all that much.
The divorce was rough on all of us. I don't blame Hollywood for my family's problems. But having all of it reported in the press made it more of an ordeal.
It was a lot of auditions and tapings and stuff like that.
Igby was a really good opportunity for me to grow up. The cast was great.
I think people are going to keep asking me about Macaulay. Some things change and some things don't.
I see Igby as my first movie as an adult, and it's a big deal for me because I really, really like the film.
I liked a lot of the scenes I did with Ryan Phillippe.
I feel different than I did three years ago, in The Cider House Rules.
A week before shooting, they told me, You don't have the part, yet. We're still trying to find a handicapped kid who can act. Either that or we break your legs.
