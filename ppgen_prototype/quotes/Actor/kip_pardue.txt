No one ever taught me how to shave; no one ever sat down to watch a Braves game with me. I paid for Yale myself, I lived by myself, I taught myself how to play the guitar. I did this all on my own.
I don't need anyone else, which is a great feeling, but also a depressing one.
I feel like I'm just doing a job. It's amazing to think that you affect other peoples' lives on such a grand scale. I'm so thankful for that, and I'm so lucky. It's hard to stop and think that people are interested in me.
