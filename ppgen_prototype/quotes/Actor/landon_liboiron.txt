The first thing I always look at on a girl is her eyes.
I would love to have a go at a band or some form of music one day.
I freakin' hate Twitter, man. I honestly don't understand the purpose of it.
I was never a person who dated in high school, because at 17, everything just felt like it had to be so rushed. Relationships just bounced around like crazy in high school! And now, I never want to rush anything. I just want to enjoy all of the steps.
My whole family is really close. I'm lucky for that.
TV is starting to become such a collective experience again. People are watching it on their own time, rather than being on a schedule. Netflix offers the easy opportunity to watch as much as you can.
I guess my favorite artists are The White Stripes or Tom Waits. The more theatrical the music is, the more I get into it. I also like the quieter folk music, that kind of old-school rockabilly or country. I'm not really picky when it comes to music, as long as it's honest.
