American,Actor
I dug the idea that I was being perceived as the black sheep of my family, but for me, it was like, I was a rebel, and that to me was most important.
I always see that there's a - from a philosophical point of view - there's the appearance of things that everybody wants you to think is happening, then there's the reality underneath it.
My biggest influences as an actor were Marlon Brando, and I really dug James Dean.
The first bike that I bought was a Triumph 650. I really like the Triumph 650. I mean, of course, I've driven Harleys, and I think in 'Savage Seven' I drove an Indian, but - I really love Triumph.
With all due respect to the people who made the motorcycle movies during the '60s, I felt the sophistication level could be a bit higher, and I felt I could raise the bar on that, too.
I've met a lot of people since I was around four years old, some really big ones along the way, and I don't think I've met anyone who's as generous of spirit as Quentin Tarantino.
I went to Phoenix, Arizona for 'Angel Unchained,' and they'd hire the bike gang from Phoenix to be extras in the movie.
I got it into my head that I was going to be starring in movies that I wrote, so that's what I did. I stopped acting in all things, and I wrote my first script, which was optioned a week after I finished it.
