Danish,Actor
Here in Denmark, you can easily just be left alone. This is my 'hood, and people leave me alone; it's nice.
I didn't really understand what you did when you went in front of the camera. And then suddenly I just understood it. When you're in a play, you carry the story, but you don't have to do that in film.
Denmark is, like, the flattest country on Earth.
I think you could find some waves on the west side of Denmark, but I never tried it.
Language is fun; it's fun to try.
I was in the military, and then I went to university to study biology.
I had to spend a few years learning how to do movies. I wasn't really good at that. I was a theatre actor first and foremost. So I took my time learning that.
I would be the worst biologist in the world!
