You bring a little bit of yourself into every character you play. We're multifaceted creatures.
I started out in theater and then I got a job on a soap in New York.
I love the show 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia;' that's probably a guilty pleasure! I laugh so hard.
Why are people always shooting zombies? Why not just chop their heads off? How can zombies get you if you have a good sword?
I started out with a business and psychology major, and then I started doing plays and concentrating more and more on theater. I dropped out of college and moved to New York and studied theater at The Neighborhood Playhouse. I did that for a couple of years and then got an agent.
Only be an actor if you can't be happy doing anything else. I don't think you should be an actor if you want to be actor. I think you should be an actor if you have to be an actor.
I started out in theater, and then I got a job on a soap in New York. With a soap opera, its every day, all year long - there's no downtime, and you're shooting a show a day.
I've done so many Lifetime movies; at this point, I'll be going through airport security, and the lady there will be like, 'I took the weekend off and I saw four of your movies.' And I say: 'You've been watching Lifetime, right?'
