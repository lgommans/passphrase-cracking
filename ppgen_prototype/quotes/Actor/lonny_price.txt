Every actor has a different language. Every actor has their strengths and their challenges, and I try to help them and support them and help them through their challenges as best I can.
There are certainly things in live broadcasts that I've done that I wish I could have gone back to edit and make better. It's hard, because you want it to be perfect, and it just isn't. Even in the edited ones, it's not everything you want it to be - but it's closer.
I think there is a price to being alone, and there is a price to being in a relationship. It all depends on which price you want to pay - but none of them are free.
I sure hope there will be more theatre on television and in the movie theaters. I do have to say, the idea of theatre in movie theaters is really exciting to me.
There's no question about it: the best theatre is collaboration. The best anything is collaboration.
I just try to direct in a way that interests me. And, hopefully, other people will find it compelling.
I grew up in Queens, and part of my birthday gift, always, was a Saturday matinee of whatever hit musical there was. When I was three, I saw 'Oliver!'.
When I was old enough to take myself into the city, in the 1970s, I really grew up on all the great Sondheim-Hal Prince shows.
