My mission in life was to make sure that there were no women walking around who didn't know me personally.
There are so many cameras. There is so much instant media attention, not just for celebrities, but for normal people that get thrust in the reality world.
I'm not too secure about my looks. They can always change. I was heavy and overweight as a teenager, so it's hard to be cocky or egotistical.
Nothing is inevitable with relationships.
