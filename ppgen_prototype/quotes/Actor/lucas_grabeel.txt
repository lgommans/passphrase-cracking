American,Actor
The greatest thing about where my life is right now is it's very relaxed and chill. I'm just hanging out, being myself and doing my work.
I'm competitive with myself, but not with other people. I set goals for myself. I don't really care about winning or losing as long as I do my best.
Success is the most important to many, to me it's just a bonus.
I play, like, 12 instruments. Guitar, piano, harmonica, African drums... I'm working on mastering the accordion.
Every day it seems like something happens to assure me I'm in the right place, and that doing anything else would be wrong. I feel so incredibly blessed.
I don't care about money or fame or anything like that, but it would be a perk.
As far as my dreams go, all I want to do is be a working actor, and I happily achieved that.
I always wish life could be a musical. One person just says 5, 6, 7, 8.
I dislike math, yet I respect and appreciate the fact that math is the language of the universe.
I grew up with the classics. My mom and I would sit and watch 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'White Christmas' - those kind of movies.
I hope to be a producer, a musician, a painter, a photographer - I'm going to push myself to do as many things as I can and see where it goes.
I really want to do more mature, artistic, twisted, edgy films. That is my goal.
In high school, I was Mr. Choir Boy. I had solos, I was helping out the tenors with their parts and our choir teacher would ask me what songs we should do.
It's nice to know you're working on something that will mean something to kids.
