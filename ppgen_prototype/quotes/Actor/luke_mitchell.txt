At one point in time or another, everyone's an outcast, and you have to deal with those sort of issues in society. Especially for teenage kids, I don't think there's anyone that's really been through childhood and not been an outcast in one way or another.
I think every character I play definitely has parts of me. I can't ever play someone that's completely different to me.
I never did drama at school. I did it for one term, when it was compulsory, and I hated it. Tennis was the main thing in my life, and I was not open to anything else. When I removed tennis from the equation, I didn't know who I was.
My favorite group growing up was 'The Hobbit.' It was the first book I actually finished. One of those adventure things that takes you to that land and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. I am not a huge book reader.
I have quite an eclectic taste in music. I like Angus & Julia Stone; they are an Australian brother/sister duo. I like Adele. She is phenomenal.
Considering the 'Tomorrow People' are supposed to be the next step in human evolution, I think it's a fascinating idea that they can't kill. They've evolved in all these other ways, and they have these special abilities, but they can't kill. It's a very interesting concept. I really like it. I like the idea of it.
I do weights and work out different body parts on different days. I don't do cardio - I did too much in my tennis-playing days!
I got to a stage where tennis was the only thing in my life, and I didn't like that.
I try to stay away from processed foods. I eat lean meats and get as many veggies as I can on my plate, so when mum calls me on a Sunday, I can tell her I'm eating enough veggies! I love pasta, but I don't eat carbs a whole lot, and I love fruit.
