American,Actor
Hell, I'm an old man. I'm 70 years old. I'm supposed to be sitting on a rocking chair watching the sunset.
I imagine there are things I wouldn't do, but I haven't been offered those recently either.
But I'm an actor and I like to just keep working.
No, I'm not a horse better. Every once in a while somebody will give me a sure thing and of course it's not.
But I've worked where they've had animals before, and animal wranglers, the people who raise animals and train animals for films and television, they're all very, very professional.
I'm impressed with how professional they are and what they can get an animal to do. I mean, dogs and cats - that's one thing. But when you get into the larger animals, that's a different thing all together.
