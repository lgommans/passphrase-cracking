British,Actor
The thing about this business is that you always end up finding these amazing stories and these amazing people who make amazing films. I just want to work with good people and keep challenging myself with different kinds of characters.
Luckily, there is a wind of change happening in Hindi cinema. Good work is coming to people who are not conventionally good looking like Ranbir Kapoor or Akshay Kumar.
When you're on set, you have to perform and look the part.
It's a great challenge to get to play a real-life character. Every actor would love to get a chance, at least once in his life, to play a real-life character.
Obviously, after every film you do, you wonder what you're going to do next.
Things are looking up, and hopefully, I will be doing good roles in both Hollywood and Bollywood.
I worked in SRK and Salman Khan's films as a child artiste, so Bollywood has always been on my radar.
Luckily, I have been offered the chance to play a South American, Hispanic and even a character from the Middle East in films. There are also a lot of TV series in the U.S. that have a strong presence of actors from India.
There is a lot of Indian connect in 'Million Dollar Arm'. It is about two Indian boys, and we even shot quite a bit of the movie in India.
Jon Hamm is such an amazing co-star. He used to set the tune of the scenes so easily, and in his free time, he didn't mind giving us cues. We picked up a lot from him.
