I'll give you an example. Henry, the old black guy who cooks the corn bread, he worked on the railroads for about 20 years so he knows how to lay and build track.
We didn't have a drill so he would burn the holes through the wood with a metal rod that he heated up in a fire. Can you imagine an ordinary crew doing that?
I never wanted to be a film director but after this experience I really loved it. I would love to do more documentaries but it's difficult to find backing for them.
