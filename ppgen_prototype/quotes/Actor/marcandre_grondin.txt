Canadian,Actor
People forget that there are villages and communities that are still speaking French all over Canada. I went to a bar and spoke with some French people there, and they were saying: 'I went to English school, but at home it was always French, and that's going to be the way it is for my kids.' It's important for them to keep that language alive.
I think everyone in their life has some point on their life wanted to be like everybody else or wanted to be like the captain of the football team.
I started acting when I was three years old, so I was able to see the inside before seeing the wrapping; I wasn't seeing, like, the way tabloids make people.
I never saw an actor and thought, 'Wow, I want to be like that.' It's just I wanted it to be part of my life.
I'm okay with myself. I had times when I was 15 about 'Who I am?' and 'What am I?' and where I want to go, and that's behind me.
