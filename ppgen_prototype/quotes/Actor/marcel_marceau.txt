French,Actor
In silence and movement you can show the reflection of people.
To communicate through silence is a link between the thoughts of man.
It's good to shut up sometimes.
Music conveys moods and images. Even in opera, where plots deal with the structure of destiny, it's music, not words, that provides power.
Do not the most moving moments of our lives find us without words?
Music and silence combine strongly because music is done with silence, and silence is full of music.
Never get a mime talking. He won't stop.
I have designed my style pantomimes as white ink drawings on black backgrounds, so that man's destiny appears as a thread lost in an endless labyrinth. I have tried to shed some gleams of light on the shadow of man startled by his anguish.
What sculptors do is represent the essence of gesture. What is important in mime is attitude.
