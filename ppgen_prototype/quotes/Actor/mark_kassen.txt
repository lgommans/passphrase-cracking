Algerian,Actor
I've never known how to censor myself. I say what I want at any time.
Basically, I see myself as a maker of things who knows how to support other makers of things. At the end of the day, I am just committed to helping put good stories out into the world in whatever role is appropriate and needed for that particular project.
