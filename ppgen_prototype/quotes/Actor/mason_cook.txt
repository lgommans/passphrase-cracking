American,Actor
If I wasn't acting, all I'd do is ride my bike. I've always loved doing that.
I love being an actor, especially in movies, because you get to be someone else.
Everyone probably says this, but my favorite athlete is Tony Hawk. I'd really love to meet him.
In all of my press junkets for 'Spy Kids,' I was saying that my two favorite actors are Johnny Depp and Steve Carell. And I ended up getting to work with both of them.
It was a dream come true working with Johnny Depp. He's always been my acting idol. Working with him and watching him work taught me a lot as an actor. He's very down to earth and a lot of fun to hang out with.
