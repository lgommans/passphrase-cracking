American,Actor
I'm fascinated by beautiful scenery and what we have here on this Earth.
I want someone that I can have fun with and laugh with. I love to laugh, and I'm really sarcastic, so it's important that she can take a joke. I think if you are going to be with someone for a while, you really need someone you can let loose with and let go of all the stress of the day.
I'm a bit of a gadget freak.
I believe in the Bible, and I believe in Jesus. It's a big part of my life.
I do think 'The Notebook' is a darn good movie.
I don't feel guilty about it, but I love me some 'Modern Family.'
I honestly try not to eat a whole lot of fast food, so it wouldn't kill me to drop it all together.
Voice acting is very creative, especially 'Star Wars' voice acting, because there's so much you have to imagine.
I'm a huge sci-fi geek, and I also really get into all of the alien shows on the History Channel where you see air force pilots talking about UFOs - I love that stuff.
If I wasn't an actor, I probably would've tried to get a job with the Braves.
I don't really like the word 'religion.' To me, that's like rules and regulations and paying money to send up prayers. That kind of all weirds me out, honestly.
There are so many possibilities of life out there that an alien doesn't have to have green, long tentacles. They can be very similar to us.
I'm an outdoorsy person. I really enjoy the hiking in L.A.
I love the magic of movies and television, and I always have since I was kid.
