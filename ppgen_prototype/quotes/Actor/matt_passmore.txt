Australian,Actor
I grew up in suburban Brisbane, so to say you wanted to be an actor was a ridiculous concept.
We're used to boy meets girl, boy likes girl, instant attraction on TV. But you throw a son in there, you throw a marriage in there, and you've got some really good character stuff.
'The Glades' is a light cop procedural about a cop from Chicago who got shot in the bum by his captain and made a change down to Florida, so he's a bit of a fish out of water.
It doesn't matter how much I think I know about Florida, it still flips me on the head every time. It's just an absurd, eclectic place, and the stories that can come out of that place just never stop.
There is a 90% failure rate for most shows. It's difficult for any show to write for the next season.
I like playing characters that have a prickly armor because when you start to see the cracks and some heart come out, it gives the audience something to look forward to.
My parents would never put too much hype into anything. They're very proud of me, but they're Queensland people. They're just glad that I have a job.
You have to just enjoy yourself sometimes, and the audience will, too. Not every role has to be 'The Taming of the Shrew.'
