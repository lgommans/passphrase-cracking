American,Actor
Since I've been in an actor, I've lived in Italy, in London, in Stockholm - I had the fortune of working in different locations. If you live someplace long enough, you acquire slightly different systems of thought, and it influences your outlook on life. I just slowly adapted the way I speak.
The typical Western is kind of a good-guy/bad-guy thing, and that's great, but initially when I heard about 'Into the West,' and what I love about it is it delves into both sides of our cultural past, and it puts more of a human face on the Native Americans.
Anytime you can be a part of something that hopefully tries to make a cultural contribution, I love the idea of that.
I'm secretly a clown, or maybe it's not much of a secret! I'm a little putzo, as the Italians say - a little bit loopy.
I want to play the Green Lantern. I'd love to do a comic book hero. Go to the gym, get all buff, puff up. That would be a lot of fun.
I am a total geek. I'm not even a closet comic book geek. I am the comic book geek.
I went to theater school but never really got the chance to do theater, and it's always been a dream of mine.
