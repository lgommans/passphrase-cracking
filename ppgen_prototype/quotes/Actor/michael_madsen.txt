You know, every movie you make can't be great, no matter who you are.
I probably made a few pictures I shouldn't have done, but I have four sons and I have to pay the rent. If you have a decision to make about whether or not you can buy groceries at the market or whether or not you're going to make a bad movie, you're going to make a bad movie.
Is it really selling out if it feeds your family?
Well, one thing for sure, I won't be remembered for 'Free Willy.' Or maybe I will.
Kids are a great excuse for you to stop acting like one.
Encourage your kids' artistic side. Toughen up everything else.
Your children don't have to fear you to respect you.
My career has been very strange. My career is like a heart monitor. I get involved in a good project now and then to keep things going. And then I make things that I work on that I hope are going to be good so I can make a living and keep a roof over the heads of those little monsters I have in my house.
