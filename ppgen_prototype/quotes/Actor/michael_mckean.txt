That's a job that it makes a few friendships, but it probably breaks more.
I'm all over the place. As you may have seen from the credits, I write with everybody.
I'm kind of the town pump. I think I have a pretty good ear for what sounds good in this style.
The process depends on the situation, and I don't think there are any two songs that have gone exactly the same way... well, actually, that's not true.
They were kind of like little Stephen King stories... but these go back many hundreds of years.
You know, I think it's one of those cases where the situation really does dictate your level of ridicule.
Even when there are banalities, they're usually kind of benign banalities.
I think you have everyone kind of pulling on the same end of the rope. It's not like you're Robin Williams and everyone else is a deaf mute. It's like - there's plenty of help.
Some people stay in the academic world just to avoid becoming self-aware. You can quote me on that.
I made some friends who are still friends, and this is the city of my birth. I love living here when there's a reason to, other than just moving here. I still don't like the winters here, but it's an amazing city and I love it.
When we can figure out a way to really tour and make a profit, then we'll do it again.
Sometimes we drop in and do an acoustic set somewhere, and that's really fun to take all these insanely loud songs, and to do them quiet. It's really a sight to see... or to hear!
