I delivered my son. There were other people with me, but I was actively involved.
I just like to talk to people. I don't know how to bridge the gap between getting to know someone and then schmoozing and sort of working contacts and business connections.
I had started doing theater in high school, and while I was doing that, I got my manager.
It's amazing... to enjoy the results of your labor.
My girlfriend in eighth grade had been asking her friends when I was going to kiss her. At a dance, my buddy said, 'You better do it now!' I went in for it. I felt like the coolest person on the face of the earth. A week or two later, she broke up with me.
