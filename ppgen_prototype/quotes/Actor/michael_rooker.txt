American,Actor
I don't approach a role by saying I'll be unsavory or unlikable.
'Cliffhanger' got me in the best shape of my life, working at 10,000 feet up in the mountains. And everybody was great. I lived in Italy for seven months doing that movie. It was a great vacation.
I think all the roles I've done have been very passionate people who go to absolute extremes to make their points.
I got my training here in Chicago at the Goodman School Of Drama, and a lot of my personal work is usually internal work and stuff. Everything else that goes on is icing on the cake - your wardrobe, your makeup, whatever else you have to do.
Horror fans need horror, okay? They don't need little worms squirming around going down your throat. To them, that's not horror.
I learned how to turn it on and turn it off. You learn that in theater, too, but for film work, I learned from doing 'Henry,' I learned how to leave work at work and go home. There's always spillover. Actors speak of this.
When you think of it I haven't really done a lot of horror. It's amazing: I have done some really good ones, but I haven't done a lot of them.
You know how it is, somebody will see your work and like it and remember it, then decide to make it a role in their film.
