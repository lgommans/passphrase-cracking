I will argue with anyone in New York: we have the best pizza in Chicago and the best blues.
I had just gotten to the point when I could have bought any car I wanted to in America. I even looked at a Hummer. But one day I woke up and realized, how can I talk the talk without walking the walk? If you can feel good about not contributing to global change, then all the power to you, but I couldn't.
Tarzan is such a great character in that he's very innocent and wide-eyed about the world, yet he's so powerful and capable. It's fun to play those qualities simultaneously in the same person.
It's great that we can, however subtly, offer important lessons through cartoons that it's important to protect the environment.
It's a wonderful acting challenge to tell a story and convey emotion with only your voice.
I just don't think you can lump television shows together.
I came into this business to create characters that moved people and told stories.

Auditioning is a good thing; it keeps you humble.
I've spent a lot of my career playing heroes, like Jared in 'The Pretender,' but playing part of a dysfunctional family is more interesting.
I've always felt very blessed and lucky in the world, and I have great compassion for people who struggle to get through the day.
Sometimes, you have to remind yourself that some people are just trying to find something to eat.
