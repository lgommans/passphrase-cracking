French,Actor
I hate gold. I'm sort of a sterling-silver guy.
Every actor will tell you it's so much more fun to play the bad guy because usually those characters are more complex and more broad and more interesting, and have more sides to them.
I would rather do movies because I'm very lazy and the hours are much easier.
I'm not a bling-bling guy; I can't pull it off. I just look like an idiot.
I wish I were a character actor. Of course, if I played hockey without a mask, I could become one.
You just have to keep plugging away and if you get lucky enough to get a job, you get one.
You never know why or when the next job is coming. I actually like that. It's kind of exciting. I don't punch in. I don't have a 9 to 5 job. When you do work you're lucky enough to go to interesting places and meet mostly interesting and talented people, so it's really a great job if you can work.
I think the hardest thing about being an actor is between jobs when you don't know and wondering if you'll ever work again. It's kind of a crazy business.
I've always loved sports and hockey is a sport I play as much as I can. I love it. In a weird way it's like church and therapy and exercise all rolled up into one. I mean when I play hockey I don't think about anything.
