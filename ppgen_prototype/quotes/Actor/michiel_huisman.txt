Dutch,Actor
TV has gotten perhaps better than your average film script, but at the same time, it's fun to give it all you've got for a few months and produce a story.
To play different characters on a TV show where you're working every day, playing multiple characters every day, it's so ridiculously intense.
I guess I was a child actor. Acting was one of the things I did alongside going to school: I'd be playing guitar, I'd be playing soccer, and I would be acting in movies.
I learned English at school, or at least that's how it started. Also, in Holland - as opposed to some other European countries - we don't dub anything, so as a kid growing up, always watching English and American movies in their original language really helped.
The Dutch film industry is a pretty small community, so within Holland, I think most actors know each other and have worked with each other.
Rutger Hauer is a very famous Dutch actor who did quite a lot internationally. Another Dutch actress who is working a lot is called Famke Janssen. There's a few more.
One of the fun things as an actor is to really spread your wings as wide as possible and do a variety of roles. I've been really lucky in that sense, I think.
Growing up in Holland, I always thought my name was boring, but in the U.S., all of a sudden I have a very cool name.
