Spanish,Actor
I can remember exactly where I was when I saw 'The Matrix' for the first time.
I belong to a generation that has seen the explosion of freedom, the celebration of freedom.
I studied physical therapy, and I started to study theater because my aunt is a theater director.
In Spain, after the dictatorship, thanks to Pedro Almodovar, many artists put on the streets through art a big explosion of freedom.
