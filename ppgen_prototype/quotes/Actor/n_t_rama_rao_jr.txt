I love being called NTR's grandson. I never moved away from his shadow, maybe because I didn't try enough or maybe because I like it this way.
I don't want to waste my energy in other things; instead, I would put all that in reaching the next level in a craft that I love the most.
I am a very shy person who is just close to himself. So I would refrain from talking about my personal life.
I believe in doing what I am best at.
