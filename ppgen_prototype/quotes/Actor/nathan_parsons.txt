I probably use email the most. I dunno if that counts as an app. I try to stay off my electronics as much as possible. Real life is happening all around you; you're better off just being a part of it.
Honestly, I'm not interested in gossip. Thing is, I know a lot of successful actors, and in hoping to be successful myself, I would like to think others would respect my privacy.
I try to get to the gym whenever I can, eat healthy, mostly protein and vegetables, avoid processed sugar and minimize carbs, but I don't feel like I need to go crazy if I want pasta now and then.
I don't think I do look like an A-Lister. I'm more interested in being comfortable in my own skin than trying to be somebody I'm not. Gimme jeans, an old T-shirt, cowboy boots and a baseball cap any day.
When you love somebody, and they have a child, you love their child. You just accept it as a part of who they are, and you care about them and theirs.
I've used my time at 'GH' to learn some discipline.
In L.A., you constantly go on auditions, and you're usually not what they're looking for - you get used to going back and back to the same show, and nothing happens.
As a kid, I was obsessed with myths and legends and the haunting beauty of gothic stories.
I had auditioned for 'The Vampire Diaries' years ago before 'The Originals' happened, so I was familiar with that mythology.
I was so worried when I left 'GH:' so scared I'd never work again.
