Canadian,Actor
I'm not of a science background, I was never a comic book geek, and I was never a gamer.
I'm a little bit of a gypsy myself. I've always had jobs where I'm moving around and I'm not sure what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day.
I started off as a director, so when I see other actors directing, it gives me hope that maybe they'll put me into that position at some point, too.
I'm an intellectual, but I've always had jobs that required physical labor above all else.
