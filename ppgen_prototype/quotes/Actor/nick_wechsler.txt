Being funny has always mattered a lot to me. It's why I started acting - to make my friends laugh.
Any story about revenge is ultimately a story about forgiveness, redemption, or the futility of revenge.
There is part of me that will always feel wrong for any leading man-type, charming guy or whatever. I am not that guy. I am so weird. I say inappropriate things, and if I have any charm at all, it's in my utter lack of charm.
I don't always expect good from people. I always expect the bad and I am pleasantly surprised when they are nice.
I feel lucky to be doing TV right now because I get another chance every day.
I go to movies and concerts and stuff - that's why I think all my money would be gone if I weren't working because I just keep spending it, on that, and CDs, and I don't know.
Personally, I don't go and seek contact with fans, but if they happen to find me somewhere I'll say hello and speak to them for a while.
