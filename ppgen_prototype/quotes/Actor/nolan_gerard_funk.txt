Canadian,Actor
There are times where people ask for a lock of your hair, but the truth is I have a lot of gratitude for my fans.
I went to a dentist for a toothache, and it turned out his kids were in an acting school. We talked about it, and I decided to enroll at the same school. I was 14. I guess you could say I just got lucky.
If you're one of the Disney kids, it's like you have to talk about having a promise ring, you know?
I think I started toddler gymnastics when I was around 3 or 4, and I began taking it seriously when I was 6.
My goal has been to be a great character actor.
If people can see you in a film and not realize it's you until the very end, that's exciting to me.
My biggest fantasy as an actor is to be in situations that make me uncomfortable and force me out of my comfort zone.
I love the idea of renaissance. If my career is like painting a canvas, I want to have as many different colors in there as I can.
