'Ender's Game' is fantastic, and I've gotten to see quite a few bits, and I love the way it's turned out.
Harrison Ford invited me to fly on his private plane to Los Angeles, and he's great to work with. He's really down to earth, and we got to know each other quite well.
As soon as I started acting in England, I got unusual roles. Although I'm 6 foot six, and agents might standardly cast me in tough guy roles or the big guy in the back, I've been very blessed to do roles that makes them think twice about how they're gonna cast me.
I want to do primarily film and theater; I always want to do a play because it feeds my soul. It's like an exercise on stage.
I consider myself a man of the world; I connect very strongly with Nigeria, but I see that the work exists all over the world, and I will go where the work is.
I wouldn't say I'm moving to America; I certainly would say that I'm just staying there; and I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to come here unless they've got an extensive CV in the U.K.; you have to build your career wherever you started from.
