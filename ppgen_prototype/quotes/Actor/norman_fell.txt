American,Actor
If I could do it all over again, I'd be the mailman. I love housewives, and I hate dogs. What more is there?
I enjoyed acting and marveled that one could get paid for doing it.
Hollywood sucks. I've got the bruises to prove it.
This hook nose and crab meister attitude has gotten me every job I've ever had. And more divorces than I care to remember.
I had a lot of time to think in the service; I swore that, if I survived, nothing would keep me from an acting career.
I was rejected by casting directors during the day. I attended class in the evening, then rode 90 miles on the train home.
