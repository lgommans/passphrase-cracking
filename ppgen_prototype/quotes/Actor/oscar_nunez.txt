Quality attracts quality. People want to be on a good show.
I watched TV religiously when I was a kid, but nowadays - with the Internet - there's so many people writing about TV on the Internet, that everything's sort of under a magnifying glass.
I like game shows.
I still use quill and parchment. I do e-mails, and I write, but I don't go around surfing too much.
I'm pretty much a straight guy on 'The Office.' We can't all be crazies. You need some balance.
I've always loved improv. It's my thing.
I am Cuban, my parents are Cuban, and I was not adopted.
I've always just been attracted to comedy.
Stand-up, I find it really difficult. It's not really my thing.
I like freedom. I wake up in the morning and say, 'I don't know, should I have a popsicle or a donut?' You know, who knows?
Life in California is beautiful.
Yeah, I just don't break. I don't. And there's only one person I know who's a better non-breaker than me, and that's Will Forte from 'SNL.' You can not make that guy break. I'll break eventually - Will Forte will never break.
Ricky Gervais is a genius.
I remember, growing up, if something big - God forbid - happened, the first jokes you heard on the subject came out of Jersey.
