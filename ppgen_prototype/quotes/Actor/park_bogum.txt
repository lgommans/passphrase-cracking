South Korean,Actor
I can't take the subway anymore. I think I can still take the bus, though. It's a double-edged sword because I'm grateful that people recognize and support me, but there are definite downsides to that.
It's not the moment yet for me to enjoy my time as an actor, and as the time goes by, I feel that I need to push myself harder to pay back for all the good fortune that I have received.
Most superhero characters we see these days are from foreign countries. I would like to play a superhero that shows off Korean power.
When I was young, I really wanted to be a part of the end-of-year awards shows, but now that I'm actually there, it feels weird. I used to go to church and ended the year with a prayer, but now I spend it with people I'm not very familiar with at an award show, and I wonder if it's something I should be doing.
When I'm not in front of the camera, I'm just like any other normal person. I'm a student. I eat when I'm stressed.
Before, I could meet and greet all my fans one by one, but now, it's hard to remember all of their names. And my actions can sometimes cause misunderstandings. If I bow to one side, I've heard people from the other side ask why I didn't bow there.
My original dream was to become a singer-songwriter, so I sent a video of myself playing the piano and singing to all the big agencies.
Ultimately, I want to be a good person and spread happiness through my acting. If I don't forget to be appreciative and thankful, then that would be the most important thing that I'll ever achieve.
