American,Actor
I don't want to be a star. If you have to label me anything, I'm an actor - I guess. A journeyman actor. I think 'star' is what you call actors who can't act.
A writer can write in an attic, or on top of a bus. Or with a sharp stick in some wet cement. To act, an actor has to have words. A stage. a camera turning.
I've never tried to learn the art of acting. I have been in the business for years but I still can't tell what acting is or how it's done.
I'm about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover.
Nature's far too subtle to repeat herself.
I won't go up in a plane, but if a play crashes, I'll jump into the next one that comes along and take it up for a spin.
