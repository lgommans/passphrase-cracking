American,Actor
I think any girl would throw me under a bus to be within five feet of Robert Pattinson. I actually think he's an attractive guy. And I watched most of 'Twilight,' and I think he was really intriguing.
The thing I love about being an actor is the ability to travel and experience new cultures.
I don't have television so I don't watch TV.
What doesn't confuse me about what women wear? When it comes to women's fashion I'm so oblivious. I have no idea what's going on.
When I was 18 I was just absorbing everything around me: whatever happens, happens. I was so naive and willing to ride whatever wave life threw at me.
I'm pretty neurotic.
I think any time anybody sees the bad guy show emotion and you're not hitting the audience over the head, there's always a tinge of empathy for that individual.
I've had cameos on some cool shows.
I wasn't some weird loner in school, but I definitely wasn't invited to any of the cool parties.
I played ice hockey obsessively for 14 years of my life.
'Catcher in the Rye' changed my life when I was a kid. I read it as I was a boy turning into a man, and I was so fascinated by the values. I believe in it.
