American,Actor
Acting very quickly became a dream of mine, but the acting game privileges youth. It takes a while to build credits and, because of that, it's not the kind of career you can jump into in your 40s or 50s. The ship sets sail by then.
I was very fortunate to be raised with an 'if not you, then who?' mentality, and I count my blessings every day to have the support of my family and especially my wife. She's got a front-row seat on the roller coaster.
It was a real sort of synergistic 'Aha!' moment when I started acting.
Working on a big-budget summer blockbuster with a built-in fan base is a dream come true for any actor.
