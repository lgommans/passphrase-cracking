To stay on the map you've got to keep showing up.
Whether it's on top of a phone booth or a $200 million soundstage, it's about stories.
I made my Broadway debut in the revival of Hair and followed it up with the bus and truck tour of Grease.
When I came up, guys like Nicholson and DeNiro were held in highest regard.
In an attempt to amuse my friends and family, I would do impressions of Dean Martin, singing Everybody Loves Somebody. I secretly really enjoyed singing the song.
My family were broadminded enough to support me when I wanted to pursue a life in the theatre.
I was about to get a degree in economics when I accepted that I'd be a lousy businessman, and if I didn't give acting a try I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
Around 5th and 6th grade I thought Dean Martin was the coolest guy in the world; he was a great singer, had his own television show and acted in movies.
There have been makeup artists who've asked if my eyebrows are real.
Two women? God, man. Well, I'm still living. So clearly I must've gotten away with it, when I did do it. But I don't think it's time to blow my cover now.
My eyebrows make a more profound impact on other people than they do on me. I just let 'em grow.
I love playing a dad. It's hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.
By year three, you get nicer, bigger trailers.
I always go back to theatre. It's probably where I'll draw my last breath.
I feel like I won the Lotto, as far as that show's concerned.
No matter what the role, you're trying to do the impossible - make a living in show business.
Through every moment on stage for the first time, I felt like I was finally right where I belonged.
You can only be stupid when you're young.
I was probably 11 by the time I saw a movie.
