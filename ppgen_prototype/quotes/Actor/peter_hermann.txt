German,Actor
I was born in New York, but I was only here for two months. My parents are German, and I grew up in Germany for my first 10 years.
Language patterns solidify at 10, 11, 12, so I was able to learn English fairly easily, with no accent. I didn't do speech or vocal work to get rid of the German accent; I was just lucky.
I still speak to my parents only in German, and I have endless family over there.
Some days, I just love the physical space of the theater. I love theaters; they are heartbreakingly beautiful to me.
