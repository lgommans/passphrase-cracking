Every director I've ever admired has a beard.
I consider myself a reasonable man. As such, I tend to expect others to behave with a modicum of reason and common sense. Especially those with power.
Melodrama is something that is created... I don't seen a melodramatic episode of '90210' or any show that relies on that and think, 'Oh, that's life. That's how I experience it.'
I just think age is meaningless. It's a system we've all agreed to that supposedly signals when we should develop, reach our peak and go downhill, as they say. It interferes with our natural growth.
