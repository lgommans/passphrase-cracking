What's happened in my career is probably fate and good luck.
I think the bad-guy roles are fun - there are more of them, and they're written more colorfully.
I got agitated at the idea that racism is a Southern thing. Did you hear about the cross-burning out here? A black family moved into an upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb and found a cross burning on their lawn. Swastikas are being painted on synagogues. I'm moving to France. I don't think this 'kinder, gentler nation' bit is working too well.
I never had a prejudiced bone in my body.
I didn't make movies when I was a kid, but I loved them. That was considered a far-fetched dream.
