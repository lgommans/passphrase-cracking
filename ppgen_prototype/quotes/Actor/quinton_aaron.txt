American,Actor
I like to be someone else. I like to be someone other than myself. I grew up watching movies and being a fan of what I'd seen portrayed in the movies, and I always wanted to do that one day.
Having a chance to be someone other than yourself and to act out stuff that makes people look at you, like, wow, and that's why I love acting so much.
I do believe in sending positive messages. I am a Christian, so I do believe in a lot of positive messages.
I grew up in the church. I was raised in the church.
I feel like if I live the Christian life, then the people should be able to see it in my everyday actions.
If I have to degrade myself or do something that I'm not willing to do as a Christian to get something, I'm just not willing to do it.
Growing up, I was not used to good things happening to me.
Being a fan of the business for years and wanting to be an actor for years, I knew, if ever the opportunity came for me, I would already know what to expect. I know what comes along with it. The best thing I can do is take it all in and go with the flow.
