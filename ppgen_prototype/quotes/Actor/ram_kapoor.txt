When you do good work, people will notice you.
Platinum for me signifies everlasting love, which needs to be celebrated in the most special way.
I enjoy all kinds of performances and take each role differently. I keep the audiences in mind.
I love the process of acting, and to turn your passion into a career is the biggest gift.
I think you have to be really lucky to pick the sort of roles you want to do.
My dad is extremely successful, so I've seen the money and luxury growing up. I'm nowhere close to his stature.
You can't take yourself too seriously; it's important to poke fun at yourself. Once in a while, it is great to show your inadequacies, too.
You won't believe it, but for the first two years of our marriage I lived off my wife. Like every self-respecting man, I hated it.
No one wants to work with a difficult star. I want to be the nice guy.
Television has done a lot for me, and I can never stay away from it.
TV and films are same for me. I took a decision to be an actor, and I am an actor. I never decided to be TV actor or film actor.
To get scared is something not in my personality.
TV has grown so much. It is like a powerhouse medium.
My father was never around, and my mother used to worry that the kids won't grow up to be connected to him.
My father is a very successful man in the corporate world, and I am his only son. He had certain dreams for me. I was scared to tell him that I wanted to be an actor.
I do want to lose weight for my children. I don't want them to think being fat is okay.
Before my marriage, I was really wild, and I was very open about it. My wife knows about it. From the age of 19 to 30, I was this mad, wild person. I just wanted to have a good time, not get serious with anyone. I didn't allow relationships to happen, and I made it clear to whoever I was with.
When I am really angry, I clam up, go cold.
