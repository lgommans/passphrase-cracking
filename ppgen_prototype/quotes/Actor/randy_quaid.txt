American,Actor
I love my brother. I miss my brother.
I just always wanted to be left alone to go into a creative space.
When I was a kid and the carnival would come to the shopping centre, I'd go down and talk to all the people running the rides. I like that whole lifestyle, moving from town to town in a nomadic existence.
It's possible for people to gain control of every facet of your life.
Just about every actor wants to be a Disney cartoon voice at some point.
My finances have been decimated by a group of people, such as my ex-attorney, my ex-business manager, and an estate planner, specifically. And they have conspired together to - to co-op my corporations, put in trustees without my knowledge.
I don't trust Santa Barbara as far as I can spit. I am afraid that if I went back there, it's possible that I could be run through their system, their judicial system, and wind up in some county jail where I could be killed and I'm not gonna take that chance.
I'm not crazy. I play a lot of crazy characters, but I'm an actor.
Now with the Internet, a celebrity is fair game, and it's all designed to sell advertising space.
Acting's more of a business for me now.
I went through this delayed-adolescence thing. I didn't want to be tied down to a family.
If you don't stick up for what's yours, and defend what's yours... what are you?
I love Canada.
I would not do anything to besmirch my reputation any further than it has already been.
I've been racketeered on.
I would never walk off any show.
I am being embezzled by a monstrous ring of accountants, estate planners and lawyers who are mercilessly slandering me and trying to kill my career and, I believe, murder me in order to gain control of my royalties.
I love playing characters that are bigger than life and maybe have a darker side that they present to the world. Those are good characters.
What I wish more than anything is that I could start getting press about my work as an actor. That is what I do. I'm not a criminal.
