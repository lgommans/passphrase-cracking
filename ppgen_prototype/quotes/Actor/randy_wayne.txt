American,Actor
I'm very picky about what I'll do and the message the film has in it.
As an actor, I want to build a career as an actor. It's hard to even get a job sometimes, so as my career builds, I can be more picky than I used to be.
John Schneider's cool. I mean, he is the epitome of cool. To be that confident without any chip on his shoulder is very hard to do, and that man just has it. To be that well-known and still be so personable and social, it's just fantastic.
I'm really a big fan of HBO and Showtime shows, so I wouldn't mind being on an edgy show... where I could challenge myself to do gritty stuff - a homeless guy or just some guy with a lot going on who's got problems. It's more fun to do as an actor.
There are so many movies people make just to make money.
I've been lucky because Hollywood can be harsh and try to pigeonhole you. I've done TV, films, and comedy, done it all... I think I'm spread out evenly among the film community. I've been lucky and keep working with great actors.
