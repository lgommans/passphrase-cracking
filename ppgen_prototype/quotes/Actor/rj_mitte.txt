My sister is a mess. I love her to death, but she is a mess.
You can do anything if you set goals. You just have to push yourself.
I don't really say too much to my parents. If they ask me to do something I just do it and get it out of the way.
I wouldn't say in all situations, but a lot of times kids can be the most reasonable people around because they don't have the deal with all the drama that goes along with being an adult.
I always wanted to go into the military or something like that - my whole family, all my friends are either Air Force, Navy, or Marines.
I say, 'You can never use excuses because they always run out.'
I hate being immobile.
I'm actually very active.
One time I semi-wrecked my uncle's truck. He told me to back it up into a ditch, but my foot slipped and I gunned it a little too much. But now I use one foot, and I do not run into stuff - at least I try not to.
I feel bad for people in wheelchairs and people who have to use crutches.
I want to get my Masters in business.
'Breaking Bad' - I've heard that question phrased in many directions, and it always means the same thing. It's when someone can't... when a decent person can't take it any more. They just kind of turn and go in the opposite direction.
I personally don't like school, but you have to do it if you want to get through life, so pretty much I put up with it.
I like to dirt bike ride, four wheeler, go-kart.
I spent a long time away from my parents when I was younger. I would go hunting and fishing with my uncle, and we would go for weeks at a time. I also spent a lot of time in Texas with my grandparents.
The more you travel, the more well-off you'll be, I think.
The people that you have around you are your biggest influence.
I like to work.
