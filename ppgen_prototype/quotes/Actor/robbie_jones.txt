I played basketball. I went to school and played basketball and was trying to pursue that as a career path and kind of just fell into acting.
I was hoping to get to the NBA, but the Lord took me on a different path.
For me, basketball kind of mirrors life. It sounds deep, but the sport has transformed my personality and my daily coping mechanisms. It has meant a lot.
I play the drums, and I'm trying to teach myself how to play the piano.
'Lost' was my favorite show! I'm really sad that it's gone.
