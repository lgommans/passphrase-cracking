American,Actor
The thing about racing that appeals to me is your destiny is in your own hands at that moment.
One of the things I really like about racing is that you can't fake it. As an actor, everything is fake. You're always trying to convince people you can do something you can't. And that's the opposite of racing. The stopwatch never lies.
There are certain people who are supposed to be race car drivers, and I've got that. I've got that thing that makes me have to race. I have to do it.
