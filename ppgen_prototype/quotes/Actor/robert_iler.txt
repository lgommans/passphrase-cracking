I was always handsome under all the fat.
Music is my life.
If you miss one day in physics, that's it.
I've never seen a woman half as beautiful as Jennifer Love Hewitt.
I intentionally aided them by being there and blocking an avenue of escape for the victims.
I never, ever would or did rob anyone in my life.
You get in trouble, you have to evaluate: Is it worth getting into trouble again? It's a lot easier to make that decision when you have a career at stake.
I ate everything - a lot of pizza, bags of chips and boxes of cookies. Now I love chicken, that's all I eat.
I actually just started home schooling. And it is great.
