I often concentrate on the eyes and lips, they are great indicators of mood and feeling, and I find that I can project character into my portraits by bringing the viewer's attention to these areas.
I sometimes use a lot of light greens and greys when I feel there is sadness in the painting.
I know intuitively when the work is right, no training can teach you this, it is simply a matter of feeling.
