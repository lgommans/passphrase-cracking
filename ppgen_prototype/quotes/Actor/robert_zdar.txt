It's important for a villain to be as threatening as possible, whether physically, mentally or emotionally... however you want to do it. If you can combine all three, well, that's the ultimate villain.
People come up to me and say, 'You are such a great bad guy.' The fact is that the antagonist in a movie is usually the most fun to play. You can stretch the role and do so much with it.
I try to change my physical appearance for every role.
