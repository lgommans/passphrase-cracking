British,Actor
I enjoyed being in movies when I was a boy. As a child you're not acting - you believe.
Fortunately, I happened to go east at a time when live television was centered in New York.
I can't say I was unhappy as a child actor in films. I had a particularly wonderful time.
I started to study, because I knew I had to learn a lot about myself as an actor; you can't act the same as you did as a child.
I still have the actor's disease. I always think I'll never get another job.
My whole life I've been trying to prove I'm not just yesterday.
They said I couldn't play anything but an English boy. I knew I could. So I went to New York.
