I really want to work with Hugh Jackman and also Steven Spielberg.
I really want to do a sci-fi movie.
My dad said that if it's part of the character, I'm allowed to say bad words, but if it's not part of the character, and I say it at home when I'm not acting, that I won't be acting anymore.
I just really want to work with Hugh Jackman because he's Wolverine. That would be so awesome.
