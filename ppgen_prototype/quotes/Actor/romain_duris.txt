French,Actor
Most people think I am very nice; they think I'm their friend, which is lucky, but it means you're never allowed to be in a bad mood. They take it personally. The worst is when you're on holiday with your family.
Fame is O.K. I hate it, but it's O.K. I'm beginning to understand how I can be hidden. It's an attitude.
Before I film a movie, I look at how the character will move and walk.
You don't learn acting, you nourish it. I don't regret not going to drama school because I was very afraid of all the lessons. I'm allergic to technicality.
Some actors, they have to carry this macho, very masculine element to them, but it's difficult for me to understand that.
I like to be fragile. I like that. I try to be close to that energy and sensibility.
I think what's very French is the mixture of comedy with intimacy and a kind of reflectiveness. For U.S. audiences, the nearest thing is Woody Allen.
I really like acting in English.
