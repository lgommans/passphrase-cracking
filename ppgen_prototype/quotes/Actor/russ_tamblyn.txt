'West Side Story' was one of the high points of my career. Yet, when I first saw it, I was really disappointed in how I came off.
I first saw 'West Side Story' on stage in 1958. I was in the army, having been conscripted while under contract to MGM. I caught the musical in New York, fell in love with it, bought the album, and memorised the whole thing.
