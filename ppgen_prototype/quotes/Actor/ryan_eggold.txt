Never stop taking risks. Just keep reaching.
People really give you a hard time when you wear fake glasses out to a bar.
You have to figure out 'who am I?' 'What do I want to do?' 'What do I want to say?'
I think all of us could play the teacher because we all grew up with teachers. It's just kind of this peeking-over-the-shoulder presence that we've all grown up knowing.
So many limits in Catholic high school! I'm not a bad Catholic, but everything was off-limits.
I think I'll always prefer theater to working in front of the camera. It seems a more distilled form of the craft.
If I couldn't act, I'd really love to try music.
I play the guitar and the piano and have a group of guys who I play with. They're uber talented.
I never got why actors don't like it when a fan comes up to them on the street. It is cool that someone recognizes what you do and makes you feel like you live in a community.
I love all my fam. I have quite possibly the best dad, mom, and sister in the world.
I'm just a guy who wears TOMS. It's the sad truth.
I wore glasses my whole life, but then I got Lasik eyeball surgery, and I fixed that.
I have numerous clear glasses at home. I probably have thirty pairs. I think it started for acting. I have tons of clothes that just sit there. But if that one role comes up, I'm going to want that shirt. And I have glasses for that, too.
