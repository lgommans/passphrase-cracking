American,Actor
I've been so blessed and so lucky to be a part of great shows like 'Chuck' and projects 'Daybreak.'
I needed the 'Chuck' phase to appreciate the 'Captain Awesome' phase because otherwise I don't think I would have realized the flip side of that coin. I think I needed to see the world through Chuck's eyes before becoming Captain Awesome.
I'm a mean beanbag tosser.
I grew up in Glen Ellyn, which is about 20 miles west of Chicago. I attended Glenbard South High School and University of Illinois. I didn't study acting until I moved to Los Angeles after college, but the fact that I was raised in the Chicago area set the stage for all of my comedic and acting sensibilities.
I'm a huge fan of John Hughes and can say that 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is easily a top 3 favorite. I'm also a huge fan of all the Second City talent, and I think my Dad and Bill Murray are long lost twins.
Thankfully I'm a better actor than football player, or at least I hope so.
