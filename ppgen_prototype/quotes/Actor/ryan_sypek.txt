We're really happy. It still kind of blows my mind that people watch the show!
My apartment complex has a pool. I love it out here. The mountains are beautiful. It's totally different from the place I used to live. I like the heat - the only thing I would change is have the ocean, or a big body of water close by.
I love playing Junior; he's so fun... Under it all, he's a good guy, just a little bit spoiled.
Going to college helped me, because I had four years in the conservatory program, which is close as you can get to a professional environment. It's like all day.
When I was real young I wanted to play baseball. I really loved playing center field, but that was never anything I was really ever that good at. I played up until I was in ninth grade.
