Scottish,Actor
There's something about the silence of people listening to someone or watching someone - I just... I love that.
I was born and brought up in the countryside. I used to live in a sort of converted stables on the grounds of a castle, and I spent a lot of my childhood running around with a pretend sword pretending to be Robert the Bruce.
My accent is... sort of an Edinburgh sort of soft southwest Scottish accent. It could almost be English.
You do have to learn how to wear a kilt, and it's certainly very liberating and very freeing, but surprisingly very comfortable to wear, to ride a horse in a kilt. I was surprised by that.
I was a big 'Battlestar Galactica' fan and 'Star Trek' fan. I grew up watching those.
I'm very lucky. I had a great childhood.
I never once dreamed of sort of being able to be in an American TV series, you know? It was all about theater and touring and sort of being an actor around Scottish theater.
Shakespeare language is fantastic, and to be honest, you don't need to do anything to Shakespeare.
People forget actors can adapt and change their appearance. In this industry, people sometimes cast to type, or as close to type as possible, but actors are a lot more versatile than you think!
I auditioned for 'Game of Thrones' seven times! Loads of times.
I'm obsessed with the moon and space travel, so if I could incorporate that, I'd love to go to space.
Working on 'Outlander' has been a delight, it really has. I had kind of forgotten what Scotland was like, and I'd turned into a bit of a Londoner.
I actually got an initial sense of how big 'Outlander' was going to be on Twitter. We're all on there to help promote the show and also interact with the fans.
