In Hollywood today, it's cool for guys to wear nail polish and earrings in their lips and tongues. I don't get it.
I never planned on being a plumber.
And at the end of the day, if the movie's no good, I'll live to fight another day.
My whole body is a wreck. I've injured myself so many times with jujitsu, skateboarding, football. I guess I like to live hard.
I want to create a little chaos and make people's heads turn.
I've got a little fight in me, but I think that's good.
If you don't have any fight in you, you might as well be dead.
I was raised right. I dig who I am.
I just love women.
To me, theater is the mecca; if you really love to act, that's where it's the most fun, by a long shot.
But with writing, all you need is a pad of paper.
Now my drug is writing or acting, being creative.
I can't sit still for 10 minutes.
Good, bad mediocre or whatever it is, if a director wants me in his movie, I take it as a compliment.
The left side of my brain is telling me I want to sleep with every woman in the world and the other side of my brain is telling me I met this great girl and if I let that go I'm going to regret it.
Now I can't wait to write my next play.
I just feel like if I do good work, then people should respect me for the work I do.
Men should have rough hands and be strong.
I feel I should be doing stupid stuff, but I'm not going to.
I'm never going to get in a fight in public again.
Good things happen when you get your priorities straight.
I was a scam artist in high school for a while.
I had that thing of wanting to prove I was a tough kid.
I was the bad kid in school. I was usually in trouble.
I knew whatever I did, it was going to be big.
I liked being in the spotlight.
