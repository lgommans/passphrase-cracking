French,Actor
I'm like this mercenary actor going from show to show - people love to hire me, but then don't want me around much.
I'd love to do a rom-com. I'd love to be a lover. I'm sure I could be a great lover. I never get to kiss the girl, that's for sure. I just bite them.
I did follow 'Game of Thrones.' I'm incredibly jealous of that cast. I mean, I would have loved to have been on that.
I think that classical theater training is just one aspect of acting. I think that experience of having worked with a lot of text can help you as an actor. It gives you the ability to tackle a larger than life character in parts that require it.
The power of the mind. Basically, being able to control anyone's mind. That would be a very good power.
I never really think things are over. I'm still hoping I'll get a call from 'Supernatural' or 'Vampire Diaries' or 'Fringe' to come back.
Ever wonder why billionaires always need more and more money? It's a power trip.
My dad was fairly well-off, so I was raised in a very comfortable environment: the very nice suburbs of Paris. It was a very idyllic life. I also spent nearly all my summers in Britain, and Christmas, too, because my grandparents lived there.
I was a major Anglophile. My brothers and I were raised knowing both languages, French and English. My dad was born in Austria, educated in Britain, and then went back to France. My mom was born in England, but raised in Egypt and Malaysia. We were a globetrotter family.
New York is the most exhilarating city when you're young. It's a different culture, definitely. I really came to love it.
When my dad hit 40, he quit everything. He sold the house and bought the boat and went off sailing the world. I was on that boat from age 12 to 18. We didn't actually go around the world. We went pretty much from France through the whole Mediterranean basin. We went to Ireland first. We also went to coast of Africa, South America and the Caribbean.
