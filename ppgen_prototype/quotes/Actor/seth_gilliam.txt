I was surprised at the level of commitment that Andrew Lincoln has. The extreme situations that he's asked to perform - that's got to be seriously draining, and he keeps going and going. He's almost not human.
'The Wire' is similar to 'The Walking Dead' in so far as everybody pulling for everybody else to get to the turning point of the story.
It's interesting because a lot of people that stop me on the street now, and they talk about 'The Wire,' and they all have the same question: 'How come they took that show off the air?'
