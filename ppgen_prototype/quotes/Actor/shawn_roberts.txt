It's always nice to be able to show your friends and family what it is that you do. I've had their support from the beginning and wouldn't be here without it, so yeah, I do whatever I can to be there with them when they go to see it.
I've worked with people at different stages of their careers and different success levels, and one thing I've noticed about the guys at the top is they're so relaxed and calm - it's about not having anything to prove except doing good work.
I was 12 years old, so auditioning for a TV show was something I didn't even think really happened. The next thing you know, I ended up booking the gig and I did four seasons on 'Emily of New Moon.' I got to learn on the job and kept going from there.
