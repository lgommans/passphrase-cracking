Innately, there are qualities in human beings that are always repetitive. There are things like love and hate and jealousy that are just going to be there forever.
I read an interview with Mark Wahlberg, and he was like, 'I might read a script and love it, but it's all about the filmmaker.' I think that's a good lesson for me.
What I've realised is that when I walk into a club, I don't feel good, I feel uncomfortable. I wonder what to do, I look for my drink... it's not necessarily an enjoyable experience, so why would I put myself through that?
My favorite movie of all time is probably 'The Thing Called Love.' It's a formulaic film but it's got River Phoenix, who is like a god to me. I could watch that once a week.
When I went to college, I was doing well in school, but I didn't have any drive to study.
I think writing is such a great talent, and if I was better, I would love to be a writer.
People make up rumors and put them on the Internet.
I try to create as many circumstances outside of set that help me fall into character when I get onto set.
I'm a calm person who wants to talk about things and think things through.
