American,Actor
When I went to school - Pasadena Playhouse - we were taught that the obligation of the actor is twofold: to entertain and to educate.
If you're not passionate about what you want to do, you won't be good at it.
Was I a successful father? Maybe not. Was I a successful husband? Probably not. Was I a successful actor? Probably not.
My career as an actor started when I was six years old, taking dancing lessons. Then I started getting paid jobs to dance at the age of seven.
Every film that I have done has a special place in my heart.
I have actually directed over thirty plays and about one hundred commercials for cable TV, but have not yet had the opportunity to direct a feature film.
'Lawrence of Arabia' is a film that anyone wanting to become an actor should watch at least six hundred times.
