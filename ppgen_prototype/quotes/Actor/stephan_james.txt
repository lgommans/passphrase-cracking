I've had some experience in track and field in school, but I did have to train to be able to play Jesse Owens - to be a runner, to be an Olympian.
While shooting 'Selma,' I would train on my off time with the assistant men's track and field coach at Georgia Tech.
When I first got the call from my manager asking if I'd ever heard of Jesse Owens, I recognized the name, looked him up, and was blown away by his story.
Growing up, I was always into sports - basketball and volleyball - but I wasn't really a runner.
