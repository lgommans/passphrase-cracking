Vampires to me have always been very sexy.
Basically, at some point, one day maybe you can expect to hear some of my music. I haven't really done that yet because my younger brother is a musician and really talented and I want him to come out with his music first.
But, I didn't get my first break until I was 17.
I don't want to just be in the normal kind of teen movie.
I guess what I learned the most was to feel lucky with what I have been able to accomplish and what I have and to feel humble about the people I have been able to work with.
I liked getting the best villain award. I thought that was funny.
I play guitar and I love the Beatles and melodic music.
I started acting before that when I was about 13 or 14.
I think acting is only one part of the piece of the movie. I'ts an important piece, but I'd like to be involved in all the other aspects of making movies.
I wouldn't want to do a whole movie with effects.
I've mainly been in dramas, so this is one of my first comedy kind of performances in Cecil B. Demented.
I've read some scripts, but I don't read as many books as I should.
It used to be you did TV or you did film. Now it's like a media blitz.
Nuclear arms is pretty scary because that could end the world. I'm more interested in that stuff than I am Bill Clinton. I mean, I think Bill Clinton is a good president.
That's the danger of having too much success. You lose that magic, that feeling of not being in control, which I feel now, it's too controlled.
They're trying to beat out this movie, the Ring, which is a similar idea. Our movie is about a website you visit and die in three days. Their movie is about a videotape you watch - and die in three days.
Yes, I definitely plan to direct at some point.
You have to feel the bad to be able to feel the good.
