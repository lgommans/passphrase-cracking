You do a lead in a series, you're kind of in a bubble of self-containment and almost not really present in the world at all. You're really a brand more than a human being.
As a kid, I always wanted to be an explorer, to go to exotic places and do exotic things.
People who work in diamonds and in oil wreck a lot of the Earth and a lot of the people on it.
I'm not sure I like making movies that my kids can't go to, but that's just how it is.
