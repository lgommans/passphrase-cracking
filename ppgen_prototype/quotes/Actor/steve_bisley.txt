Australian,Actor
I think if you hold your nerve and don't sell out and become something that you're not, you can go anywhere. You know, I think that sort of heart and honesty and size travels.
I am a great observer of things, and I do it all the time. I store stuff; I use it as an actor; that sort of recall, of emotional memory and images of things, just tastes of things.
As an actor, the thing I want to do to an audience is always be ahead of them and always be surprising in the work without deviating from the writer's intention.
Writing a novel is easier than writing a memoir; you are not constrained by the truth.
I've got a good memory. Sometimes it's a curse. I remember what the light was like in the room the first time I heard Van Morrison's 'Moondance.'
