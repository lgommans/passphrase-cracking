American,Actor
I'm not sure that acting is something for a grown man to be doing.
I would rather wake up in the middle of nowhere than in any city on earth.
I'm not a great actor - let's face it. I don't have a great deal of scope. There are certain things I can do, but when I'm bad, I stink. There's something about my shaggy dog eyes that makes people think I'm good. I'm not all that good.
When I did 'The Great Escape,' I kept thinking, 'If they were making a movie of my life, that's what they'd call it - the great escape.'
