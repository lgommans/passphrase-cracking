That's such a great thing about New York, after growing up in a place and being there for twenty plus years, there's still a whole island to discover.
I love how you can shoot a movie in a month or two or three of four, and it's this encapsulated story that you box up and ship out into the world, and what it is, is what it is.
What's fun for me is to try new things and push myself and not get stuck in one genre or another, or stuck with one character or another.
I grew up in New York, in the Village, and I started going to Stella Adler pretty young. I was 13 or 14 years old. But I was also really shy when I was growing up.
With '10,000,' our aim was to make a film that was entertaining and a roller-coaster ride; it is what it is. It's an adventure film.
I've been incredibly fortunate to be able to have different opportunities and be able to choose, which is kind of amazing.
