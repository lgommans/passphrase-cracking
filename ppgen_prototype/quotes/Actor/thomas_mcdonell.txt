When I was in high school, I wasn't a troublemaker. I didn't get in fights. I was a good student and I had a lot of friends.
The truth is, I don't really have a type of girl.
Well, it's really important to be honest with the person that you're seeing.
I mean, I like nice girls, and I like people who are generous.
I think there are certain technical things about acting that change between working in film and television. Everything definitely slows down and we have more time in film.
I went to a school in N.Y. that is conceptual and interdisciplinary and modeled after Cal Arts. It is not just painting or sculpture; it was everything mixed together.
I wasn't into acting when I was a kid. Maybe because I was shy or it didn't occur to me.
