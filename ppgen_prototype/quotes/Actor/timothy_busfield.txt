American,Actor
I'm a jerk, first and foremost. I don't know the answers. I'm an idiot. I make mistakes. I stick my foot in my mouth. I'm insensitive when I don't want to be.
I'm not a fan of living in L.A. when I'm not working there.
Being cool is not exactly at the top of my list.
I was a pitcher, played third base, shortstop. I was good at all the positions and great at none. All it takes is a .111 lifetime batting average to make you go into acting.
Understand that I had no concept of what being an actor was like when I was a kid - but I wanted to be an actor. Dressing up and being other people seemed like so much fun, but I didn't know what was involved.
I've got an affinity and love for old theaters.
When I was 30, I was very popular. Kids would scream, and women would scream.
I was born in '57, so during the winters when I was growing up, we were ice skating in people's yards, and school got cancelled sometimes for snow days - I have these good memories.
Poindexter was a part that's in the children's theater side of me, that character actor side of me. It's probably my favorite role because nobody will let me play that anymore.
Any time you work for Aaron Sorkin, your life as an actor is drastically improved.
'Studio 60' was a magical experience, as I directed six episodes, was a series regular and a producer... Dream job.
