American,Actor
Having my son made me grow up. I'm keeping my dangers in the movies.
That's what's great about baseball: some people are exceptional at the game, but still, even people that aren't very athletic, like me - I played Little League! It's one of those games in sports where even if you're not the greatest, you can still play.
If you don't get famous when you're a kid, it makes the transition to adult actor easier.
I've come to learn that you can be very, very talented, but if you're not at the right place at the right time... It's a lot of luck.
I work in a hospital as a patient transporter to make ends meet for my three kids.
