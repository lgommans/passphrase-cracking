I got my high school diploma and a degree from the University of California. But most important, I got myself together and found out who I was and how I could proceed without destroying myself.
If I hadn't been a fighter, I probably wouldn't have gotten the 'Rocky' roles.
If I hadn't been in prison, maybe I wouldn't have gotten all those prison roles.
It took a while, but your life prepares you for these roles.
