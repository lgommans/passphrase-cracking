Scottish,Actor
I play a character called Lieutenant Delcourt who, in the original comics, pops up from time to time to rescue Tintin. I guess if you've grown up watching movies like 'Jaws' and 'Indiana Jones,' it's pretty surreal to find yourself on set with Steven Spielberg directing you.
The studio are making a lot of good noises about 'Bunker Hill;' so it would be great if that goes ahead. We had a riot filming it.
There was an act of defiance which goes on where these humans and aliens save these children, and hence the name/term of 'Defiance.' Formerly, it was St. Louis. This frontier town springs up from it. And everybody tries to integrate, they try to re-invent themselves as well.
The town formerly known as St. Louis is now 'Defiance.' The scope of the show and game is going to be massive because you have the people who love the genre of gaming who love sci-fi; they're in bed together, normally.
You have the wookie character, which is one of the biggest aliens in 'Defiance.' These guys are just walking about with these mechanical faces on, and it actually looks insane. The amount of diversity of all the aliens in the town is quite unbelievable.
I have been very fortunate to be able to work and get the opportunity to play different roles. It's nice to do big studio pictures and then work in Glasgow on films like 'Red Road' and then dress up as a vampire or an alien. I think that's why a lot of people are actors - the versatility.
I've been lucky. I don't for a minute take for granted the good fortune I have had. You don't like to get ideas above your station, especially a boy from the south side of Glasgow.
I miss family and friends, and I'd like to get back to work more in Scotland, and do more things like theatre and 'Red Road.' But over here you have the beach and the mountains and the climate. A lot of people diss L.A. as being all tinsel town, fake this and fake that, but a place is only as good as the people you know.
