Australian,Actor
I'm on the path to being someone I'm equally terrified by and obsessed with. My true self.
I feel like part of getting better at writing is knowing where to find that inspiration. Right after something happens to me, the first thing I'll do is go write when those feelings are really, really fresh.
People think I must have pushy parents, but that's not the case.
I share every aspect of my life with the Internet. Whether or not that's a good thing, I don't know.
I've definitely always had a passion for entertaining.
When I was born, I always knew something was a little bit different about me.
Right after something happens to me, the first thing I'll do is go write when those feelings are really, really fresh. I'll hum a tune into my phone sometimes.
I feel like I have just been really, really lucky to meet some of the most successful and great actors alive today.
I think that the beauty of 'Spud' is that everyone can connect to the character of Spud in so many ways. It's about real experiences that happen to kids all the time.
I wanted to write a song about war and that classic 'We want you' recruitment style from the point of view of the recruiter.
I think pop music is in such an exciting place right now, and I do kind of credit that to Lorde with 'Royals.' I think that song changed everything in the pop scene. All of the sudden, alternative pop music became pop music.
I have a majority girl audience on YouTube.
I watched pretty much every coming out video on YouTube that has ever been posted; I watched it in between 14 and a half and 15. Those coming out videos, and those people on YouTube, those brave, brave, brave people on YouTube, without them, I don't know where I'd be.
