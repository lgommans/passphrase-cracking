American,Actor
I played baseball my entire life, up through college and everything, so working out and being physically active was always a huge part of my life. I'll spend at least a couple of hours in the gym a day.
If I'm in the gym I'll stay for a while, and I'm not usually in a hurry to leave.
For me, as an actor, one of the biggest fears on a TV show is getting stuck in something where you end up feeling like you're doing the same thing, every single year.
My girlfriend and I never let each other forget how much we love each other. It's all about reminding the other person how important and special she is to you.
I'm a mama's boy.
I love going to movies by myself.
