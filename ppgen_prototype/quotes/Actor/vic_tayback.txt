American,Actor
My character at 'Mel's diner' was involved in betting on the horses and all that.
If I walked into a restaurant, the other diners would look around and say, 'I hope you're not cooking.'
I tell young actors to do anything that will sustain them.
Too many actors get on an ego trip and won't do commercials, so they sit around for 20 years between jobs.
