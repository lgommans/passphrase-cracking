Indian,Actor
I wanted to get into films, and my parents were against it. I convinced my mom, and finally she convinced my dad. My dad then felt, who best to launch his son than him? So he launched me, and here I am.
I am like a friend to my kids. My wife, Sangeeta, handles their studies, etc.
I liked Michael Jackson and used to practice his steps. I enjoy dancing!
