Chinese,Actor
The relationship between East and West needs to be and can be fixed via pop culture.
I write and do all my arrangements on my Mac. And um, I use Logic Pro, which is a great software program.
The 'chinked out' style is a school of hip hop - that's the way I like to think of it - that incorporates Chinese elements and sounds.
I've never really had the urge to make an English album.
I've just had a wonderful time doing Chinese music, and it's been so rewarding for me. I feel like there's so much potential in mandarin music, and there's so much, you know, ground left to be broken.
I studied classical opera, so I was always singing in Italian and German and French.
