A reflection of an exact image is the closest thing to you-so that you can see it-but it's far enough away so that you really understand it. There is real life in this movie, but it hovers just an inch above reality.
You treat characters like people you meet in life-friends or mentors.
Both my parents are Methodist preachers, I grew up in a church.
Then my extended family, there are preachers and evangelists, former priests. So I have quite a bit of history with Church, religion and spirituality.
I still consider myself a very spiritual person but the structure of the church isn't really for me.
I didn't know anything about Opus Die except from pop culture, like Dan Brown novels, which I knew wasn't really knowing anything about Opus Die.
But as a kid, I loved 'Monty Python.' My Dad was a devout watcher. We used to watch it when we ate dinner!
After 'Four Feathers,' I quit then because I just lost faith. I didn't like how the business was.
I wanted fame, but I thought it would be incremental, and I became afraid of the overnight-sensation thing.
