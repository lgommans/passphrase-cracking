I'm ready to deal with somebody else's baggage. I'm sick of mine.
If I had a job pitching for the Giants, I probably wouldn't be manning my own Twitter account.
My pitching in 'Dazed and Confused' was so bad that they had to use cut-ins with a stunt double, and I spent most of that filming night being ruthlessly mocked by a team of Little League extras.
