American,Actor
A career in film didn't seem like something I could attain. Whereas I grew up next to New York City, and I spent my life going into New York City seeing plays, and I was a theater actor in school. Acting on the stage felt really natural to me, and I liked it, and I wasn't terrible at it.
I knew I'd never have the career Colin Farrell had. I was working in stuff that was, for me, not very challenging. My career wasn't going as well as I wanted it to. So I turned to writing because I felt like I had more to say, and I started writing every day.
Instead of waiting around for someone to give you a job, you have to go and create work for yourself. It took me a while to figure that out for myself.
All love stories rest on the leads, and if they work, the show works, and if they don't, the show won't work, no matter how good the writing is.
I'm friends with most of my exes because I'm sort of proud of my ex list. I've dated some really great girls.
It's really intense to write and make a movie and produce it and have it come out in the world. It's a very vulnerable thing.
There's more pressure as a writer. As an actor you usually just go, do your job, and go home.
