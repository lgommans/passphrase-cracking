American,Actor
I started volunteering at an animal shelter, and little by little, my life started getting better. I think that is the secret. It is just being on a mission that is something bigger than me and it's thankless. You do that because it is thankless, and I am not looking for anybody to say, 'Thanks' and 'You are great!'
Everything I do is to support my passion, and that is the rescuing of animals!
If you are passionate only about yourself -that is the road to disaster.
You have to be passionate about something other than yourself!
I knew I would be an actor since I was seven or eight.
