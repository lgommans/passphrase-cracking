American,Actor
When I first came to this country, I didn't know how to speak English.
Honestly, I've been very blessed. Yes, I am cursed with this gift.
The sex with Mandy was good, but it wasn't like warm apple pie.
Mandy because that was the most meaningful relationship.
I play opposite Beverly D'Angelo, and that was definitely a great time.
I got hit twice in the face, and that was not fun.
As an actor, you should be willing to take challenges.
Because I had an accent, people had this impression that I was dumb.
