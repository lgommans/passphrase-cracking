I'd better make hay while the sun shines.
It's exciting that you've got an entire season to experience 24 hours of highly dramatically charged human experience. It allows for the close inspection of minutiae in behaviour.
I want to direct films, because I am a painter and a sculptor and I've done a lot of writing.
I don't look too far ahead.
I can't help but have my sights set on Scorsese, Cohen Brothers and Spike Jones.
Directing is the ultimate way to bring together all the art forms I've been involved with over the years.
