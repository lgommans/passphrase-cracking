Girls have an unfair advantage over men: if they can't get what they want by being smart, they can get it by being dumb.
When I am dead and buried, on my tombstone I would like to have it written, 'I have arrived.' Because when you feel that you have arrived, you are dead.
I am just a nice, clean-cut Mongolian boy.
Because when you feel that you have arrived, you are dead.
I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Now that I'm gone, I tell you, don't smoke.
