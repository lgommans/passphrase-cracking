I'm not a wimpy kid at all. I don't care what other people think - I only care what I think about myself.
When I was about four, people used to walk up to my mom and say I should be in commercials.
I love retweeting things and seeing how many fans are on other people's pages.
Zach Galifianakis is hilarious. I worked with him on a pilot before; he's hilarious and such a nice person.
I've always wanted to go to Australia. I hear it's a great place. I mean, kangaroos are pretty awesome. That's an up factor.
