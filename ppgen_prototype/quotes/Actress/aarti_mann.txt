American,Actress
I'm the daughter of two Indian immigrant doctors, and I have an older sister and younger brother, and none of us have pursued medicine as a career. We're all over the artistic side of things.
My mom always knew I was going to be an actor because I was a ham from the very beginning, so she would push me toward it, which is really unconventional for Indian families to do.
I'd really love to get back into commercials, actually. I love how quick and breezy they are. And honestly, they pay really well.
Every sitcom needs their straight man or straight woman.
