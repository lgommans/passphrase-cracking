American,Actress
I can access emotions very easily.
I'd like to make really important movies, like American Beauty. I was really proud to be a part of that movie.
An agent said he didn't know what to do with me, I wouldn't be able to play any parts but lesbians and aliens.
If I could stomach the awful part of being a veterinarian, which involves sticking your hand up animals' behinds, I would be a vet.
One out of forty American men wears women's clothing. We've had more than forty presidents. One of these guys has been dancing around the Oval Office in a prom dress.
I'm afraid of flying.
I can tell when men are threatened by my height.
Everyone couldn't be happier and more terrified.
Most Republicans call the show 'The Left Wing.'
I like people trying to do two things at once.
It is a very difficult job, being the servant of two masters.
It's a great way to start the day, hearing you've been nominated for an Emmy. It's just thrilling.
Great drama is all about conflict, and what's a better conflict than Republican-Democrat?
I have the power of my height. Growing up, it was a total drawback. There was nothing good about it at all.
I grew up with brothers. I love men. Of course it's hard to be a woman in a man's world.
I am lucky enough to have Aaron Sorkin write what I have to say.
Someone said I wasn't attractive enough. People say those things, but they make you stronger. Then you can win an Emmy and think, ha, ha, ha.
