I do mostly comedy, and it tends to be a subtler comedy. But I think that probably lends itself well to commercials.
For the longest time, I was auditioning, getting called back, and I had a long string of things not going my way. I thought, 'Maybe this is never going happen. Maybe I'll never book a commercial.'
Casting directors don't necessarily want a more recognizable commercial face. Sometimes, they want a lesser known person.
I love Kristin Wigg. I love Amy Poelher.
