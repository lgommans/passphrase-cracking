I don't regret any decision in my life... not my career, not marriage. Every experience has been so fulfilling in so many ways.
I'd just love to ride off into the sunset with my love. I've only seen the sunset so far. Maybe I can earn my own Ferrari so I can ride off in the sunset without anyone by my side.
My daughter was never offered 'Student Of The Year 2.'
Today's kids have a mind of their own, and they know how to exercise it. Even if I wanted to tell Sara or my son Ibrahim how to lead their lives - which I don't - they would not listen to me. Luckily, Sara chose to complete her studies before pursuing acting. She attended Columbia University and then devoted her attention to Bollywood.
I do not know how anyone can mould anyone.
Like everybody, I too believed that couples lived happily ever after. But it only happens in books.
The best thing about my marriage are my two kids.
If my children want to pursue their dreams, I will always support them.
I have a bad memory - thank God for that!
My kids and I live like three fun-loving hermits. We're quite bohemian.
I need to work to support myself and my kids. No one pays for my support.
