American,Actress
My mom taught me to go after my dreams. I have this faith in myself that I must have gotten from her.
I believe I can do anything. If I decide I want to be a doctor tomorrow, I'm going to be a doctor.
I can't imagine actually singing on this show like I did on 'Felicity', but it would be kind of funny.
I just kind of change, constantly, what my focus is. So whatever is stimulating me or inspiring me at the time is what I focus on.
Right now the music is more of a hobby since I'm making a good living as an actress.
