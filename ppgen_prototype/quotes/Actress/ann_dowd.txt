It's a question of dropping the armor and getting up and doing the work you want to do. And film at first is frightening because you are like, 'What's that camera doing?' But then it becomes family and therefore a really wonderful experience.
I have to say my background was mostly theatre, which I love, and it took a long time to feel comfortable there. That's probably true of anyone's career.
TV is terrific. It's really fast paced which I find difficult.
Life gets more interesting as it goes on. It becomes fuller because there is perspective there.
I think women are used to stepping up and getting the job done when you need to.
