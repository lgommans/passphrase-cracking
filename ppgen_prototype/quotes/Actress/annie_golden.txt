I am the flower child who will not wilt. You couldn't have asked for anything more.
If you are a singer and you lose your voice, you realize that you have other skill sets when that is taken out of the equation.
People come up to me all the time. If I'm with friends or in a crowd, I'm fine, but if I'm by myself, I get afraid because people are nuts.
All of my friends in the business ask, 'Why is this woman not a star? Why is she not a household name?'
I was the illegitimate child of the legitimate theater. I had no training. I came from downtown rock and roll, and when I came in and auditioned for the Broadway revival of 'Hair,' I had no eyebrows - kind of a Bowie-esque glimmer kid. And it was hard representing the flower power era when we were stone cold punks.
If I wrote a memoir, it would be like 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.'
Every time you're given a job, you're given a gift, and if you're flexible, you never know what's going to happen.
