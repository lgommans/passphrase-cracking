American,Actress
I wanted to be a ballerina so badly. You can be seen and take over the spotlight without speaking. I had a fear of speaking in public back then.
I just discovered the Santa Monica flea market, every Sunday. I go weekly. There's a lot of interesting things there.
If you're going to school, you should do what you enjoy.
I think Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen have a lot of chemistry between them.
This is my breakfast: Two poached eggs, turkey bacon, and a half avocado. The yolks in a poached egg are alkalizing. Avocados are a great source of fat and vitamin E; great for your skin. It's super light and not too heavy. Sometimes I like a little sweet as well, so I have a cup of plain yogurt with blueberries.
I got to work with Jennifer Tilly, she was amazing. Such, such a smart actress.
