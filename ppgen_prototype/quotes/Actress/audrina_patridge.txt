I don't even think twice about wearing a swimsuit because it's always been a part of my lifestyle.
I have always been into music. That's my number one passion.
A lot of the guys that I date and my friends are all in bands.
I love everything, but I really love rock music. Incubus, Augustana, Nirvana, Chevelle, iHi-Hi-Fi, they're my really good friends.
Everyone in the music industry is so fun and laid-back.
I definitely feel much more comfortable in front of the cameras after 'The Hills.' Before, it was much more nerve-racking.
At the beginning of 'The Hills,' I couldn't watch myself because I'm very critical and would pick myself to pieces. But with movies I feel like it's different because you're playing a character. So it's like watching yourself but not watching yourself.
I knew how to swim by the time I turned 4.
I have olive skin, so if I'm in the sun for even 15 minutes, I turn brown.
I try to get to the beach every day. It brings sanity to my life. I'll just sit and read a book and enjoy the quiet.
