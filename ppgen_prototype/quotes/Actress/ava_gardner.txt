American,Actress
Because I was promoted as a sort of a siren and played all those sexy broads, people made the mistake of thinking I was like that off the screen. They couldn't have been more wrong.
What's the point? My face, shall we say, looks lived in.
Deep down, I'm pretty superficial.
I think the main reason my marriages failed is that I always loved too well but never wisely.
I have only one rule in acting - trust the director and give him heart and soul.
I suffered, I really suffered, with all three of my husbands. And I tried damn hard with all three, starting each marriage certain that it was going to last until the end of my life. Yet none of them lasted more than a year or two.
