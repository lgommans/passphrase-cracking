What you learn in any acting class is how to make a fool of yourself and enjoy things and get out of your head.
In school I really loved Shakespeare, and I participated in a country-wide Shakespeare competition.
I didn't have that typical high school experience of feeling ashamed of who I was. I once wore a superman cape and pajamas, and I thought that was awesome - and some people didn't! But some people did, and it was an arts high school, so nobody made me feel bad about who I was.
I feel like everything will be a letdown after 'You're The Worst.' It was such a great experience.
