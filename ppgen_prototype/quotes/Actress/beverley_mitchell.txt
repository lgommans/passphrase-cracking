I think the hardest part about being a teenager is dealing with other teenagers - the criticism and the ridicule, the gossip and rumors.
My best friend and I love to make fish faces.
Part of growing up is just taking what you learn from that and moving on and not taking it to heart.
Nowadays, I could not care less about making other people like me. I'm a good person, I don't need to do that anymore.
I think it's so important to keep learning and keep your brain active.
Still, it's tough trying to combine my acting career with my college career.
If I had to give one piece of advice to incoming college freshmen, I'd say always be true to yourself.
I was in New York and I walked into this pet store and came out with a dog.
Mostly, nothing's really changed. I'm still the dorky nerd that I always was.
In real life, one of my friends was killed in a car accident during our sophomore year.
I started working on a line of clothes last year, but right now we're kind of at a standstill.
I was never really obsessed with the whole guy thing to begin with.
Actually, the kids at school don't treat me any differently at all just because I'm on television.
Even though college has been hard, I don't want to give up.
