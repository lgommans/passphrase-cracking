I can't change the world. I have to fix me.
Everybody grows up.
In my old age I've come to find that if you respect other people, you feel better about yourself.
You never really want anything you can easily have.
I'd always been treated like an object, not like a human.
I've made this decision not to talk to the press about anything that's gone on in my life, but just to write music about it. They can interpret it themselves.
Music is real; it's something you can touch and feel.
Music makes your soul feel amazing while you're performing it.
The fact of the matter is I'm 21 now. I stay home. I feed my dogs. I don't really go out. I work.
My dad was a great dad.
