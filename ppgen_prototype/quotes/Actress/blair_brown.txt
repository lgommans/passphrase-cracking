American,Actress
I've always read a lot of sci-fi. When my son was younger, I actually went to a 'Star Trek' convention.
I like sci-fi that is not entirely impossible.
I'm less of a 'Star Wars' fan, with googley monsters, than actually how do we bend this reality out, and how many other realities exist?
I know all actors are different, but I've never sat down and asked the writers, 'Where are we headed? Am I good or bad?'
