When I was 14, I came very close to becoming a gay teen suicide 'statistic,' but I then turned to music, my piano, my loved ones, and discovered that it does in fact get better.
I'm not hiding who I am anymore - not pretending I'm something I'm not.
In the male homosexual community, we love to label and categorize and organize each other as if we are in a never-ending high school biology class.
It's not particularly fun to have to factor in step stools to almost all areas of your home.
I'm the 'Scandal'-'Nashville' kind of TV watcher.
I think that Mama June has the greatest self-esteem on the planet. I always say to people, 'If I had her self-worth, I would probably be ruling the world.'
I have been working professionally in the entertainment industry since I was six.
I definitely still have my hand in acting. I don't think I would be able to walk away from it. It's my passion.
