All eyes are on you when you're modeling and acting, and I just didn't want the attention when I wasn't working. But as I've gotten older, I've become more comfortable with my body and am taking more fashion risks.
I've always had a tomboy look.
I used to always buy clothes too big, but I should have showed off instead of covering up.
I didn't fall into the category of the 'classic Bond girl.' I had short hair - and no Bond girl before me ever had. They put me in a wig at the beginning of the film, and then had my character cut her hair to pretend to be someone else. That was to explain why my hair was short.
Hey, once a Bond girl, always a Bond girl. It will always be a big deal - it's an exclusive club.
