American,Actress
I make my relationships at work.
An actor really suffers when the director isn't prepared because you start running out of time for the shoot and then have to do it fast.
It's hard to regulate the speed at which you can achieve something creative and emotional.
Acting is pretty much my whole life.
I don't feel that I have any great grasp of technique that I should pass along to people.
It's very hard to remain a student in life.
That's when the great stuff happens, when you're not checking yourself all the time, being critical of yourself and what other people are doing.
People who are interested in the arts and theater are such a minority.
And my first film was Carnal Knowledge, another amazing experience, largely because of Mike Nichols, who would tell me you can't do anything wrong because you're doing everything right.
I don't put together cars, I put together people.
I know I'll work, but not when or where. I never know what to pack.
The Oscar nomination made me a recognizable name to other actors and people in general.
I don't like that I'm my own commodity, that I am what I sell.
Work is the most nourishing thing so far in my life.
I have fun at work.
My face is my career.
I only eat things that you don't have to kill.
