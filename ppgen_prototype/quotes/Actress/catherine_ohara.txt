Night time really is the best time to work. All the ideas are there to be yours because everyone is asleep.
I think the success of my work stems from being truthful.
I know. I'm lazy. But I made myself a New Years resolution that I would write myself something really special. Which means I have 'til December, right?
Character roles definitely age better than your ingenues. You don't get to keep doing that.
I lived in L.A. for a few months. It seemed like no one there had parents. Or if they did have parents, they would deny it.
I'm pretty much a good Catholic girl at heart and I believe in family. I also have a basic belief that God takes care of me. I believe in prayer, even though I'm not that religious. I just have that foundation from my family. I mean when you think that you're just a human being and one of God's creatures, you can't take anything that seriously.
To this day, I've found that it doesn't matter what a guy looks like if he's really funny. His sense of humor makes him attractive. On the other hand, you don't hear men saying, 'No she's not pretty, but is she ever funny!'
You've got muscles and you use them everywhere else in your body when you want it. Why not your face?
I mean, I knew I wanted to do this kind of thing in school, but to actually have somebody that would bring you into that world, that was really exciting, you know?
I wouldn't mind spending a little more time and effort and money on good skin care. And I'm sure they'll come out with, as they are doing, with more and more treatments that are noninvasive and healthy ways to keep your face looking as good as it can.
I'm afraid of needles, except acupuncture needles.
