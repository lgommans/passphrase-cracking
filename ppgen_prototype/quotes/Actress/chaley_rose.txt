When I watch myself on TV, it's impossible not to say, 'Is that really what my neck looks like?'
I'm not hard on myself - I brush those things off - but there are days when I'm pleased with myself, and days when I think I have elf ears.
When I was younger, all I wanted to do was be a singer, and then I got into a great acting class in New York and became obsessed with that.
