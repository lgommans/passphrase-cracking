When I was five years old, I told my parents that I wanted to take ballet. So, ballet was the focus of my life... until puberty. Then I discovered boys and started dating a guy with a mohawk who'd come to my ballet class and freak everybody out. Shortly after that is when I quit.
My death scene in 'The Salton Sea' is really weird. I mean, I get shot in the head. What experience can you possibly draw from? There's nothing you can compare it to, really.
I would love to do a play, but I don't know about musical theatre. I've never done anything like that.
I think to describe 'The Gates' as a genre show is tricky because when you think of what's a vampire show or what's a supernatural kind of thing, I think other shows... maybe focus on that element probably slightly more than our show does.
