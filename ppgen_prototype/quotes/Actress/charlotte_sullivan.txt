UNICEF is such a special organization, and to spread the word just makes me so happy.
Since I was a kid, I've had this morbid fascination with dark and scary subject matter.
I was obsessed with David Bowie - still am. He's a babe, a total babe. His music is killer; his visuals are beautiful.
I'm completely gobsmacked by the 'Rookie Blue' fans.
