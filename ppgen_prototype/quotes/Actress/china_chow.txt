I don't even like hearing my own voice on an answering machine.
I used to be more glamorous.
I buy some art but I don't like to talk about it.
I'm so private and I don't know why!
Better not to work on things that you're not in love with.
If I don't work for a while, I don't work for a while.
I don't want to do television. A TV show sitcom? I don't even watch TV.
The only times I'm consistent about praying are when I'm on an airplane or when an ambulance goes by.
The art world seems so much bigger than it was when I was growing up.
I feel like contemporary art is everywhere now and with the rise of the internet, it's so much easier to see what artists are doing and to follow their careers.
Making art is different for everyone.
