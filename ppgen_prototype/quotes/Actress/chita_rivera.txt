Puerto Rican,Actress
It's communication - that's what theatre is all about.
I can tell you where my Tonys are. They're in a beautiful place in my living room, in a glass cabinet.
Beauty is not everything!
We're going to Puerto Rico, where we're gonna close. And we're so excited, we can't see straight.
After about 15 minutes, you feel that you're winning them over.
I have been very lucky, I have only had one bad experience.
I have to make this love affair believable enough. It's very European.
I was busy welcoming a new experience. I had never done a movie before.
I'd like to get the word out there, the word has to be spread.
I'm an old-fashioned girl.
I'm not comfortable with just me, me, me. That's boring.
I've played American, Italian, Greek, French. I've been really lucky that way.
My hairdresser and I found ourselves shopping at Bloomingdale's with nothing to do for days.
San Francisco has just blown us all away. I also understand Angels in America didn't do well there.
Somebody told me once I wasn't Latin enough, and that made me laugh.
Southern California, they have been amazing. They're totally with us.
The show did go on, but came very close to not going on at all.
Theatre is immediate gratification.
You can feel whether an audience is tightened up and pulled back. Of course the opposite is an audience like we've been having in LA, which is fabulous.
You take a plug and put it in a socket, and that's what the theatre is-it lights up right away. You speak, and they respond immediately.
