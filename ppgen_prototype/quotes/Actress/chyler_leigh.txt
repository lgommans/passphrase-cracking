American,Actress
I don't like to do much with my hair - which is good, because I don't know how! I just always make sure I have a great haircut.
It is important to find worth in yourself.
I'm always down to do a sitcom. I did 'That '80s Show' back in the day and that was a really great experience.
At the risk of sounding too cliche, I found a really fantastic church. That is what keeps me grounded.
Yes, I do strive to be someone young women can look up to.
I have exercise-induced asthma.
When it comes to skin care, I like to keep things simple. I'm not the type of person who runs out to have facials.
I'm always worried that lipstick is on my teeth or caked in the corners of my mouth.
