American,Actress
I'm not the type of artist that's like, 'Let's go out and party and dance your life away!' I think those artists are so cool, but I wanted meaning in my songs and they have messages.
I'm a very message-oriented artist, and each song has a totally different meaning.
I know if I wasn't making music and acting, I would be involved in the performing arts world in some way. I would be either writing and making music for other artists or producing movies.
I always joke around with my parents and say that if Hollywood doesn't work out I'll go to Broadway!
I absolutely love talking to all of my fans.
I am so excited to perform; I am so ready to perform; I love live performances! I think it's something so different from a track; live is just so unique and cool because the energy is just so different. I cannot wait to have live performances.
