I try to keep an open mind but I'm so tired of the mediocrity.
Because of the high altitude, you get drunk really fast. So everyone's drunk all the time.
I don't like anything new.
I like horror movies, they're fun. It was the most fun I've had on a movie set.
I love Les Beaux Peeps. Everyone in that band works together really well. I used to go out to see bands a lot; now it seems there just aren't any I like.
I talk too quiet, and I have to yell on stage.
I was a loner in high school. I keep to myself, but I love life.
I'm a lot more grounded now, a lot more settled in my skin.
I've gotten better at not making people feel uncomfortable with my shyness.
It takes 300 years, it seems, for the great bands to get their due.
It was strange at times. We had to make out so much that we kind of got over it. It was really awkward.
It's hard to be scared when there are 80 people around you.
My senior year I was basically supporting myself, so it was like, Do you want to eat and pay the rent, or do you want to go to school? I wanted to eat and pay the rent.
Teachers didn't like me very much. They thought I was just this punk kid and they always wanted to kick me out.
