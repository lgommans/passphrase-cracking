Getting buried alive will always be my claim to fame.
Danny and I worked really hard in the beginning of the relationship to find different levels of this couple.
The thing that I like about the way characters are written on the show these days is that nobody's perfect. Everyone has made a lot of mistakes and bad choices.
They've never written a love story for me since I've been on the show and I think there's just more weight to it when two people love each other.
I've been on the show for six years and I don't even know what her history is. I sort of make things up in my mind, but I think it's hard for an audience to follow and invest in a character when they don't have the details.
My understanding is that Olivia had no idea what was going on.
I think we're in good hands. There's definitely much more momentum in bringing in good things to help support the show. Everyone's got a good attitude about it and I think that makes all the difference.
