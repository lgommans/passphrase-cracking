I've lived on my own since I was 18, and I really love living alone. That, to me, is just great.
I think the human mind is fascinating. I love figuring out why people are doing what they do.
I love the freedom of having my own space and my own place and doing things on my terms, and not really having to think about anybody else's schedule.
When you first get out of doing a show for a long time where you played a teenager, casting directors and producers all still look at you as being the character that you played for so long.
I'm huge into '90s rap. It's my jam.
I went to college parties when I was at an appropriate age to go to college parties.
Some of my favorite memories happened in the 'Boy Meets World' classroom.
When you spend seven years of your life working on something that you're really passionate about, and other people end up loving it, too, that just makes all of the work worthwhile.
I wasn't being followed around by paparazzi all the time. I was able to be a kid and spend that time with my family and not grow up too quickly.
After 'Boy Meets World' ended, I didn't know if I was going to be lucky enough to work on a show with as many talented people and feel such a family comradery.
I'm finding that I tend to be one of those people who gets into very committed, long-term relationships, and then I really focus on that relationship and not so much myself.
I'm getting my psychology degree with a focus on marriage and family therapy.
