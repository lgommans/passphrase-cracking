You have to keep your sanity as well as know how to distance yourself from it while still holding onto the reins tightly. That is a very difficult thing to do, but I'm learning.
I considered Nat King Cole to be a friend and, in many ways, a mentor. He always had words of profound advice.
I have a line of clothing at J.C. Penney's... and I'm lucky to be affiliated.
I hope that there are no persons that would want to think ill of me in any direction or any behavior.
I've spent about that amount of time trying to tell the public that there was purpose in... my business, my career and the roller coaster ride... how the people I associated with worked together.
