I was always on set, I was always working, so my study was down to the bare minimum required. So I am one of the few who didn't study 'Lord of the Flies.'
Being on Twitter and social media, you obviously get to see a lot more of what people are thinking of you and of your show.
I started on 'Neighbours' when I was 14. It's crazy to think now that I had such a bizarre adolescence.
