I'm kind of a homebody. I like to sit at home and watch movies and eat good food.
My earliest memory is seeing Michael Jackson in Melbourne with my sister when I was about ten. I still have this souvenir stick with a glove that would light up and make a peace sign in a bunch of different colors. I'm so happy my mom didn't throw that out.
I love New York. I've always loved New York.
I always try and take something from each job.
I always felt like I was born in the wrong time period. I felt like I should've been born in the mid-to-late '40s.
I'd like to play with a period piece. Playing a girl next door in 2010 is so different from playing one in 1950, the way you talk, walk, dress, relationships. It's really fun studying all that.
I don't know if I really watched any Disney animation as a kid.
I think the simpler it is when you have a crazy character to play is almost more creepy and interesting.
I do love children, but I don't really talk about that in auditions.
I get recognised, but I'm not the sort of person who frequents popular clubs. I try to keep out of that.
Love is such an objective thing. I mean, I can say I love my family, or I love my Diet Coke. So I guess, in different ways, yeah, I do believe in love.
If you're getting ready to do a really emotional scene then, right before it, you're probably not going to be outside playing basketball.
