Canadian,Actress
I'd love to do comedy. And I think I have pretty good sense of comic timing, so I'd really like to try that.
One of my favourite actresses is Kate Winslet. She plays strong female characters and seems like she has a strong political awareness. I really like Naomi Watts and Juliette Lewis.
I'm a big fan of 'Woody Allen' movies, so I like all the actresses in his movies like 'Diane Keaton' and Mia Farrow.
My fans have been so great. I'll go on fansites and read messages they put, and they all seem like really nice people.
I have a huge passion for literature.
I love contemporary North American fiction and short fiction. My favorite writer is Jonathan Franzen, and my favorite writers of short fiction are George Saunders and Alice Munro.
