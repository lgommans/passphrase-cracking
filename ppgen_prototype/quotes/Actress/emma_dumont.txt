American,Actress
I was on a TV show about dancers for two and a half seasons called 'Bunheads' on ABC Family, and that was really fun for me because I'm a dancer in a real life.
I did an episode of a show called 'Mind Games,' which is no longer on the air, and it was an intellectual comedy-drama. It was just really smart TV.
I definitely am the sort of person that likes to be constantly learning things.
