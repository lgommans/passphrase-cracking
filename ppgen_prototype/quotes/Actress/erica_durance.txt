We all need to make time for a burger once in a while.
I constantly have anxiety about being the lead of the show. I don't talk about it because it scares me. But I've always wanted to be part of something where I could work on a character in such a big manner, and you get offered that with all the trappings of being the lead of the show.
I'm learning to embrace who I am and what I look like.
It's easier to shut yourself off outside than reveal your inner thoughts.
'Smallville' was my first love and it is always close to my heart.
If you think too much about playing an icon, it will immobilize you. You have to treat it like a fresh character. Sure, there are guidelines so that you don't upset people, but you have to find your own way.
The best beauty advice I ever received is to keep skin hydrated and limit harsh exposure to the sun. If you are set on the tanned look, there are plenty of great creams that will give you a healthy-looking glow.
I maintain my inner beauty by trying to lead a balanced life in general. I try to eat healthy foods, but... that doesn't mean I won't treat myself now and then! I work out almost every day, which gives me more energy and helps me feel stronger. I also try to be a genuinely good person to the people around me.
I'm a small-town girl, and it'll never be beaten out of me.
I look forward to change, but there is a part of me that absolutely dreads it.
I might do my own independent film, that my husband wrote for me, if all the ducks are in a row.
I'm a bit of a workaholic.
Any kind of advice that I've been given to cut out carbs forever, don't do it. It just doesn't work. You do okay for a while and then you just overcarb.
I'm pretty klutzy and I've always been, so I have to own up to it. It's part of my charm!
Well, I love TV, and I love a good script.
