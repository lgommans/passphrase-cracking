A good teacher who can take the zero pay and help kids develop physically, emotionally, socially, is literally an angel.
My parents have always said, 'You'll be so unhappy if you're no more than your career, that it's important to get out there and do things other than just your career.'
If an actor is bored, then they are boring to an audience. I definitely don't want to ever be that.
I actually wanted to be an astronaut, but I don't have a mathematical brain.
The great thing about acting is that you get to be a lot of different things in one lifetime. You get to explore different personalities and characters.
Honestly, I don't know if I'd want to be an educator. I find teachers to have more responsibility, in a way, than being a parent. You're molding hundreds of minds every year.
