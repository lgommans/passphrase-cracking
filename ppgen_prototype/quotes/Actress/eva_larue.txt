Charity should always be a constant.
I grew up at 'All My Children;' I got married, had a daughter and made life-long friends there!
'All My Children' taught me a great work ethic; you work so hard on a soap opera!
The Internet has been a great outlet for storytelling. After all, there are web-based shows that have started online and have then gotten picked up. I think it's a great opportunity for artists to get through the network roadblock. It just allows us another venue to be creative in.
If your potential mate does not have the same perspective that you do then you're going to be lost.
If somebody has never been married, they don't know compromise.
I think that if you start teaching about giving back and helping other people young, that will be a given for your child their whole life.
