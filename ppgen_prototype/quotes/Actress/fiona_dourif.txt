I have a different relationship with Chucky because he's been on top of my bookshelf in the corner of my living room for my entire life. He was a great tool for scaring friends, and when I see him in different theme parks I've been to, or in commercials, my heart swells a little bit, and I'm like, 'Aww! It's my Chucky!'
I feel like, sometimes, when things are just handed to people, in a way, right away, you don't get a sense of what the rejection and the struggle is like that comes along with life.
Chucky is absolutely still a puppet. He will remain to be.
I did an improv that was one of the most exhilarating ten minutes of my entire life. I mean, when you're doing it, you forget yourself.
I feel like acting is a ton of fun. It's the freest and most alive you can be.
I stopped watching horror movies after I watched 'Candyman' when I was - I don't know, fifteen or something. I remember my sister rented it, 'Candyman,' and it really, really scared me. And so it was only after I found myself in a horror film that I really went back and kind of rediscovered the genre.
I think if a horror movie is really scary, you'll think about it for weeks, and there's something kind of fun about that - about our art, really.
I actually think that's true, that we kind of create our own hell.
