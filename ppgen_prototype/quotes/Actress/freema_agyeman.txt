British,Actress
I appreciate individualism.
I swing between procrastination and being really thorough so either way things aren't getting done quickly.
I don't have an iPod! It's never appealed to me, really.
I love hotels for their solitude and comfort, but I believe a seedy one can have as much promise as a plush one.
I know it's really square but I'm one of those people who piles on the factor 50 as soon as I'm outside.
I'm one of these people that if I have a nice holiday - like I have had in Turkey repeatedly - I go back a lot.
I'm terrified of bugs and I travel with sprays, lotions, potions; the lot. I have to check the room before I go to sleep and if I come across a bug and fail to remove it I have to sleep in a separate room as I'm paranoid that I'll be taken advantage of as I sleep.
I'm not very glamorous.
I used to be absolutely addicted to the gym and I do still love it.
I always have to have breakfast before I leave the house, even if it's 4 A.M. and I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sustain myself if I skimped on food - I work 16-hour days, I need the energy, I can't afford to be stingy on what I eat.
I went to a very academic school that actually - when I got to the point of wanting to pursue acting, they just had no idea how to do that, because all of their contacts were very academic.
I was very much into science when I was young - I wanted to be a marine biologist, then I wanted to be a doctor, and then something else, I was always changing.
I'm fully aware that 'Doctor Who' will always, always be part of my life, and that's not something I would run away from in the slightest. I wear it with pride, definitely.
The way sci-fi works, you can never die.
I constantly make lists and itineraries and then can't stick to any of them.
My own style is one of not much effort.
I only unwind at facials and massages.
I've had journalists beg me to please say something negative about my estate.
Being short works for me.
