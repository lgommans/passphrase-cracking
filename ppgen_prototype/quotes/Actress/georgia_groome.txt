I was out with my mum when a man started screaming at me: 'Georgia Groome. I love you.' Mum and I just looked at each other for a split second - and then ran away as fast as we could.
You are what you are, and I'd rather be myself than try and be what I'm not.
I can't drive, so I don't need a flash car, and I like living at home, so I don't need a mansion. I'm sensible with money. It's not why I act.
Honestly, I was only rested in rugby football; all my friends were boys, and I definitely didn't want to go on stage, but I just did it to keep everyone happy. I did some singing, dancing like they liked, but it wasn't my thing at all.
I need good grades because I want to go on to do A-Levels. I'm just not sure yet about whether I will go to university, because I really want to see what happens with the acting.
I started out in theatre, and there's no better feeling than the adrenaline of being on stage.
'Tusk Tusk' is about a family of kids who are alone, the audience don't know why.
Playing Joanne in 'London to Brighton' was my first taste of film, and I loved every second of it.
I want to try everything I can; I want to push my boundaries and experiment with characters and genres that I have yet to try.
