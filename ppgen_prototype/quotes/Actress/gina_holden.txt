Canadian,Actress
As far back as I can remember, I wanted to dance, sing and perform.
Although I did end up trying out several different fields before committing to acting, I knew in the deepest part of heart that I wanted to be an actress.
I've been fortunate to play many different types of characters thus far. However, I really enjoy playing roles that are different than who I am personally. You can have these small fantasy worlds where you can be people you would otherwise never get to be: a doctor, a lawyer, a ruthless business woman.
I absolutely love any kind of outdoor activities like snowboarding, hiking, surfing, and laying out on the beach if I ever get the time... which is not often!
My brother is my go-to with scripts, especially when we're talking genre pieces, because I want to make sure that it's legit. I can love it, but then I pass stuff on to him.
I certainly do all sorts of work. I'm very, very blessed to do drama and other types of television, and things like that, but I always go back to sci-fi, whenever possible, because that's really exciting for me.
It's hard because I seek out strong female roles. I turn down a lot of stuff, not because it's not good, but because I don't want to play certain types of characters. I don't like to just play the pretty girl.
When I'm watching TV, I'm always drawn to those female characters who are doing something that I would want to do.
