To me, a lot of what makes a good actor is not what a teacher tells you to do but how you respond when you're on your own.
I had gone to the High School of the Performing Arts in New York City.
Scene study is isolated. I suppose it's interesting, but I don't think it really teaches you about a throughline. A throughline is something you feel when you do one scene followed by another followed by another.
I think a lot of good actors - for instance, Gary Sinise - have no training. His training was really entirely on his feet. I suppose you have to have an instinct for it.
