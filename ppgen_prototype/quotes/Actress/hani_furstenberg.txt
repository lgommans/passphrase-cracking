Israeli,Actress
I hope the English-speaking world can see that I'm not only an Israeli actress.
I've been able to work with great directors in Israel.
When I was growing up, I was teased for being too skinny. I went to summer camp when I was 11. I wore shorts, and the nurse said to me, in front of all my friends, that I was anorexic and that she had to monitor me to make sure I was eating. Because of that trauma, I never wore short pants or short skirts until I was 20.
For Americans I'll always be Israeli, and for Israelis I'll always be American. But I really have no need for definitions.
I'm an actress, and that's my work and my passion.
