American,Actress
I'm a vegetarian and change my hair color as much as I can.
I like a little bit of punk mixed with a little bit of feminine.
What I wear is constantly evolving. I am really big on comfortable clothes. I love soft, loose-fitting clothing that has some edge or something new/fresh to it.
Since I'm a vegetarian, I try to focus on getting my protein and iron needs met.
I don't concern myself too much about calories and fat.
