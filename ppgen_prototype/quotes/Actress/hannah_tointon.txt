English,Actress
To be honest, I am somebody that, as long as I have a character, it doesn't really matter if it's comedy or drama - I think timing is important in either. But for me, it's all about having a character to work on.
I'm never going to be a size zero and, to be honest I don't want to be.
Every girl has days when she doesn't like her appearance, but it's when you feel happy in yourself that you look good.
I did feel pressure to look a certain way on 'Hollyoaks.' But I just had to stay strong and not let myself get into a state of mind that isn't healthy.
