American,Actress
I did a lot of musical theatre when I was younger, so I would love to go back and do that again someday.
I am a longtime fan of 'Freaks and Geeks'.
'Gilmore Girls' was the first show I ever worked on and was my absolute favorite show at the time.
I haven't been on very many vacations, but I like Coronado Island, and Disney World was fun.
