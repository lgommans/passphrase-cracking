American,Actress
When I decided to become an actress, I think I let some people down. It was a kind of rebellion.
I'm always concerned that I'm insulting the elder statesmen on the set by my crass behavior.
One of the annoying things when you're in a movie is that gets talked about is everyone projects meaning onto everyone's intentions.
I totally love being on camera.
I was fortunate enough to have my kids early, so being a mom always ended up being a better gig than these other parts that came along. So I always justified not really working a lot because I had a family.
You can never empathize with your parents as a teenager. You just think they're just on another planet.
I love those shows where they go to all the greasy diners in America.
I'm such a Goody Two-shoes, but I get a vicarious thrill at someone sticking it to the Man.
I do wish I'd had a better career. Who wouldn't?
My husband and Charlie Sheen played Little League together. They've always been best friends.
The organization that it takes to make a movie like 'Star Trek' is amazing, intimidating and fascinating.
Point a light at me, and I'll start tap dancing.
