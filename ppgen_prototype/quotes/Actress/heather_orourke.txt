American,Actress
I did a picture for the First Barbie doll box.
I have a St. Bernard named B.
I pretend something scary is in front of me.
I read mysteries like Nancy Drew and Alfred Hitchcock, and I swim and I ride my motorbike.
Math - it's not my best subject.
My Panasonic typewriter can make graphs. It types in four different colors.
My parents put everything in a trust fund for me. I won't get it until I'm 18, so I'll use it for college.
The beast is not dead.
They used a doll when I fall through the ceiling.
