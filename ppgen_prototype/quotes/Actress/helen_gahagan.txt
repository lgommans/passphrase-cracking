When a marriage works, nothing on earth can take its place.
I realized that public affairs were also my affairs.
I became active in politics because I saw the possibility, if we all sat back and did nothing, of a world in which there would no longer be any stages for actors to act on.
I never felt I left the stage.
In trying to make something new, half the undertaking lies in discovering whether it can be done. Once it has been established that it can, duplication is inevitable.
