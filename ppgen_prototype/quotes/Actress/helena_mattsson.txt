Swedish,Actress
It's an honor to have people follow you and watch you. I do get a lot of fan mail and I read everything. It's very flattering and sort of surreal. I'm very glad that people like what I do and they want to follow what's going on.
I try to go to the gym a few times a week, but I admit, I cheat sometimes, and sometimes I don't go as often. I usually do more cardio and little bit of weights.
I love jewelry, I love bracelets, necklaces, but most of all I'm casual.
I'm sort of like a jeans and boots kind of girl. Casual comfortable. I like soft colors and solid colors.
Growing up in Sweden, I decided pretty early on that I wanted to go to acting school.
I just love to bake chocolate cakes and anything unhealthy. It makes me very popular.
