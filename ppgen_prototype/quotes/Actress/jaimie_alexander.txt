American,Actress
Never be ashamed of what or how you feel... just be honest.
I'm probably one of the worst actors as far as preparation goes, because I actually don't prepare. I find it easier to read the script and whatever hits me in my stomach, like deep down, I just go with it. And the director kind of molds me whether to go right or left with it.
When I was training, I trained with my younger brother Brady. I would wrestle some of my friends, who I had grown up with, which showed me some moves, but it was never a full on match. When I went to competitions, there were other girls, so I always wrestled girls.
There was one time I wrestled two boys and I beat them both! They weighed a lot less than I did and I think they didn't want to hurt a girl, so I don't know if I really won - I'd like to think I did.
Just for fun, I'm really goofy and I would love to do some stupid comedy. I'm talking, like, crazy, out there, Will Ferrell type of thing. I love it; I think those movies are so funny.
Chris Farley, I was a huge fan of his growing up. I would love to do something kind of slapstick and funny, maybe where I could change my look even a little bit.
I'm pretty healthy, most of the time.
I think that when people look at me, and they look at my height and my voice and my coloring, they automatically think, 'Tough.'
I will never be a waif. I want to market myself as a healthy-looking woman who is an action-star kind of girl.
I'll say this, I'm no stranger to working with a foreign cast, foreign directors, that sort of thing. I love it, because I think that when you have people from different countries, it sort of brings everyone together, it's more of a worldly film.
I actually read 'Wonder Woman,' and here's the thing about her: she's more of a physical presence than anything else. You don't get to really know her on the inside.
I was cast in 'Thor' back in 2009, so it sort of took me out of the running for anything tied to DC Comics.
