American,Actress
I think it's really amazing to have a big family. I've always wanted one.
I'm the oldest out of five.
In every role, a part of me gets to come out.
I've kind of stepped into my femininity.
I came out to California to live with my mom in Orange County for a while, and then I came up to Hollywood. I had just turned nineteen. I took an acting class at Playhouse West and decided, 'Wow, I think I can do this!' I studied really hard for three years before I got an agent.
I've always played way older than my age. It's the experience behind my eyes or something.
