When you start recognising that you're having fun, life can be delightful.
Keep smiling - it takes 10 years off!
I colour my hair mousy brown and I wear makeup only on stage. I use Laura Mercier - something called Biscuit, I think. I run one tiny sponge over my face and cover the red blotches. If I've got some rouge, I'll bung it on my mouth and cheeks.
If you fall in love with a country and its people, that makes any country warm to you.
A Birkin bag is a very good rain hat; just put everything else in a plastic bag.
My father was a painter, so I was encouraged to take a sketchbook everywhere. Cameras are perishable, but I still have tonnes of sketchbooks from all the trips I've ever been on. It gets you by when you don't know what to give people as a gift; drawings are good souvenirs.
When I arrived in France aged 20, I marched against the death penalty, which was an unpopular thing to protest against at the time.
I use Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream, Â£12, on my lips, and my arms if they're sunburned. I'm past caring that sunbathing is dangerous.
At school, I used to hear, 'You're a half-caste.' They'd laugh at my figure and say, 'Are you a boy or a girl?'
People always like things that seem exotic.
My distinguishing feature is the gap between my teeth. I had to wear a brace because my teeth used to stick out like guns from a fortress.
I'd rather live on my own than live with a face that looks at me with the wrong eyes.
If I were mayor, I'd invite everyone to have free boat trips on the river and free balloon rides over the city. I'd let the elderly in residential homes wander free.
David Attenborough... has that wonderful, breathy voice, and he's always so fascinated by what he's seeing. There's nothing about him that I can't find attractive.
I feel most comfortable in an old pair of jeans, Converse, and a man's jersey. My best friend cuts my hair with kitchen scissors.
I have to be careful not to get a paunch - I'm so skinny that if I put any weight anywhere, it'd be there, and I don't like a bulge. I wouldn't mind if it went on my bosom, but it doesn't.
Any film I see at two o'clock in afternoon with my mother seems to cast a strange spell that means we both come out sobbing.
He painted me when I was young because he was in love with me, but now that he has loved me he doesn't paint me anymore.
I don't know why people keep banging on about the '60s. I came from a conventional family and I didn't go off with different people - I rather wish I had now, seeing all the fun everyone else was having.
I grind my teeth and keep my thumbs in so tight that I've dislocated them, just not to scream. Sometimes as an actor one is lucky enough to be asked to scream.
I know what it's like to have someone coming home who looks at you not in the way they used to in the old days, and I've seen my own face contorted with sadness and rage in the mirror.
I love Dickens because it makes me chuckle to myself so. He has taken me to another world and out of so many earthly miseries.
I only like boutiques.
My mother was right: When you've got nothing left, all you can do is get into silk underwear and start reading Proust.
Robert Louis Stevenson... I'm focusing on the late short stories that I was ignorant of. I always thought he was a boys' author, but he's not at all.
When I was at school I used to scream in trains, in those concertina things between the carriages. I used to try to be so good that sometimes I couldn't bear it any more.
