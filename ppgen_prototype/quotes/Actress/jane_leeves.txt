English,Actress
Before I met my husband, I was just about to look into adoption.
I used to wear makeup all the time when I was younger. Now I go out and I don't care.
I don't have time to worry about looking cool.
I admire my mother. She raised four kids and worked and had no help.
A busy schedule can be difficult, but I have the best husband on the planet. He supports my endeavors, and we work as a team.
I am so blessed to be able to get up in the morning and go to a job I love, with fantastic people around me.
