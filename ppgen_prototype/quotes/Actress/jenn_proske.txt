Love yourself. It is important to stay positive because beauty comes from the inside out.
My goal is to be able to provide for myself and not have to worry about the daily expenses. I do want to be able to benefit from my work and make a good living, but I love it so much that I would do it for free.
I think that vampires are sexy. The idea of them being untouchable has been really exciting for people.
Twitter and Facebook are such amazing networks for me to introduce myself to the world and for fans around the world to introduce themselves to me.
I worked in theater my whole life. My mom was a drama teacher at my middle school. In high school, I was Drama Club President every year, and then I auditioned for conservatory acting programs.
I find the roller-coaster ride of auditioning most challenging. It's always about putting yourself out there, being rejected, and then getting back out there and trying again.
Being rich and famous has never been my goal at all. I love to act and I want to be able to do really great parts.
I do want to be able to benefit from my work and make a good living, but I love it so much that I would do it for free.
When I was working on 'Vampires Suck,' I must have watched 'Twilight' and 'New Moon' literally almost every day.
I went to Boston University and got my BFA, and performed Off Broadway.
I take class at the Groundlings, and my personal coach is Lesley Kahn.
