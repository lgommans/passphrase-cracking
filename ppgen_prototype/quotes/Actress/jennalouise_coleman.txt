English,Actress
If I'm with a group of people, I'm okay, but actually I'm quite a nervous person if I'm just one-to-one with somebody.
There's not much TV these days where you really get that element of surprise. There are so many spoilers all the time.
I'd love to be a Bond Girl.
I am a restless person.
I'd love to work across all three fields - theatre, film and TV.
To be honest, I don't think there's any other show like 'Doctor Who' at all.
I knew when I was 10 that I wanted to act full-time.
I like period drama because everyone is so restrained, but they have all these emotions raging underneath.
