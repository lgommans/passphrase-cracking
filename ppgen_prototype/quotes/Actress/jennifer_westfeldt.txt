Dogs just need you and love, that's all.
I'm pretty much honest to a fault. It's my best and my worst quality.
I'm not a parent yet, but I feel like a kid needs to be loved.
My mom and my stepdad are both therapists.
Well, you know, I'm quite a reluctant writer. I'm not someone who set out to be a writer or really wanted to be.
I always cry at weddings; they're beautiful, and I'm always moved.
As an actor on sets, I've always clocked how hard the crew works, how much longer their days are, how much lesser their glory is - and the fact that their commitment to the work and project is unwavering, no matter the budget.
I guess what I learned about myself is I'm a bit of a socialist; I want everyone on the set to get equal treatment and credit.
As an actor, I've always been interested in making sure I can perform the role and the lines in the way the writer intended.
I think film is collaboration, and I always want to hear everyone's input.
I seem to only write New York stories because it's the only thing that inspires or interests me.
