I think the power of persuasion would be the greatest superpower of all time.
I don't think that crazy should have a negative connotation - it just means that you're fun. I think that crazy is just a term that boring people use to describe fun people.
My parents have been married multiple times each, so the idea of being committed to somebody was scary.
At 41 and a half weeks pregnant, I started to have second thoughts about becoming a mother.
I was never the girl who yearned for children. I pretended to be interested in other people's kids, but that was obviously just an act.
I surround myself with bizarre people. They're more fun to write about.
I just want everyone to like me. That's my main flaw.
I've always gravitated toward men who sort of kind of eclipsed me in some way. And I think that it's because I have this need to be better.
I think, as a woman and as somebody in the entertainment industry, we have to be careful what we're putting out there and what we're trying to say.
I just hope that people, women specifically, embrace that side of themselves that maybe is a little nuts or that society tells us is crazy.
