I actually have a very real, irrational fear of zombies.
People love their comic books.
When I heard that 'Dracula' was being made into a series by NBC and Carnival, I couldn't resist. I knew they would do something interesting with it. A period drama with a supernatural twist seemed like a whole lot of fun.
Katie McGrath got me hooked on the 'Great British Bake Off.' It's ruining my life.
I have about 4 albums of Disney songs, but the embarrassing part is that I know each song word for word, and have dances choreographed for most.
When I was 12, I snapped my arm in two. My wrist still has a funny bump because they didn't join it back together so great.
