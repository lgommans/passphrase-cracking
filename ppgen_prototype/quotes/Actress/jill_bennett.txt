American,Actress
Never marry a man who hates his mother because he'll end up hating you.
Acting is something I love to do. I love to perform and I love the art, the craft of it.
I want to make films that make a difference. I want to be out and hope that that will make things better for gay people and for myself. I hope one day I can start to make the kind of projects or be involved with kind of projects that can really make a difference.
Outside of being an actress, I feel like being out is the biggest way that gay people can change perception. There are people that give millions of dollars to gay organizations but are closeted to their own families.
There are plenty of lesbians in Hollywood, but they're not out. And that's their choice, but I can't do that, it's too important to me.
We are in desperate need of a well-done romantic lesbian comedy.
When I am at a straight club, which is like once a year, if a man even looks in my direction, I verbally attack him.
