A lot of the offers I get are for these innocent 16-year-olds, and I turn down a lot of stuff because it's the same-old same-old. The whole point of wanting to act is trying to change it up, and I want to experience everything.
I would love to do some crazy action or even a real romantic comedy. I think that would be really exciting.
Video game fans are like nothing else. You can do so many movies or so many TV things, but video games is where there is just everyone.
