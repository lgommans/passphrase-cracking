On a really good day, if I'm really trying, in the morning I'll have a piece of toast, vitamins and nuts, or a bagel with a little cream cheese. Then at lunch time, I'll get me one of those Chinese chicken salads, a glass of juice, and a big glass of water.
I like to cook. We always sit down together, my daughter and I, and have dinner - baked chicken breast or a piece of fish with green beans, rice or potatoes. And I love pasta.
I'm not on a diet or anything. I do watch what I eat, though. But what I want, I get it. I learned when I was at 280 pounds, when I was in that life before, denial was not the answer.
I eat a lot of ice - isn't that ridiculous? I chew on ice, and I have maybe two diet sodas a day.
