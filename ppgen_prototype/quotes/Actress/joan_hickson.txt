English,Actress
I was lucky not to have been born pretty.
I wasn't beautiful, so there were plenty of character roles. I never did any Shakespeare, I'm far too superficial for that. I just act instinctively.
Miss Marple believes in justice and has very high standards. There is nothing you could say or do that would shock her.
I love getting back to Wivenhoe. I get out of my wig, bustle and costume in three minutes flat at the end of the play before jumping into a taxi outside the theater and catching the train home.
I thought I was the wrong shape: that Miss Marple would be much fluffier than me, much more wearing shawls and things. But I was persuaded, and now, well - I can only do it my way.
I have never been a star; I'm just an old character bag.
I watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the door opens, and there I am. The other day, I was wearing the most awful hat.
Retirement is fatal. Luckily, in my profession, you don't have to retire.
