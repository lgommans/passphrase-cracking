I always knew that 'Growing Pains' was not going to go on forever. I remember thinking, 'I'm going to enjoy every moment of this.'
I invested. I wanted to cushion the future. I'm a financial success!
Well, I'm directing a lot of television these days.
I act here and there but you have to commit so far out in advance when you're directing that you - I'm kind of booked six months out, so it's hard.
I don't cry. Well, you know, I think coming from an acting background that's really helped me because I more than anyone know that an actor creates a character.
The writer creates the role on the page and then the actor takes it and makes it their own.
