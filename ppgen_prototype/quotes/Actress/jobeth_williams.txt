Larry Kasdan wanted us all there, all the time, even if we weren't filming.
It was my first scene in any movie and my only scene in Kramer vs. Kramer. I was petrified.

I was concerned about doing a sequel and repeating myself. That was before I read the script.
I wanted to play the part that Mary Kay played, the lawyer who wanted to have baby and felt her clock ticking, because it was something I could relate to.
