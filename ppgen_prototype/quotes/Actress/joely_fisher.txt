It's challenging, but you have to at least try to eat right and exercise.
I didn't finish college, which is really weird because they awarded me the Alumni of Distinction recently.
I was like a race horse, just trying to get into the world.
I love to cook. I make an award-winning turkey chili.
I definitely have a Fisher voice.
I knew from the time I could walk that I wanted to be an actor.
I'm sure that my mom would have been happy with any path I chose.
You want the best for your kid, but everybody's career is completely different in this industry.
I am still learning every day not to watch other people's careers and compare.
I took up French boys and wine and I studied psychology.
I loved psychology and I loved history.
I was a backstage kid. I was in the wings looking out.
I was up until all hours of the night, listening to stories, meeting great old comedians.
I don't believe in depriving myself of any food or being imprisoned by a diet.
I just believe that whatever you put into your system you're going to see on your face and your body.
I am vegetarian, though, and so is my family.
At this point, I wouldn't be able to digest meat, and I don't like eating things with faces.
I've never been a waif; I have a womanly figure and always did.
I stay in my own little zone, and that's good for me.
My mom has this great skiing event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, every year for a local charity.
Skiing makes me feel great, and it gives my legs such an incredible workout.
I'm always on the quest for something delicious and healthful.
But unfortunately, when you have a kid, you sometimes eat everything they leave behind. So far today I've had some of her leftover pancakes with peanut butter.
I'm obsessed with cooking shows, even though they make everything look so easy when it isn't.
