There is nothing enduring in life for a woman except what she builds in a man's heart.
I am inspired by many mediums and use them to express varied aspects of my philosophies and life observations.
All of my work is based on nature. I grew up in a rural environment and living in the Bay Area allows for immediate access to wonderful natural environs. Basically nature is my Genus Loci, or the place where my spirit resides.
