American,Actress
I'm an actress and I want to act, and I'm a mom and I want to be with my kids, and it's trying to find a way to do both.
It's hard to make a living at independent films, at least in my experience. It can be hard to be really creatively fulfilled in some television. Between the two, I get a bit of both.
I think it's sad that there seems to be one definition of beauty in Hollywood/New York. It's such a cliche, but I think it's true that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.
If I wasn't acting, I would probably be working with children. I was a camp counselor growing up and I loved it.
I have a really beautiful mother. She is close to 60, and to this day doesn't wear a speck of make up or dye her hair, and everyone who meets her is completely dazzled by her. She seriously glows.
