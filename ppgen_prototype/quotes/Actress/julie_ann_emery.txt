American,Actress
There can be a lot of waiting around on any film set.
I feel like the 'NCIS' set is where people are allowed to be the nice human beings they really are. That quality is valued there.
I am beyond critical of my own work. I always tell actors they have to watch themselves 4-7 times in a given scene before they can be remotely objective.
I'm not so sure I 'like' to watch myself on film, but I do find it necessary in order to continually be a better artist.
It's true: I married my college sweetheart. We were so lucky to find each other at such a young age.
I would prefer to direct without also starring in the same project.
I love great writing. I like interesting characters. I like to work with people who push me to be better, to elevate my game.
