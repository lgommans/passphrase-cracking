French,Actress
I've never been a model; that's a misconception about me, and I don't know where it came from.
I wish I could be a model, and then I could have this fantastic body and parade around and get paid for it.
I have done several films, but I've mostly done TV, and 99% of the work I've done has been in Japan.
