Working is working. I love to work.
I was never about being a celebrity. Maybe when I was very young, but that goes away quickly. I've met almost every famous person I want to meet.
I guess I'm the queen of the Web series. Yeah, right. I'm not at all. I'm on 'Leap Year,' and previously I've done 'Supermoms' and now AOL's 'Little Women, Big Cars.' That supposedly did very well.
With 'Supermoms,' my ex-husband and father of my 15-year-old child was a writer-producer on that project. We're both of the mind that we should try and handle these changing times as best we can. He's very forward-thinking about brand marketing.
I just wish I got a quarter every time someone clicks on 'Little Women, Big Cars.' We had a 125-page script for this show. We used the creator's house to shoot. But it's expensive to do these shows. They're eventually not going to be able to get the quality of actors.
Most actors in my position, at 47, you want your annuity show. You want your Marg Helgenberger role on 'CSI.' But that's like winning the lottery. So you try and keep yourself sane.
I chose not to go home and struggle with the New York scene. My size sort of locked me out. I was too short for the stage. I would have been doing character roles, so I went to Los Angeles. There is a lot more happening out there. I also felt it was important to break away from my family.
