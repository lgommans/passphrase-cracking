American,Actress
I live in Brooklyn, and I love all the hipsters and all the artisanal bacon you can get here now. I consider New York my home, and L.A. a place that I go. I always say I go with an empty sack and try to fill it with as much money as possible to bring back to New York.
I'm just a stage actress. I'm very comfortable onstage.
I think that if Shakespeare had had access to CGI, he would have used it. Imagine Lear conjuring the storm and the lightning.
People who see no gray tend to convince others to follow them. If someone talks with great conviction and joy, people tend to agree with them.
I was raised in Austin, Texas, around trial lawyers. My friend and I - we were 14 - would go and watch her father try cases. I also heard of lot of Baptist preachers in little churches saying crazy things with such conviction.
I'd just love to have another TV series. I'll be the assistant D.A. on some crime show.
I think that, on television and in film, I will continue to be the mother to hot boys until, inevitably, I am their grandmother.
I think that there are laughs in all aspects of life. I'm not a planner; stuff comes along and you read it, and if it scares you or if you think, 'Oh my God, this is so good. I hope I don't screw it up,' then you should probably do it.
Frankly, I wish they would do 'The Bachelorette' for old people. And I could be the bachelorette.
