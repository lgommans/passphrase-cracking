American,Actress
I don't know, I like the word sassy.
I am very outspoken, obviously, and I should say that I can't judge anyone for doing anything.
I don't really think about doing something kind, I think there's just a way to conduct your daily life with compassion to other people.
I'm a reclusive weirdo.
I tried being anorexic for four hours, and then I was like, I need some bagels.
I'm really nearsighted, which has served me well.
I've never dyed my hair, never fixed my teeth or gotten a tan.
I'm really comfortable with myself.
I can watch a movie and go, 'Oh, my god, that person is acting.' If you just listen to what the other person is saying, your response will always be genuine.
The more unsettling the more I feel at home.
I was a very unique child.
I have nothing to hide!
I always hold doors open, I always try to be nice.
I was a Girl Scout!
I want to see as many movies as I can and I covet a lot of weird influential movies.
Quirky is what a guy would call a girl he doesn't understand.
I think you can tell when someone is being dishonest as an actor.
My mom took me to a Dolly Parton concert when I was 3.
There's stuff I don't like to rehearse, really emotional things, I don't like to rehearse. You just beat it to death.
I have friends who are so sarcastic but I never view it as mean.
I'm a very safe saver. I save everything. I save all my money and my parents raised me like that.
People make the mistake of drinking the Kool-Aid, believing your own hype, letting people tell you you're this or you're that or you're too this.
I'm from Pennsylvania, so I was in New York a lot and my brother lives in New York.
I was a home-schooled kid, living in the forest, and I didn't even have cable. I'm serious.
I wasn't a rebel.
I haven't actually studied acting at all.
