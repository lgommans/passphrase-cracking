Australian,Actress
What I like about Rebel's style of comedy is she never plays the victim... she's never been fazed by her shape; it's just the way it is. She would mock her appearance whatever she looked like.
I have a small family, but they are all still in Perth, and I am still very close with my high-school friends.
