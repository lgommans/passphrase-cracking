Being fired from a show - being fired in any way, in any instance, any business - is just hard.
I love working in London.
You just take any job you can that will allow your dream to come true.
I love Robin Wright. Kristin Wiig! I love those two women.
I graduated with a degree in musical theater and no skill in anything else to make money; I wish I had gotten a massage therapy kit or something where I could have made my own money.
I don't understand business minds. I consider myself an artist, and they just really don't mix.
I don't know if I necessarily fit in the action-thriller genre, but I'd love to do something where I could actually kick some butt and then tell a few jokes. That would be awesome! That would be my dream job.
