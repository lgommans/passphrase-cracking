I'm very lucky, coming from a great school.
I want to use things I learn about writing in my acting, and vice versa.
My perception of making a movie before I started making movies was that it would be like 'Spy Kids'.
I went to a haunted house once, and I don't do well in situations like that, and I've lived my entire life not being scared or anything.
People probably thought I was scary, but I was just uncomfortable with attention and tended to be a little closed off, except with friends. I learned to embrace the attention.
The first day of 'Bling Ring,' I was so nervous and freaking out. I'm a know-it-all and was going into a situation where I couldn't predict what would happen.
Now I've gotten to know more about the industry. And now that I'm over 18, I can work without my parents on set. That was nice and helped me get comfortable.
