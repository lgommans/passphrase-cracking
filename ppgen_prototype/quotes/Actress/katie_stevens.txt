American,Actress
I think that they way my parents raised me, they taught me to always follow my dreams and never give up, no matter what the obstacle.
It was a pleasure to work with everybody at 'American Idol' and to be able to be part of the 'Idol' family.
I'm going to keep pursuing my dream, keep singing and, hopefully, move to L.A.
I was overwhelmed when people started to know who I was.
