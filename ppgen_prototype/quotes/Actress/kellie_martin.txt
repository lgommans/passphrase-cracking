American,Actress
I love doing television series.
I wouldn't want to be a superstar, like Julia Roberts or Madonna, and be on the cover of 'US' magazine when I'm twenty - that's how you know you're really hot. I'd rather have a long, respected career.
I would say people remember me from 'Life Goes On' more than anything.
The way I choose parts is I look at the scripts... I choose a part by whether or not it challenges me.
I want to become a very good writer.
I want to know art.
It's not imperative that I graduate in four years, and it's not imperative that I get all A's.
