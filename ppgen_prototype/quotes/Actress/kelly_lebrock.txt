British,Actress
Success for me its to raise happy, healthy human beings.
My children are my whole life.
You're at the mercy of the editors' hands.
If you can't be with yourself, you'll never learn to be with anyone else.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
Love has many faces.
I've dated jerks, so why not geeks?
As long as my husband's looking at me, that's all I care about!
I could be like everyone else and stop eating, but that wouldn't make me happy.
