American,Actress
I love ballet. Ballet is its own being. It has its own vocabulary. I feel as if I am in a different world when I am in the ballet studio.
I make most of my friends through my extracurricular activities.
My style is constantly changing.
Any day acting is an amazing day.
I do lots of activities. I hang out with friends.
I really get a chance to be a normal kid.
I always try to read at night, because it gets me kind of tired.
I design some of my own clothes now.
I love organization, so I split my clothes into two closets according to seasons.
I hate a messy closet. I totally freak out when my closet is messy and I can't find anything.
I have a Twitter, but I'm not a tweeter... if that really makes sense.
I am a huge fashion fan. It's a really cool way to express yourself.
I'd definitely like to go to college some day.
I don't know if I've ever screamed or cried for a band.
I do listen to some music, but I don't technically have one band I'm absolutely hooked on.
I follow fashion trends.
I've been playing since I was 5, but I wouldn't say that I'm serious about the piano.
I certainly know quite a few kid actors, but I'm not really friends with them. They're all very nice people, but I just don't run in the same circles.
There's nothing wrong with a lisp.
I am always texting!
Some things are worth the splurge.
I'm such a theater geek.
