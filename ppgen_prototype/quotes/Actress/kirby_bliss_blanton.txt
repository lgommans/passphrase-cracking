American,Actress
I just feel so fortunate, A, that I'm able to talk to people and B, keep in contact with my real friends.
I just wanna be a DJ!
I have friends, I'm from Texas originally, and they follow me and they keep up with what I'm doing.
I like comedy a lot. I love comedy. It's so much fun, but it's hard, too.
I hear that I'm funny, and I think I'm funny, but I go in all the time for multicam, and they say that I'm not big enough, or I'm too big. I'm so confused. Okay, well, I'm funny in real life.
I like 'The Big Lebowski'. The Dude is my man. My brother and I can quote that.
I don't read much fiction because I already read a lot of scripts, so I want to learn about the world.
