Life is too short not to do a little practical joking.
I think there's an innocence to me.
At a pool party, with everybody around, a guy and I had sex in the pool, but nobody knew it.
I put a lot of faith in dreams. I know that big movie roles and opportunities are going to happen.
I love that men like to look at women, that they love sports, that they need to know the inner workings of mechanical objects. I love the whole makeup of men - that they never mature and are always just boys.
I think men are a beautiful creation.
I'm a firm believer that it's not the way you look or what you have, but what you've got inside.
Men are amazing. I love the way they are. They're consistently little boys, and they need to be nurtured and loved. But at the same time, they need to feel like men.
I love the whole makeup of men - that they never mature and are always just boys.
I want to clear up a few myths about myself. People have written that I was a kindergarten teacher and a former Miss Texas, and neither is true.
I basically left Texas with no money. I was making $3.50 working in some mall, so I didn't have a lot of cash. I took $1,000 and headed to California. Along the way I stopped in Vegas because I had always wanted to see Caesar's Palace. So I stopped there and won $2,500 on a slot machine! It was amazing.
I just didn't know what the heck I wanted to do with my life, so I drove out to California and got really lucky.
It seems a little self-involved to be like, 'Oh, he's hitting on me.' Maybe he's just trying to start up an innocent conversation.
I don't ever really notice when guys are hitting on me. I'm oblivious.
