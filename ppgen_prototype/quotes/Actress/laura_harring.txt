Life is wonderful beautiful journey. Every episode of my life is like a dream, and I am at peace and happy with what life has given me.
In private, I'm a hippie who follows Buddhism, does yoga, meditates and loves to dance wildly.
Unless you have a real passion for making movies, then don't bother. I had to carry energy and light into every meeting, only to be told, 'We don't want you.' I couldn't take it personally. You just have to wait, and live for those moments when the casting director likes you.
Some may think fashion is frivolous, but the way I see it, when you dress well, you add beauty to the world. And there's nothing wrong with that, right?
I feel fortunate that I'm able to play diverse roles. I don't think everybody in Hollywood gets the opportunity to do that.
For me, it's hard to keep up with trends. I just go for the roles and movies that I feel I could add value to, or contribute to, that I feel I could portray.
When 'Mulholland Dr.' was voted the Best Film of the Decade, that was very meaningful for me. That film opened up incredible doors for me, and I believe that that was the reason I was given opportunities to play all kinds of characters.
