Math is a language that you use to describe statistics, but really it's about collecting information and putting it in an order that makes sense.
There was an assistant professor I kind of had a crush on, but I was far too awkward and far too nervous to ever say anything.
I'd seen the movie 'Paranormal Activity' and was convinced for weeks that it was real.
I learn an amazing amount from watching television and movies because if you watch things that really work and don't work, it teaches you so much about what you do for your own craft. I think that if you're auditioning for a show, you need to know the world of the show, or you can't represent it very well.
