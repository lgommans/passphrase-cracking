American,Actress
I make movies for grownups. When Hollywood starts making them again, I'll start acting in them again.
You can compare me with Greta Garbo. I have big feet, too.
I'm not an oddball.
Breasts and bottoms look boringly alike. Faces, though, can be quite different and a damn sight more interesting!
