American,Actress
I feel like most actresses kind of have issues in body dysmorphia.
I kind of learned that I am way too tough of a critic on myself and that other people are not judging me as harshly as I judge myself, so I need to give myself a break.
When actors are comfortable enough, and you release all your inhibitions, and you stop judging yourself, you're suddenly so supportive that it's this wonderful team cheering each other on.
