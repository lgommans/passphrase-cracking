American,Actress
I really love modeling a lot. Once I am behind the camera and start moving, there's a kind of energy that makes me feel good. But I know I have to prepare for something else before I grow up.
There are so many beautiful girls who aren't photogenic. In real life, half the models you see look really hideous.
Sure there is a sexy attitude, and when they say, 'Give me a sexy look with your eyes,' you give it to them. It doesn't have to relate to the product. People are just drawn to it.
I live in a cottage and volunteer in the village shop.
