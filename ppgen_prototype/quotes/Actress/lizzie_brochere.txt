French,Actress
In my day-to-day, I do a bit of yoga, I go biking, I read, I watch shows, I go to music concerts.
Each time that I have two or three days off, I'm off somewhere in California.
I'm happy to work in the States because there are so many different and interesting projects. I'll go wherever people want me to work.
Of course I believe in aliens. I think it's very egocentric to think that there's nothing else with intelligence in the whole universe.
It'd be interesting to see a film from an alien perspective. Maybe we're the weird ones.
I just got my work visa to shoot 'American Horror Story,' and my official status is 'alien with extraordinary abilities.'
In France, we don't yet have the craft that American TV does or big studios like Paramount. It was so cool going through those famous gates when you have your own little pass and picture on it. Woo hoo, I'm going to work!
