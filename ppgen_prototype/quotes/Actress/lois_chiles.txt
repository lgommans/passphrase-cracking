American,Actress
I grew up in Alice, Texas, a small oil town with one theater that only showed Roy Rogers movies. So when I got the role, I had never even seen a Bond film and had only had a vague notion about the idea of a Bond girl.
Billy Barnes signed me and got me my first role in an interracial love story filmed in Atlanta called 'Together For Days' with Clifton Davis. My mother thinks it was my best work. You cannot find a copy of it.
