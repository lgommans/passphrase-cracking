I think the merging of high and low culture is so fascinating.
We have this idea of artists being on the fringe and being debauched and strange. I don't think that people who commit themselves to classical arts should be exempt from that.
The oboe is the most maddening thing of all time. I'm struggling to play something that my oboe teacher was doing when she was much younger than I am.
I will never be good at the oboe. No matter what happens, I will never be good at it because I just don't have that much time on my hands. I don't have the gift of going back to being a child and having my brain develop around this instrument.
The classical music scene was completely unfamiliar to me. It was something that I didn't have the most fun associations around. A lot of people don't - they think of older generations and stuffiness. But it's not. You listen to the Overture of 1812, and you can hear a rock n' roll catharsis.
As somebody who has wanted to be an actor who is very young, I can relate to somebody who has been practicing oboe five days a week since they were very young. The physicality of anything a character does is a tremendous gift.
I'm practicing the oboe. But I don't play. Just single notes, not an entire piece of music.
I'm the only one in my family with an American accent.
I spend a lot of time doing watercolors and playing music in my apartment.
I definitely wanted to be famous as a kid, but as I've gotten older, I feel less comfortable with it.
