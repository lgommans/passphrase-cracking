American,Actress
I want to do everything right now! This very minute. I am impatient, but yes I have goals. To be a real well-respected actress whom people know they can rely on to do a good job... whether they like me as a person or not!
I just want my audiences to be entertained and feel like they're part of the show. I want to show them a good time and create an experience they're going to enjoy.
My only interest in women's clothes is what's underneath them.
You want to see women your own age in films.
People always want me to talk about Wonder Woman, so I do.
I try to avoid cheese, dairy and a lot of meat, but I do like them.
I'm an adventurer and I enjoy all types of things, and eating is a part of that. It's just too bad we have to watch what we eat.
