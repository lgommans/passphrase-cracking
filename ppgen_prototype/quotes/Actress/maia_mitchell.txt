Australian,Actress
If I'm in work mode and going to meetings, I'll make an effort and dress up, but when I'm at home or just chilling, I'm in beanies and jeans and sneakers.
I play guitar and write music, and that's definitely a huge part of my life, but it's my personal thing that I have for me.
I'm trying hard to keep my Australian accent. My mom would disown me if I didn't.
It's fun to play dress up for work, but when you have those off-days, it's nice to just be low-key.
If I were to explore music, I'd want to just focus on that and make that my priority.
