American,Actress
I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be in show business!
I used to watch my Cuban mother getting ready singing 'Dos Gardenias,' so to me fashion has always been fun.
Heels I've always loved, but a wedge is perfect, in between glamorous and a common shoe. If going to the store, why wear flip-flops when you can wear wedges?
I can't live without a good scrub or concealer. Concealer could give you 8 hours sleep instantly. I also love lipstick, for everyday a berry tone that resembles the natural lip color.
'Marielena' was a wonderful experience that so many people still remember today. It challenged me to practice my Spanish. Having been born and raised in Miami, English was very much my dominant language!
I'm proud to be a hard working actress; it's what I've always loved to do and I'm so happy and proud to still be doing it.
My advice for young Latinas interested in pursuing a career in Hollywood is to make sure you love to perform and make sure you get the training you need.
