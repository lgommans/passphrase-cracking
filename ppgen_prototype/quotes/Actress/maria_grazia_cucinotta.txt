Italian,Actress
I took acting and elocution lessons, to get rid of my Sicilian accent.
I was born in Messina, Sicily. I stayed there until I was 18 and finished my studies.
Rome is magic, it's like being in Hollywood. But the difference between Hollywood and Rome is that here you don't have just the movie business. The movie business is so little, so you also have the choice to hang out with people who do different kinds of business.
I decided to an actress because of the film 'La Dolce Vita.'
It is so fantastic being an actress because you have the chance to be a thousand different people when you act.
It is better to laugh than cry.
I am curious, I love making discoveries, travelling, speaking with people, go shopping.
Give me something to do and you will make me happy.
