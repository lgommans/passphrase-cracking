I've never really been into the sci-fi genre myself.
A lot of people have been saying 'The 100' reminds them of 'Lord Of The Flies,' 'Lost' and 'Battlestar Galactica,' and all of those titles have been very successful and interesting to watch. Any time anyone refers to any of those great shows, I'm flattered.
