Actress
I've always felt like the reason I became an actor is because I look for more high drama than what I had at home.
First of all, Craig Lucas' work, any of it, for any actor, is such good material. It's so alive in such a poetic, yet human way. It's theatrical, but it lets you emotionally connect with the characters.
Since I got out of grad school at NYU, I've always done as many plays as I can.
