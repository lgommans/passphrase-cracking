Life is so fresh, life is every day so new if we are fighting, only for the best. Sometimes I think the only real satisfaction in life is failure, failure in your endeavor to do your best.
Don't be afraid of failure; be afraid of petty success.
When I was about 15... I made my first attempt as a leading lady, and was, of course, a complete failure.
I had very little confidence in myself as an actress.
Sometimes it seems that we are successful only because we have not tried hard enough for our best. We do the hard thing, and one day we succeed, and many things are made plain to us.
If I have smashed the traditions, it was because I knew no traditions.
You may shelve your Shakespearian plans for the present. I am going to play Peter Pan.
Genius is the talent for seeing things straight.
I've changed my mind about the interview. I shall never give interviews.
