It's a life-changing thing to be in a position of needing help and being so lucky as to get it.
You can't just take care of everybody else all the time.
Being bald is no fun.
Unfortunately in life, justice is not always achieved.
My answer to a lot of things is to go to work. That's not everybody's answer.
I'm not really the nurturer type.
I don't have much patience with sick people.
I tend to focus on what I'm doing at the moment, and that takes up the entire span of my focus.

Everyone in my family has seen me cry before.
I love Martin Amis.
I wish I had a little more joy of cooking - because mostly I have anxiety of cooking. I'm so proud when things come out well.
