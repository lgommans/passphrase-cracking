American,Actress
I was willing to do anything that Chris Carter wrote.
I started acting in my parents living room when I was five years old.
As for acting, I took drama lessons when I was in high school.
I would say Politically Incorrect is my favourite right now.
There's a big difference between sanity and insanity.
Actually, my favourite roles have been in theatre, but on TV, my faves were Slap Maxwell and Larry Sanders.
And generally the shows I'm in fail really big.
I have an assistant in Vancouver to help me with my life.
I would like to remain an actress, but am very anxious to direct and produce.
