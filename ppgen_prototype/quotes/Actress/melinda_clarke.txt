We had this scene where I'm supposed to be bending over to get something. I thought it was kind of cute.
They've turned this character into a human being.
I'm manipulating the audience. I'm making sure people sympathize.
I'm getting a lot of roles as women who are very powerful. I think that's a reflection of me as a person.
I was more of a light opera singer, not really much of a lounge singer.
Throw in the humor, throw in that personality, try things you wouldn't normally try.
Usually pilot season is very busy, and there are lots of auditions and lots of near misses and rejections. This year, I had two auditions, landed this role and it felt like being home again.
