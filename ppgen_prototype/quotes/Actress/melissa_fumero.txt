I lie to myself every day when I tell myself, 'I can skip yoga.'
I think comedy is so specific, so hard. I'd audition for comedies and think, 'I can't pull this off.'
I am so behind on all TV, and I love TV, but I literally, I get home so late, and when I get some time, I'm trying to catch up on my DVR.
I don't follow football, but I always watch the Superbowl.
You know when you meet somebody and they're just good people? That's Andy Samberg.
It's going to sound like brown-nosing, but I love 'Parks & Rec.'
Mindy Kaling is so smart and hilarious.
I'm realizing I'm not hip enough to know for sure what would be considered pop-culture.
