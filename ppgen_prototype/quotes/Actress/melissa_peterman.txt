That's what motherhood is: you're working; you're doing 25 different jobs, and you're not getting paid.
You don't have to stay where you are; you can make a change.
If I could have a time machine, where I could go back and tell 12-year-old Melissa that someday John Schneider was going to play her ex-husband, junior high would have been so much easier. I'd have had something to go for.
Stand-up is the scariest thing - whether it's TV, movies, improv - stand-up is the worst.
You get nervous when you're identified with something that is really great and positive for so long. You don't want to not be that person, but there are going to be other roles in your career.
I have been tossing around the idea of writing some non-fiction. Maybe a collection of short stories about my experience being a mom and how not to be perfect.
It's always possible as an actress that your last job could really be your last job.
I have a husband, and babysitters; I find it hard. I find it amazing how single moms do it.
I've always felt this, from when I was growing up to now with my son Riley. We don't let them be little. I was not a normal kid, but I had a sense of innocence far longer than we let kids.
I love to dance; it's one of my favorite things to do.
