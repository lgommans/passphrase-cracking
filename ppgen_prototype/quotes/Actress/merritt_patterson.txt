I really enjoy being outside in L.A. because it's so warm and sunny.
I generally wear jeans and a T-shirt - very comfortable.
Being outside and being in the sun is great for me.
I really like Rag & Bone jeans; I wear a lot of those.
Every Brit I met had the best sense of humor. They're hilarious: very dry and witty.
