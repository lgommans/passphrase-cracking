Haitian,Actress
When I was a kid, we lived in Italy, which isn't really known for figure skating. I think that's why I excelled so well. I spent a lot of my high school years training.
I love to cook. I'd have a dinner party, and someone would be like, 'Can you do this at my house?' So my catering partner and I - we were both struggling actresses at the time - thought, instead of getting a waitressing job, let's do what we love. We always said if things pick up, our acting careers come first.
I speak Italian, French, Creole and English.
I think it's really important for Haitians living abroad to go back and help with the development and infrastructure, especially because there are so many international people there.
