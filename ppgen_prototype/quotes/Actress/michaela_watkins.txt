Maybe women get to a certain age and they no longer have a filter; they're considered crazy people or something.
I get to do physical comedy! When do women get to do physical comedy? Very rarely.
'SNL' was a dream come true for me. It was a fantastic year. I don't have any regrets.
I just want to make people laugh, and I want to do that the best way possible.
I realize I love crazy ladies. Of course I don't like to think of myself as one, but maybe I am, too. I dunno. I'm always drawn to them; I think it's because I'm attracted to people who aren't in the business of people-pleasing: saying what they really think, not passive-aggressive at all.
When I got 'Trophy Wife', the first fear is, 'This could go away;' the second is, 'It's here and I love it; I hope it gets a second season.'
As far as celebrity, people don't stop me on the street and know who I am. It's more like, 'Doesn't she remind you of so-and-so's ex-girlfriend?' It's always somebody's ex-girlfriend. Somebody ex-girlfriend who's 'crazy.'
I do like to play people I wouldn't want to spend five minutes in a room with.
You know how when you're alone with your cat, your cat is kind of silly and goofy and kind of crazy? And as soon as people come over, your cat is like someone you've never met before? You know, poised. That's sort of what it's like working with Jennifer Lopez.
What's fun now is that I have a show at USA that I co-wrote called 'Benched.' I'm completely behind the scenes and not the actor at all.
I do think non-linearly. So I think that comes off as nervousness or anxiety in a person.
I actually have huge respect for Lorne Michaels. I think that guy is really something.
It was weird that most people knew me as someone let go from 'SNL.' I had the best time there, and in retrospect, it was the perfect amount of time. The only thing that matters is what you do with yourself in that moment after. If you decide, 'I'm the girl who was fired from 'SNL,' you're just that.
