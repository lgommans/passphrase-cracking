I think the only way you learn is to surround yourself with people that are better than you.
I was really shy when I was a child, very self-conscious about taking up space or being an attention seeker. I was the kind of kid who was really good at homework.
I got a BFA in Fine Art, and then I told my family I was going to be an actress.
In the beginning, I was actually embarrassed to admit that I wanted to be an actor.
I've definitely been in relationships with friends where I wanted to do something different than I know a friend has. It's that complicated balance between wanting to do what you know is right for you and not wanting to hurt someone's feelings.
It's so rare that you see a movie that you are genuinely moved by on a real level, and you relate to it, and you come out feeling uplifted.
I'm English, and my favorite movie is 'Manhattan.'
I sometimes listen to music to get into some place that I need to get. I don't think it's because I have a musician as a father that I do this - most actors do.
I have a really supportive family, which is really wonderful, but I'm not forcing everyone to watch my work every week.
I had wanted to act since I was a kid, but I had a lot of shame attached to it. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't think it was ever a possibility.
I had to pinch myself a couple of times that I was actually on stage at the Atlantic with Carol Kane.
I love being on stage. There's nothing better than that feeling; ever since the first time I was on stage, I was like, 'Oh, this is what it means to be fully alive and satisfied.' I don't think anything's as satisfying as a play.
