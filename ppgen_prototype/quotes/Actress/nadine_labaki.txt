Lebanese,Actress
I thought if my son was now eighteen years old and he was tempted to join the fight and take the burden of protecting his family - because it's always tempting especially for young men - what would I do as a mother to stop him?
I was watching TV and saw people with masks, weapons, and grenades. I thought, Is that really possible? Could we be here yet again? And go into civil war one more time?
Beirut turned into a war zone in a matter of hours. We were stuck at home, the roads were blocked.
I like to have the impression that whatever is happening is true.
A small film from a small country, in Arabic with nonprofessionals: It was practically impossible. Just to make it was like a dream to me.
I want to keep talking about my people and my country in my own language.
When people say to me, 'You make us proud,' it's heartwarming to hear that.
I don't like to be feared, and I can't work in conflict, I'm very bad with conflict. I try to avoid it, it paralyzes me.
I'm just someone who observes a lot.
