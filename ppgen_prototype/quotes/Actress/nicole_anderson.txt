I can't say that I've ever tried to hurt someone or humiliate them intentionally. My parents raised me to always be the bigger person or to treat others the way you want to be treated.
Never change the person that you are just to fit in. You'll find your true friends that like you for you, and if you are happy with doing things that you genuinely enjoy, it shouldn't matter what other people think.
I have gone to Niagara-on-the-Lake. You know, Niagara Falls in Canada. It's this cute little quaint town, and it's just warm, and everyone is so nice.
I was home schooled in high school but was definitely the nerd in middle school.
I was in three academic clubs, a huge book worm and the teacher's pet. I was kind of an easy target for bullies.
I had a couple friends from all the different cliques in school, but my true friends were my gymnastics teammates. I grew up competing with them for ten years.
I couldn't have gotten this far without my beautiful parents. I'm also very lucky to have the best friends that I do.

New Orleans is kind of dark in a very beautiful way.
