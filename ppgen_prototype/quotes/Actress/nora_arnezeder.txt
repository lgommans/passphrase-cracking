French,Actress
I'm very proud of 'The Words' and all the cast. I think Lee Sternthal and Brian Klugman are like new directors, and I really believe in them, and they're gonna rock everything.
When I was 14 years old, I was with my parents at a restaurant. Some people came in and said, 'Would you like to be a model?' I went to see them, and they said, 'You have to lose seven kilos.' I said, 'No, I want to eat French fries.'
