English,Actress
In life, I'm pretty low-key and quite non-descript.
My dad's an ex-policeman, and my mum is a sales representative, and they haven't got the acting bug. Bless them.
I did ballet and gymnastics, and then I started acting when I was eight - just doing amateur theater at a place called Oldham Theatre Workshop in my hometown.
My first big role was when I was 17 and I got the part playing Maria in 'West Side Story' in my school production.
I can't keep secrets about myself. I can keep secrets about other people, but if it's about myself, I'm like, 'blah blah blah blah.'
When I was filming 'Ouija,' there were some elements in that that really creeped me out.
'The Quiet Ones' was my first film, let alone my first horror film, and I had so much fun. I had such a laugh, every single day. I look like such a feral child in it.
If I love the character, then that's all that matters to me. It doesn't really matter what genre it is.
