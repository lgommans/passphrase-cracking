Australian,Actress
I can't even remember when I first went, 'I want to be an actress.' It's always been inside of me.
When I was younger, I did lots of plays, put on shows for Mum and Dad, made my brother dress up in ridiculous tutus and whatnot to perform in front of them. I think my pre-primary report was like, 'Has a flair for drama' - it was just a little side note.
With all the auditions you do, there is a lot of rejection you have to take as well. You get used to that.
I've done more than 70 auditions in about four years. Early on, it was hard for me because I'd become so attached to these characters, and then you'd be told, 'No.' I'd get very upset when I was younger. But now it comes with the territory.
I have two tutors - a maths tutor and another tutor who does all the other subjects. It is part of the deal with myself; I really want to finish school. I like learning and education, and I think it is really important.
Being flown to the U.S. to meet Sofia Coppola is really exciting. I was freaking out. I'm a little nervous, as I don't want to muck it up I want to do my best.
