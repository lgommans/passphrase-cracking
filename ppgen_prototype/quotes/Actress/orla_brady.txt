Mum asks why I am so often cast in adulterous roles. I think it must be because I am fairly flirty.
Everyone knew I was anti-marriage. I'd spent my life saying it was something I neither wanted nor needed.
Girls pour their insecurities into their looks.
If I saw my 15-year-old self now, I'd think I wasn't that bad, but back then I perceived myself as awful.
I went to Paris for a year in 1986 to study theatre; there was a lot of clowning around, buffoonery and fencing. It was then that my own style kind of blossomed.
I was a bit overweight as a teenager, which may be why I'm more comfortable playing with clothes than showing my body.
Clothes are interesting and they're there to be played with. I like the idea of costume rather than fashion.
Why not just have fun with clothes? We should be more light-hearted about how we dress, how we look. If you experiment, you can go wrong, clearly; but you can have a wonderful time doing it!
