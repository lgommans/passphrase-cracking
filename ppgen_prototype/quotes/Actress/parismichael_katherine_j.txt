They always say, 'Time heals.' But it really doesn't. You just get used to it. I live life with the mentality of 'OK, I lost the only thing that has ever been important to me.' So going forward, anything bad that happens can't be nearly as bad as what happened before.
The whole freedom-of-speech thing is great. But I don't think that our Founding Fathers predicted social media when they created all of these amendments and stuff.
I've had a lot of mother figures. But by the time my mom came into my life, it wasn't a 'mommy' thing. It's more of an adult relationship.
I never met anyone before who made me feel the way music makes me feel.
I've had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time. Plenty of people think I'm ugly, and plenty of people don't. But there's a moment when I'm modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer's telling me - and I feel pretty. And in that sense, it's selfish.
I consider myself black.
I have lots of memories of my father. He was an incredible father. We all loved him to death. He'd try to educate us as much as he could and was always looking out for us. He was very protective.
I want to have a normal high-school experience.
I want to help people; that's it.
I'd like to be an actress when I'm older. I sometimes do improv. I used to do it with my dad.
I originally wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid. Then I had this huge fear of black holes because my brother learned a bunch of stuff about it, and he's like, 'Oh, yeah, if you go into one you're never coming back.'
I do have, like, a regular childhood. I mean, I'm treated the same.
My dad was in the movie 'Moonwalker,' and I knew he could sing really well, but I didn't know he could act. I saw that, and I said, 'Wow. I want to be just like him.'
