American,Actress
I don't get hung up about anything really.
Women have said the most malicious, disgusting things about me. But I know that when somebody comments about you, good or bad, it is 99 percent of the time their projection of how they feel about themselves.
I'm working on my relationship with my mother and father, but my upbringing has been very destructive.
I don't ever wear makeup. I steam my face. I put hot water to open pores and cold water to close them.
I love Frida Kahlo.
I unfortunately had a lot of medical procedures throughout my life, so I decided to paint all of my surgeries as a way to heal and as a way to grow.
I think I'm attracted to outlaws because they make me feel safe inside, like a little child.
I love biker chicks!
It's amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you're on the street, begging.
I try to stay away from forced intimacy.
I love being in front of the camera.
I always hated school.
I just feel like everyone and their mother thinks they can be an artist. You can't. Sorry. I know I was born to be one.
When you're an actress you've got to keep your body as your sanctuary and your muscles.
I go to an acting class every Sunday.
I feel that when people hire me they know it's going to be a collaboration and that they hire me for what I give on all sorts of levels, from my movement to the emotion I bring to the project, the passion, all of it.
It's always freezing on planes.
I love going to the hair salon. I'm Spanish. I think it's more of a Latina thing to go to the hair salon.
If I collect anything, it's lingerie.
Cobras are magical. They can stand up on just energy alone.
I'm a real actress.
I've learned to stay away from publicity addicts, people who want to be famous for no reason.
I wouldn't say I'm a hostile person.
