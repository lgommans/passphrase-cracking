The whole Hollywood nightlife thing cracks me up. I can't work and do that stuff.
Years ago, I did an interview about my mother for a publication called 'Info' magazine, and during that interview I told the reporter about my mother's leiomyosarcoma. She had had a hysterectomy, but at the time of it, the doctors didn't even think to look for sarcoma.
Everyone needs all the awareness of sarcoma they can get. Twelve thousand people get diagnosed a year. That's too many. One percent of cancers are sarcomas, and about 15% of pediatric cancers are sarcomas.
I never thought I'd do comedy, ever, in a million years. I always thought comedy was just for fun - to me, the real stuff was the real dramatic stuff. Now I know it's all valuable. There's a real excitement, a good feeling when you can make people laugh.
I miss the summer nights in Dallas.
Performing has been part of my life since I was eight years old, so that's what I think I do. I don't think about the fact that it happens to be in a bigger venue where people get to know you, or they think they do.
