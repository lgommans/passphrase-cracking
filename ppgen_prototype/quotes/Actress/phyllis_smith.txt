Everybody wants to shine a little bit, even a wallflower.
Well, I think that in every character there are little bits and pieces of yourself.
As a dancer, one of my many teachers along the way made the comment that who I was onstage and who I was off were two totally different people.
In my heart, my first desire was to be a dancer. I always wanted to dance and I danced from the time I was 7 till I was well into my 30s.
IMDB's not the most accurate. Even my birth place and my age are wrong there.
