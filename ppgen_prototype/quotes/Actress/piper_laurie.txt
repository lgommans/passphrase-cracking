American,Actress
It took a long time, but I have learned that you just can't take anything you want out of life without putting something back in exchange.
I'm one of those people who has always been a bridesmaid.
I never forget, remember that. Not an action, not a name, not a face.
Back then, everyone was Lana and Rock. No one had ethnic names.
I've always felt robbed of something by people not knowing I was a Jew.
I dropped the script in the fireplace, called my agent and said, they can jail me, sue me, but I'm never acting again, unless I can do something worthwhile.
I was so flattered to be asked to be in the movies - the idea of being paid to act was heady stuff.
The fact is, I never wanted to be a movie star.
And if real life was like the movies, I should have lived happily ever after.
Believe me, when an actress is told that her very name is synonymous with bad acting, she's had it.
One thing is certain. The old Piper Laurie is no more.
And even then when you take it, you've got to take it with your whole heart.
