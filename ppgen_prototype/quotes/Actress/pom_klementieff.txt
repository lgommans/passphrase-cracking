French,Actress
There are so many forms of love. Spending time with friends, love stories. I enjoy showing my love by baking a cake for somebody and writing his or her name on it, and seeing his or her reaction. I love to offer flowers, too!
Being resilient is the essence of my life.
In life, I have male friends. They're just friends, and there's nothing going on, and it's beautiful.
My mom named me Pom because she said it sounded like a combination of Korean words that mean 'spring' and 'tiger.' So, it's very unique!
It felt like a pretentious fantasy to say, 'I want to be an actress.'
It's crazy that, as women, we are taught to be cute and nice and polite when we should learn to be less nice sometimes.
I always loved the Marvel movies. It was my dream to one day have superpowers, and that came true.
Sometimes I like to be comfortable and wear black jeans with a blazer, a really comfortable t-shirt, and low boots with heels. Sometimes I like to be feminine and preppy.
In everyday life, I use positive thoughts, sense of humor, Taekwondo, running, and yoga to make me stronger.
I never believed in God, and I will never believe in it.
I would love to be the lead in an action movie. I would love to be like Emily Blunt in 'Edge of Tomorrow.'
Oh, my gosh! Can you imagine learning boxing from Sylvester Stallone's character? I would die!
I'll be at the airport, and people will say, 'Mantis!' and I'm like, 'Wait! How do you know I'm here?' It's just crazy.
I love to create looks. It's just like you're a different character every day.
I think it's important to show that... you can't be perfect, and you have to embrace the fact that you're original, and it's what makes you interesting.
