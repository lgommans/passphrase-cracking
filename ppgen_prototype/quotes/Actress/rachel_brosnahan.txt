I think home has become my friends and family, wherever they are.
No one should ever be forced to choose between food and education, or medicine and shelter when they don't have the resources. It's very unfair.
It's very difficult when you have $1.50 per day to spend on food and drink, but for people who live this reality, that money also has to cover medical expenses and education, fuel and shelter - sometimes for an entire family.
I was under the false impression that I could sing in high school, so I did a lot of musical stuff. I can't sing or dance, so that was entertaining for everyone.
Home is where your rump rests.
You are the only you. That means you don't lose roles to anybody else. There's no competition, so they either want you or they don't want you, and it's not that they wanted someone else over you.
Eventually somebody will want me, and there will be a role that is mine.
Drama was all I ever wanted to do. There was no plan B!
I need to do more on stage. I've got to get my fix!
I can't take anything seriously.
I feel like I want to and have to do everything once.
It's a strange thing that we're actors, and we're always playing a character, and then suddenly we're at a place like Cannes, and we're getting photographed as ourselves, and you're like, 'What do you do?'
