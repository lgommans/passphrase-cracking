Canadian,Actress
I am tone deaf.
I'm always looking to do things that are really different from each other.
I like stepping out of my comfort zone.
Hawaii is absolutely beautiful.
There is no substitute for a real location when you're trying to shoot the jungle. You can't just go anywhere. You've got to go where it's lush and green and there really is those mountain ranges, the trees and the ocean.
I'm just basically a workaholic.
I'm obsessed with being human.
'Twilight's got some avid - and rabid - fans.
I can't play a character that I am judging.
My hair walks into a room before I do.
I volunteer with School on Wheels in Los Angeles, and I also tutor with Koreh L.A.
My awkward stage extended well into high school.
I actually did not have a date to my prom. I ended up taking a friend.
Most actors will tell you that it takes a while to figure out what you want to be because we just want to do everything we see on TV and don't know that 'actor' is a job yet.
I came from Canada, where it's freezing cold for seven months out of the year.
I feel like there's different kinds of evil and there's different kinds of villains, and as much as I would like to be dark and playing with knives... it's not me and it's not my look.
The thing I love about vampires that I find so fascinating is that, unlike other sci-fi creations, they aren't monsters from the get-go, they're human beings first... and so what kind of human you are would dictate what kind of vampire you would be.
I go to various boot camps 4-5 times a week, and I try to get some Pilates in there to thin and tone.
I drink tons of water. It always sounds like the lamest thing, but there's a reason you keep hearing this over and over again. It really works.
Dating and getting attention from boys was something that came later to me.
