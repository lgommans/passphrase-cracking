Painting is a hobby for me.
I think the joy of wanting to direct is having that nervous anxiety knowing your film is about to be shown and you're sitting right there with everyone.
Like when you go to a magic show and you know how they do the illusions. That's how I am when I watch any movies where they have people flying through the air.
Maybe they say they do but I don't think many actors really enjoy trying to do a Shakespearean play.
I find that actors who are wanting to pursue tv or films don't seem to have much interest in classical theatre.
