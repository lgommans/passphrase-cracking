I've had the great fortune of working with incredible people on many shows.
I do try to stay open and stay as present as you can be.
It's kind of amazing how well you can get to know someone without talking.
I would love to have read about myself being compared to Lauren Bacall.
I know you're supposed to be thick-skinned in this business, but I'm not. I kind of like to hang on to being vulnerable.
I didn't have cable when 'Breaking Bad' started, so I came to it late and kept waiting for a friend to watch it with, and could not find a single person who was not already into Season 3 and didn't refuse to start watching it from the beginning.
I think most people would struggle to define their whole relationship with just one label - like: my girlfriend, boyfriend, brother, sister, confidantes, whatever - but in those moments, there's true joy in each other.
