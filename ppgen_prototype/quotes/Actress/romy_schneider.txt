Austrian,Actress
Memories are the best things in life, I think.
I don't know anything about life, but everything about cinema.
One can remain eternally young if, each day, one grows rich by marvelous moments.
I wish to present myself in front of the camera, each time under the features of a different woman. I would like to live and apprehend the problems, the conflicts, the feelings and the impulses of women radically different from me.
I have the feeling that I was born in Vienna in order to live in Paris.
