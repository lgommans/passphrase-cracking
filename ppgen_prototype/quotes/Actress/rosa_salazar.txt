Canadian,Actress
I like very minimal stuff. I'm a tomboy at heart - and in body!
I wear American Apparel jeans every day of my life.
I can fall asleep on a dime.
I was just that kid in the family that you put on the table and watch it dance around, and you're like, 'Oh, look at that hyper kid!'
I told myself when I was broke and homeless that my biggest goal was just to have a house. That goal was achieved. I'm just really, really lucky.
I was that kid who was always practicing crying or falling asleep or being angry or being excited. I was that weirdo in my room making faces.
