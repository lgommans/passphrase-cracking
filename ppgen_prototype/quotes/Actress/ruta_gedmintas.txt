There are people in your past that you can't shake free from no matter how hard you tried. There's a certain process that you have to go through to say goodbye. That fire doesn't get extinguished. You have to put a gun to it.
I like to have fun on photo shoots.
Glasgow is an incredibly creative and culturally vibrant place.
My name is Lithuanian. My father was born there, and he gave me a cool name. It's the Lithuanian national flower - looks like a weed, a little bit like me! - although in Spanish it means a 'route' or 'road,' and in Swedish it means 'square'. So, not quite so cool in those countries.
I think trying to create intimacy on a set with a boom over your head can be a little embarrassing.
I'm definitely an advocate of the classic always taking your make-up off at night and always moisturising. I'll have a go at anyone that tells me they don't moisturise!
I can't quite warrant spending a month's rent on a pair of trousers!
When I'm going to events, I like Armani because I think they do a cross between my relaxed rocky feel and a really smart elegant look really well.
