There were certain films where I went, 'Oh, my God, I'm doing a movie.'
When you're in N.Y.C. and they shut down one of the bridges, this is a movie!
I never thought I wanted to direct. I love the control of it. I love to dream of scenes.
I just really want to do good work and work with some great people, people who challenge me.
I enjoy directing more when I don't have to direct myself. I like when I can just be the director.
You don't pass up roles that give you the opportunity to stretch and to grow.
'I Will Follow' is a celebration of life. Sometimes when you lose something, you understand its value more than when you had it. The same is true for life.
When a loved one passes, there are mixed emotions, and a thirst to live one's own life more deeply can certainly be among them.
Indies are always an extra challenge. The time is shorter because you have less money to spend and fewer days to shoot.
