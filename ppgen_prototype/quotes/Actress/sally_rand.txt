American,Actress
I'm not the type to sit on the porch and watch life go by.
I have never retired - I have averaged 40 working weeks a year since 1933.
I like boys. I am not foreign; I was born and raised in Hickory County, Mo.
When I first came out with my fans and the wind hit me, I almost took off.
I'm the original.
If you love living, you try to take care of the equipment.
What in heaven's name is strange about a grandmother dancing nude? I'll bet lots of grandmothers do it.
They planned this fair to bring business to Chicago, into the Loop. But you could have fired a cannon down state street and hit nobody, because everybody was out at the fair.
I haven't been out of work since the day I took my pants off.
