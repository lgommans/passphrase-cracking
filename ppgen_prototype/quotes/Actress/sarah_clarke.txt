I do Pilates two to three times a week if I'm lucky. Usually just two.
I definitely like creative, exciting adventures.
Being a mother of two myself - and two small girls - I think that single parenting is hard.
I have to say, I loved working on 'Men of a Certain Age.' It was a real shame when that show got canceled.
I always look for the writers and what they're creating. If it's something I don't buy, it's really hard for me to play it. To me, it has to be grounded in some sort of reality. It's really hard to go to these extreme places if they're not grounded.
There was a little movie I did called 'Women In Trouble' that a friend of mine made. That, to me, was a very satisfying project. It was shot so quickly during the writer's strike, and there was no money. It was a really fun project.
I would love to do a Western someday. Every time I watch any of them, I'm so envious.
