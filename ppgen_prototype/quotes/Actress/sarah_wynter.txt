I grew up with a younger brother, so I can get pretty rowdy.
Nothing turns me off faster than a guy being unkind.
I notice how well or badly a guy treats a waiter, or whether he's kind to some people and not to others. One guy I was with actually yelled, 'Get out of my face!' at a homeless man. Needless to say, there was no second date.
