When you read a script, you get a feeling from it.
When I graduated college I needed to make money while I was pursuing acting, so I read screenplays and made a living writing coverage on them for studios.
Stage work, that's all I have in my background. Wasteland was my first TV experience. Dawson's was my first long-term, I mean the entire season of 22 episodes.
My parents wanted me to go to law school.
My husband's a director, so he understands what I do.
I'm going to tell stories to the world. I think there's time for me to grow. We'll see.
I still feel like I have a lot of growing up to do 'til I find the voice. Everybody has their own voice and their own thing they want to say to the world.
I really love the process, with stage, of rehearsal, you get to create a character, and you have a beginning, a middle, and an end of story. And in television, you don't.
I prefer film and that's what I think I'm gonna put my focus on.
I just saw the movie for the first time in its entirely last night. It's really cool when you're in with an audience that's so tuned in and plugged in to what's going on.
I just don't want to end up on something that bores the hell out of me. Otherwise, I'll fake a knee injury and get out of there.
I entered into Dawson's Creek to do a couple of episodes. They weren't sure about my role in the beginning, but then the chemistry kind of worked.
I believe life takes us where we need to be.
I always say if you've seen good acting on television, those actors are really good. Because there's just not enough time. You don't have any preparation.
I actually wanted to be an exotic dancer, but that didn't work out so I thought I'd take on acting.
Hollywood looks to these young people now to say something to the world. I have nothing against that, I think a lot of people have things to say. But I think you need life experience.
