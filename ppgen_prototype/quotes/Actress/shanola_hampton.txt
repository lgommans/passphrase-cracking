I want to be a superhero. Maybe I'll be a bartending superhero who shakes martinis to save the world.
There is no justification for having an affair.
For breakfast I have grits, because I'm a Southern girl!
Eggs give me protein after a good work out. The cheesier, the better!
I do like adrenaline. Zip-lining is my favorite.
The amount of time it took me to get a show like 'Shameless' was definitely worth it because of the people and the material. I can appreciate it because I know what it's like when I didn't have a show.
With 'Shameless,' 'Homeland' and 'American Horror Story,' these are all shows that don't follow a particular mold, and they are out-there. The acting is spectacular.
I'm a TV addict.
Steve Howey is probably the funniest man in Hollywood. For real. He is just that person that can make you laugh at all times.
I'm such a workaholic.
There's something so grabbing about people who will do anything for one another.
You get so used to a world that you complain, but never actually want anything different. Why crave the unfamiliar?
Watching kids go from the age of 9 and 10 to 13 is a big, huge jump. The way they speak, their looks, their attitudes, everything changes as you go from being a little kid to a teenager.
I watch every 'Real Housewives' franchise there is.
Your body can't switch off tired. People fall asleep behind the wheel all the time.
I love comedy, but I actually do prefer drama because I am already animated as a human being.
I would like one day to play an FBI cop, just so I can hold the gun and shoot.
Teaching is so rewarding because when you see the look on student's faces when they get it, when you're able to excite them about what you're excited about; it's so rewarding, and it's so much fun.
Singing and acting on a show is like theater; it doesn't get any better.
