I'm very unpredictable. Very, very impulsive. Extremely. Absolutely! Sometimes I don't know what I want to do from one day to the next. I can't enjoy anything premeditated; I just do it as I feel it. But whatever I do is motivated by honesty.
I guess I kind of lived in a fairytale world... looking at everything through rose-colored glasses. I probably always will, to a certain extent.
Everything that's realistic has some sort of ugliness in it. Even a flower is ugly when it wilts, a bird when it seeks its prey, the ocean when it becomes violent.
My whole life has been decided by fate.
Sexiness is all in the eye of the beholder. I think it should be. Absolutely. My sex appeal, whatever it might be, isn't obvious... at least to me.
I don't fool myself. I can't see myself doing Shakespeare.
My definition of love is being full. Complete. It makes everything lighter. Beauty is something you see. Love is something you feel.
We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him.
My whole life has been decided by fate. I've never planned anything that's happened to me.
I guess I'm too outspoken.
I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly.
On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can't watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn't make any sense, does it?
