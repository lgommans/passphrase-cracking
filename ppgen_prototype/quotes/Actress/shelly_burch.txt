American,Actress
I've been waiting for Prince Charming like every other little girl.
The extent of my political involvement is that I'm a registered voter - Republican.
Washington Is kind of dead. It's a nice place, but It's not like New York.
I'm willing to be an open book, to a point.
I don't talk about politics much. I don't care for it.
It seems like I've always been singing, at least since I was 5.
I've been studying voice for quite a while, especially opera, for at least seven or eight years.
I am very ambitious.
Now that I am playing a movie star, I am ready to be a real one.
The reason I've gotten so far has to do with an extraordinary talent that I had nothing to do with.
When I'm not as humble as I ought to be, I tend to get knocked down. What I do is to glorify God.
