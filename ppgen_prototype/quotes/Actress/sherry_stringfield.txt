It's amazing how everyone has an opinion on how you should live your life.
Why does anybody want to be famous? You know what's important to me? Having lunch! Pasta! Seeing my friends! Is that so crazy?
They understood why I left ER. It wasn't just about a guy.
People can get certain good things out of fame, but until it killed a princess nobody ever talked about how bad it can be.
When you walk away from a really wonderful job like that, you start messing with everyone's priorities. It's like you're dissing them.
It took a long time to get out of my contract. The producers thought I was negotiating for more money.
It took the producers a while to realize I wanted a full-bodied life. I wanted to get out before I felt I'd sacrificed so much to get somewhere that I couldn't afford to leave.
I'm from the theater. I never wanted to be a star.
I played the best role I've ever seen on TV or film in the last five years. It was hugely gratifying.
I had my electricity turned off three times because I never had time to pay my bills. It was a joke. I'm making a ton of money, and I'm walking around my apartment with flashlights.
I'm incredibly happy to be doing my own thing in New York.
I'm a terrible patient, and I find that doctors can be very condescending.
Physics has the cutest words.
I love having no sense of tomorrow or yesterday.
You can't mess up. If you do, everyone wants to kill you.

Only the patients have to take off their clothes. I think I'm pretty safe.
I love going to the set every day, because Noah Wylie will be there waiting.
I never wanted to be a star.
I don't get rattled about the big things. I get rattled when I have to pick up my laundry, get gas in the car, pick up a script.
Series television is either a nightmare or the best thing in the whole world. It really depends on, I think, where you are in your life.
