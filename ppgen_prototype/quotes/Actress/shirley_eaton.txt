English,Actress
I've always been a creative person, and I'd always wanted to paint, so I went to art school and began painting and sculpting.
The reason why people are huge stars is nothing to do with acting. It's the magic. Charisma is a word that's used too often; it's something special, and it's what makes stars. It's luck, and basically, it's genes.
I'm very expressive, but I'm also a very private person. It is so hard to be private in the entertainment business.
A career is a career, but you're a mother until you die.
When women are stressed, they either eat too much and get fat, or they eat not so much and get thin, and the latter is what happens to me.
I eat what I want but in moderation.
Psychologists say don't expect your life to be happy all the time. I go with the philosophy that every day can't be tops. Life is not like that - it's up and down.
I am a great believer in naps, whatever age you are.
My mother sent me to dance and drama classes when I was young, and then I got a stage role in 'Set To Partners' when I was 12, followed by Benjamin Britten's 'Let's Make An Opera.'
I combined theatre and films with live TV, such as 'The Royal Variety Show,' performing sketches opposite Bob Hope and Maurice Chevalier.
I worked with Roger Moore on three episodes of 'The Saint.' He is a lovely man, a good director, and was my favourite actor to work with.
I don't even want to be on Twitter. I think it's abhorrent, people sending messages to say they're doing the washing-up or whatever.
It seems unfair that anyone can set up on Twitter using my name, or the name of any famous person, without any checks at all.
