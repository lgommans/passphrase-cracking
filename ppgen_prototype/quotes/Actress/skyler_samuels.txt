American,Actress
I'm from Los Angeles, and growing up here, I've always been enamored by Hollywood and the industry. It's just something I grew up with, and I loved it.
I want to be on the screen, I want to play dress up every day, I want be different people, I want to have fun, and I want to use my imagination.
I had a great time working on 'The Gates,' and that was my first real experience doing supernatural television, working with the special effects and everything that goes into making a supernatural show.
ABC Family is where the good stuff is at. I'm so excited to be a part of this network because they've really done a great job introducing shows that are heartfelt, exciting, and everything you'd want.
