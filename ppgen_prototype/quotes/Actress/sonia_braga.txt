If you take away money, if you take away the houses and things, who are we really? What is love really about? What is it to love each other? Why do we stay together, and why do all the kids split? All these questions I have really deep inside of me.
You can keep yourself alive. That's the magic of being an actor.
We can bring to characters dark and bright sides that nobody even dreams about.
The only thing I know is that we came from the stars, and that we have the same material as the stars. That's all that I know. Everything else I don't know.
I think Pedro understands the universe, the same vision I have, about relationships anyhow.
I grew up in a very open-minded family. My father died when I was very little, so my mother was really, really incredibly busy trying to provide for us.
And getting older, what's happening is, I play only mothers.
