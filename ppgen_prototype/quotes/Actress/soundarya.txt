Actress
I love hats, shoes, outfits, handbags, and ethnic jewelery.
Although working with Amitabh Bacchan was a different experience altogether, I just enjoyed it.
As far as I'm concerned I've never had a problem with anybody, no rivalry.
But if I had to do it, handle money, then I think I could be responsible, yes.
Everyone tells me that I have a very sweet face! I'd like to change that. I wish I had a more flexible face!
I hardly have any spare time! But when I do, I garden a lot - I love plants and flowers.
I like cooking but I don't know much and whenever I enter the kitchen, my mother sends me out! Because whenever I try a dish from a book, it comes out bad.
I'd like to be known for my character.
If I have to do something, I feel I should do it perfectly, and ofcourse, Hindi language is a problem.
Luckily I have a brother who looks after my administration and my money, because I'm a total spendthrift.
Not at all, I wanted to go into medicine. I took science in college. But my dad was a Producer - Director in Kannada films, and someone saw me, and one thing led to another.
