Things aren't always easy, but you just have to keep going and don't let the small stuff bog you down.
When I left New York, not a lot of shows were happening there, but 'Golden Boy' is such a New York show.
I am constantly playing younger. I have a baby face. I'm only five-foot-one, so I am used to playing younger. I love it.
It's a nice challenge to escape your reality. I think that's why actors do what we do. We like to play other people. It's therapeutic.
I like working one-on-one with someone, and I think that to go to a school of acting isn't really my thing.
My biggest thing to say is just don't worry about money.
