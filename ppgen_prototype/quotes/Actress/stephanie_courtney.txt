American,Actress
I'm sort of East Coast, so I like the off-white and the navy blues and the low-key preppy kind of thing.
I was never tortured over whether I wanted to become an actor. There was never another option in my mind.
I've never been one to book a ton of commercials.
People say, 'What are your hobbies?' I say, 'I've been doing shows ever since I was a kid.' When I left college, all I wanted to be was a musical theater chick. I auditioned tons. It just didn't pan out.
I was a switchboard operator on the first season of 'Mad Men.' I was the oldest and bitterest.
I was a boss on 'Cavemen.' That was portentous.
I landed about one a year. Just enough to make me question the gas money and all the driving in rush hour. When you audition for commercials, it's a lot of driving. What I netted wasn't exactly matching the hours I was putting in. I figured I'm not a face that makes people want to buy Lysol. Then I auditioned for Progressive.
