When children do not have three square meals a day, a proper education, and at least one adult who they know loves and is committed to them, it's very unlikely they will grow up to be productive citizens of the world.
Any society that doesn't take care of its weaker younger members is not one to be proud of.
I am thrilled to support World of Children and its superlative efforts to fund changemakers around the world. It's a great privilege to be associated with an organization that recognizes and funds those individuals really working in the trenches, and I look forward to being part of advancing positive change for children everywhere.
Charity only works when smart, innovative, compassionate people in the field are supported from home. The World of Children Award raises money and visibility for change makers, people doing the real work. We are a conduit for funding and resources only; all of our operating costs are covered by our generous board of governors.
I love New York City in the fall, and one of my favorite events of the season is the annual World of Children Award Gala, at which I have the profound pleasure of meeting the newest class of changemakers for children who are there to receive their World of Children Award.
Thinking about the heartbreaking number of young children around the world who think they are unwanted and are uncared for can easily keep you awake at night.
What I've learned is that makeup well applied can really last all day. I've had makeup on for 17 hours with minimal retouching. Once it's on me, and I start, I don't want to be touched again.
I've been embracing the red lip and just wearing it every day, not just for going out. And I get so many compliments on it. I love the Julie Hewett Rouge Noir: it's sort of a forties red.
I love Hindi films.
When I'm on the set at 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,' of course the content isn't funny, but the other actors are hilarious.
