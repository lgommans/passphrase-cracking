I'm a middle child, and I have a younger sister who is stunning - just beautiful and smart.
Being the lowest one on the totem pole is sometimes the fun part to play.
I remember seeing Amy Sedaris in a stint where she played somebody's alcoholic mother in one scene and in the next she was Ross Perot. I remember thinking she was so awesome.
I got to work with Rachel Dratch, and she just had such a funny, roll-with-it attitude when she would approach the stage and could turn anything into a gem.
Don't waste a moment of energy looking around at what other people are doing.
There are so many examples of people who have flourished by keeping their nose to the grindstone and doing their thing. Be persistent and don't give up.
Many people have done really well pulling their characters out; I think 'Wayne's World' really hit the mark.
All I can do is knuckle down, write something really good, and hope someone responds to it.
