There's no such thing as The Method. The term 'method-acting' is so much nonsense. There are many methods, many techniques.
It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years - I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank - there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.
As far as I can see, about the only thing I've missed is a college education.
I'd rather not marry an actor because there isn't room in the house for two egos.
My dad treated Marilyn Monroe more like his daughter than me.
A great performance like Lady Macbeth may be forgotten. Writing endures.
My acting career wasn't going where I wanted it to. I wasn't getting good parts. I got so bored with myself that I started writing.
