American,Actress
No one recognizes me. And I hope that I can always go out without being recognized. Maybe that limits you in some way but I like to be able to pull my hair back in a ponytail and get groceries without anyone noticing.
I was forever changed by my experience on 'Once and Again.' All of us who were on that show have deep connections... familial connections.
I always knew I wanted to be an actor. I was talented in college but not the most talented. But I knew I wanted to do it, and that intention got me there and kept me there.
I stopped eating beef in high school, and in college I stopped eating poultry. I am not a huge fan of factory farming and what we're doing to animals. I try to eat as clean as possible because I want to know what I'm putting into my body.
