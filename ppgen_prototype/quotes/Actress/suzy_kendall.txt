Movie stars are now less remote, less fantasized.
One can hope to be like Julie Christie, and with a bit of luck might be able to, but you couldn't hope to be like Rita Hayworth.
I want to avoid being labeled a sexy starlet, even at the cost of not working.
It's a kind of limbo, knowing what you want but not being quite sure how to go about doing it.
