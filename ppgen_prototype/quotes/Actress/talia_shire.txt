I have a feeling when I'm 80 years old I'm going to get a phone call: There's going to be another Rocky.
I could have lived off all the male careers in my family. Everybody was always getting ovations, but I was in the wings.
Our past is who we are, and death is one of our experiences. I lost my husband a long time ago, but it's always yesterday.
