American,Actress
I was the ugly duckling until I reached puberty.
Even if I get thrown out of Hollywood, I'll come back.
What I really want is a commercial hit. If you're in a hit, you're suddenly a star, whether you acted well or not.
I was never pretty, never really popular. I was lanky and funny looking.
