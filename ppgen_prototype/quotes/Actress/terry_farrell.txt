American,Actress
I wouldn't say the nightlife for anybody in New York is all that wholesome.
I wanted to be like Vivien Leigh in 'Gone With the Wind.' I wanted to have black hair, green eyes and break hearts.
I grew up on red meat and corn. But I don't eat like that anymore.
I like athletic men, but not like Arnold Schwarzenegger, though he's gorgeous. A guy's got to be sexy, optimistic, like to have a good time.
My eyes are different sizes, my nose is too broad at the bridge and squishes up when I laugh, and my lips are sorta funny when I smile.
Photographers and people do try to take advantage of you. You just have to stand your ground and prove you're not an easy target.
