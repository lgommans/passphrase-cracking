American,Actress
I really feel like I'm going to be an actress for the rest of my life.
I was not pushed into the business by anything other than my own ambition and my own dream of wanting to act.
Ordinarily during the stage of your life when you're going through your adolescence and you're completely awkward and uncomfortable, the rest of the world isn't watching you with bated breath. It's different when you're an actor and you choose to work your way through that period because it only makes it worse.
Just because one of your films does well at the box office, that doesn't make you a good person. It doesn't make you strong, smart, or secure, either.
I didn't want to become like so many of the young people I've worked with who have money, fame, and success but don't know who they are as people.
People know they have seen me somewhere, but they don't know where. They think I'm their next-door neighbor.
OK, I love 'The King and I.' I'm a huge Yul Brynner fan. I love the scene where they danced after the big banquet; that's one of my favorite scenes in a movie of all time. It's romantic and sweet and wonderful.
I've tended to play the outcast. I don't know, more nerdy types.
