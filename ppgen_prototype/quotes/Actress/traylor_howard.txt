American,Actress
I'm a below-the-radar girl. No one really knows anything about me.
In college, I majored - I can't believe there is such a thing - in advertising. And I worked in advertising and PR for a while, and I liked it.
As a kid, I went by Tray. In college, they called me Hitch. And Trash. And Park. All the usuals.
'Bram and Alice' is the best show I've done so far, and it only aired three times.
