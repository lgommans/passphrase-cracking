American,Actress
We're all terminal; none of us are getting out of this alive.
Do not tell somebody how to vote, just go up to them and tell them what Fahrenheit 9/11 meant to you. Fahrenheit will probably not win an Academy Award, but if you put it first on your list, it will become a nominee.
I used to get some ego thing out of saying I wasn't a star, just an actress. Forget it. I'm a star. I wanted it. I worked for it. I got it.
I'm painfully middle class.
I really want Americans, and all of us, to be less afraid of death, and know that it's a passage, but that - don't go to the funeral before the day of the funeral.
I'm trying to live every moment as much as I can.
Life does not owe me a shred.
We all have a way to contribute, to your community, to your family, whatever it is you can do.
