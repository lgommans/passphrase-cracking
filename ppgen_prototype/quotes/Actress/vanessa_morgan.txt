I definitely understand what it's like not having family around when you want them there, but you don't live in the same city.
My mom helped me get started when I was younger. I started with singing. An agent saw me singing on stage at the Palm Springs Festival, and recommended I get into acting, so I was like, 'Oh, okay.' I just started from there, singing and acting.
I was in a music class when I was little, and they discovered I had a talent and could sing. From there, I joined this singing troupe in California, and I would just go sing at festivals in this girl group and perform as much as I could.
I booked my first series when I was 13. Acting kind of took control because I was just going from part to part at that point.
