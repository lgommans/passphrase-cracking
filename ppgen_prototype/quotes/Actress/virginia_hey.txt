Australian,Actress
It's scary for me to act. It's terrifying. But I must be addicted to the adrenaline rush of the fear. It's like bungee jumping, I suppose. But after I accomplish it, I get this great sense of satisfaction and an overwhelming feeling of well being.
I like the beach and would also love to learn golf because I think it is rather elegant for an older lady.
When I was younger, my mum used to put fresh flowers in bath water instead of rubber ducks, and since then I had a love of perfumes.
