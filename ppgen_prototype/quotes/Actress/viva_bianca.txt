Australian,Actress
When I was a little girl at school, I really wanted to be Katie or Sarah or Sophie. When you're a little girl at school, you want to be like the other little girls.
You don't even really get used to doing scenes where you have to kiss, or be particularly intimate, with another person who's not actually your lover in real life.
I don't really like the gym.
My father is a very theatrical and dramatic person.
Film is where I want to end up, but I don't want to let go of theatre.
