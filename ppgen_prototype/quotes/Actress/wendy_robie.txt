American,Actress
When someone offers me a part, I say, 'Yes, please.'
When 'Twin Peaks' happened the first time, I was a stage actor in Seattle. I was called in for an audition for this pilot, and at that time, it was called 'Northwest Passage,' and nobody knew anything. I thought, 'Oh, okay, Lewis and Clark.' And from that moment, I fell down the rabbit hole.
I'm always glad to work.
The people of Butler Island spoke to me and demanded I bear witness for them.
I believe race is the great social problem of the 20th century. We did not solve it, and we are doomed to grapple with it in the 21st century. We must hear each other's stories.
If we could truly experience one another, we could end bigotry.
It's why we're actors: to be able to tell the stories that really matter.
