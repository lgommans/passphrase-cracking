South Korean,Actress
I grew up in New York.
You have to treat Hollywood like it's your boyfriend - he's there all the time.
If it's nice out, I swim pretty much every day for about half an hour. I have a great pool; it's very private and not too many people use it.
I'm not really into weight training.
I like to do Pilates.
I'm very good about eating breakfast, lunch and dinner.
I know when I was growing up in New York, whenever I turned on the television, I never saw a face that looked like me. Whenever there was an Asian person on television, it would be a huge event, me calling to my older sister 'There's an Asian person on television!' It was unheard of back then.
I love nature.
