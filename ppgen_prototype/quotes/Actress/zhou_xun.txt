Chinese,Actress
I think there are many faces to everyone. I also have my bad sides. Also I think everyone is trying to improve their shortcomings to become more wholesome.
Being an actress in China, I'm actually a very lucky actress... Especially now that Chinese movies are becoming more diverse with more viewers overseas.
I think it's the same to be an actress anywhere because the profession is about attitudes towards events - it is a process to try to understand life. I think this is the case for actors across the world.
It's not easy for Chinese actors to do foreign films, and it's not easy for foreign actors to do Chinese films.
I have an idea I want to test, for combining old peoples' homes and orphanages. Old people are lonely without children, children are lonely without parents. Why not bring them together?
In China, we think that if you want something to happen, you don't talk about it. So I will keep who I want to work with as my secret.
