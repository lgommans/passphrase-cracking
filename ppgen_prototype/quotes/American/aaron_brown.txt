American,Journalist
TV news is what you want it to be, and if you want it to be different, take a look at what you watch.
We are in the business of gathering the news. We're not in the business of talking about the news.
Television is the most perfect democracy. You sit there with your remote control and vote.
No one wants to hear the truth if it isn't what they want to hear.
I have no problem with the security... It's something that must be done for the times in which we live. Safety first.
I know the difference between journalism and a slogan.
