American,Actress
I want to make people laugh.
I'm not a stand up at all, it's such a fear of mine. My sister does it, and she's really great at it.
There are some different things I'm writing and developing, but I don't know where they'll go. They're fun stuff that I would be in and are written in my voice, for me.
I never really wanted to write and wanted to focus on acting.
I think you have to create your own stuff so I'm working on stuff for myself right now.
I'm young but I'm not stupid.
My dad was so much fun growing up.
