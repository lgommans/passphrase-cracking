You kind of need to weed through who is wanting to be a true friend.
I don't think I have any celeb crushes!
I don't really have control over my path - only the Lord does - but I do have control over my decisions.
My dream is to work with people like Meryl Streep, Michael Fassbender, Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett. To me, those are true storytellers - genuine people who have stories to tell and make incredible films.
I want make more records with my sister. I want to go on the road. I want to tour around the world. I want to continue to make great films and work with incredible directors that I respect and look up to.
For me, I just want to continue telling stories - whether it's musically or theatrically, this is what I love to do. So, I want to create more.
So many people grew up in the church, and you can have an awesome upbringing, but I made a personal conviction; I made a personal decision when I was very young. I enjoy going to church without my parents. On Sunday mornings, I want to go. Bible studies on Wednesdays... I have a relationship - not just through my parents.
I think you have to be guarded but not closed off.
