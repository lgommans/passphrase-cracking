Success is often the result of taking a misstep in the right direction.
A fool and his money get a lot of publicity.
Sometimes the fool who rushes in gets the job done.
To the victor belong the responsibilities.
If you want to recapture your youth, just cut off his allowance.
Spring being a tough act to follow, God created June.
Easy doesn't do it.
