I love looking at the old Bond films. Maybe it's purely out of reminiscence, the nostalgic things you think about. But there were some very good films made, and I think that the public has enjoyed them, too.
For every dollar you give away, you'll get a hundred back. And for every buck you steal, you'll lose a thousand.
