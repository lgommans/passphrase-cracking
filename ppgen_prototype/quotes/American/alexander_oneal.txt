My greatest day is yet to come. Of all the things that I've accomplished, my greatest day is yet to come. But it will never come if I don't pursue it.
Everyday I strive to, at least, recognise my short-comings and the things I have to do to be the best person that I can possibly be.
If my fans want to call me a love God, then so be it!
