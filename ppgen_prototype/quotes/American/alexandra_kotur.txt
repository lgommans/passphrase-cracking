Sometimes people come out of school right now and they immediately want a job doing something. And there's nothing wrong with just listening and learning and watching.
I think a closet full of things would actually stress me out.
I just think this whole thing about not wearing anything twice, I just don't understand it. I think things should be worn. You should bond with your clothing. It should be yours.
