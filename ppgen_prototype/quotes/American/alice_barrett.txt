So every single day, I found something to be grateful for and that's a powerful lesson.
In difficult times, it's so hard to look around and to see what to be grateful for.
I'm a just a mom when I walk down the street.
It's not an easy thing to be let go.
It sustained me... I can't tell you how much their support meant to me when I was leaving and coming back and even while I was gone, there was a part of me that knew people were pulling for me.
When I left the show, the fans were so amazing in terms of the outpouring of support and continued support all that time whatever ways they could be in touch with me.
Getting fired is hard.
But this is called show business, not show family.
I did a Broadway show with Alan Alda and how much money can Alan Alda have.
So I'm very grateful for everything that has happened in my life.
I did an episode of The Profiler. I actually worked on the last episode of Murphy Brown.
