I remember when we had to pick our major freshman year, I chose comparative religion. It came to me out of the blue. I am amazed at how interested I still am in those ideas, especially the way spirituality is expressed in the world and in art.
I should have more vanity.
I can really waste a lot of time on the Internet.
I'm just really a lazy homebody.
I'm not the neatest person in the kitchen by any means.
I myself have been in therapy. Repeatedly.
