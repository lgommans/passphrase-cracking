I like how I feel when I am in shape. I don't go to a gym; I run.
Running is very spiritual for me. It is therapeutic; it clears my mind and helps me to focus.
When you have a new baby, you can get really overwhelmed, since it's such a huge responsibility. You're thrilled to be a mom, but your sleep schedule is so thrown off and it can be scary if you don't have a good support system.
I've learned it's not about being famous and big money. L.A. can be a fun place, but when it comes down to it - and this might sound hokey - there's no place like home.
I realized early on that I always hated girls who used their femininity to get what they wanted.
When I was about 3 months pregnant, I was running, looked down, and there was blood everywhere. I totally freaked out, but the doctor said everything was okay, except that I had to stop running.
