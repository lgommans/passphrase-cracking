I tend to eat pretty healthy, though, and I work out - I work out hard.
I think of myself as a fairly attractive girl and always have, thanks to my mom. I was brought into this world thinking I was gorgeous because my mother was extremely devoted to this notion.
I'll never forget the day I realized I wasn't quite the Ford model I thought I was.
I like to create stuff. I like to express myself through jokes.
The last couple of roles I missed out on went to Jennifer Hudson, Jessica Biel and Olivia Wilde.
I feel very comfortable in my own skin. When someone makes jokes about me being heavy, it makes me mad. It's not true. I'm right where I should be.
I've always been really dark, and drawn to darker humor. Nothing has been forced, and I don't say anything for shock value.
I just say what I think is the funniest thing I could say. I'm not trying to make headlines. I'm just trying to say the stuff that I think is funny and will make people laugh.
I think you can go from being not very funny to working really hard for 10 years and figuring out how to make a living on the road, but I don't think you can rise much above that.
To be really great, you need to be naturally funny in order to stand out. But you can work at it, and find the best vehicle that you have to communicate what you're saying to people.
My background is in theater. I was a theater major in college.
