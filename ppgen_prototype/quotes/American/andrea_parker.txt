American,Actress
I am a trained, professional stunt driver. I'm a great driver.
I've been dancing since I was 6 years old. That kind of relentless dedication and intensity is where I'm comfortable.
I have a significant other and a large, immediate family. No children, thank goodness. And I have a 13-year-old kitty.
I have not looked at any of the 'Pretender' Web sites. I'm scared of the Internet.
