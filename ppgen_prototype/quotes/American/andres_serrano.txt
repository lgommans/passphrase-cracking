American,Photographer
I usually refer to myself as Hispanic.
I have always felt that my work is religious, not sacrilegious.
As a former Catholic, and as someone who even today is not opposed to being called a Christian, I felt I had every right to use the symbols of the Church and resented being told not to.
My work has social implications, it functions in a social arena.
Some people have compared the Klan images to ecclesiastical figures.
I am just an artist.
People have to find ways of explaining the work.
I think if the Vatican is smart, someday they'll collect my work.
I like the aesthetics of the Church.
I like Church furniture.
I like going to Church for aesthetic reasons, rather than spiritual ones.
In my work, I explore my own Catholic obsessions.
An artist is nothing without his or her obsessions, and I have mine.
I am drawn to Christ but I have real problems with the Catholic Church.
Oftentimes we love the thing we hate and vice versa.
Unfortunately, the Church's position on most contemporary issues makes it hard to take them seriously.
I like to believe that rather than destroy icons, I make new ones.
I have always felt that I am the sum total of my parts.
One of the things that I am happy about in my life as an artist is that I am not considered a Hispanic artist.
My work is intensely personal.
I don't think that because I am Hispanic I should therefore do Hispanic work.
Being born, especially being born a person of color, is a political act in itself.
I have never voted in my life.
Whenever possible, I operate outside the system.
I have never been able to see myself as fitting into one category, and I have never been able to limit my contact with people to one group of people.
I am an artist first and a photographer second.
