American,Philosopher
Nothing is given to man on earth - struggle is built into the nature of life, and conflict is possible - the hero is the man who lets no obstacle prevent him from pursuing the values he has chosen.
A hero has faced it all: he need not be undefeated, but he must be undaunted.
First, he must hold rational values, and to do this he must be a thinker.
A hero holds purposes appropriate to man and is, therefore, a thinker.
