American,Actor
I still can't shake the Nebraska off of me.
I've certainly played those leading man or male juvenile roles, where you're not supposed to make people laugh.
At a very early age I knew I wanted to be an actor and then more specifically that I wanted to be on Broadway and be in musicals.
Luckily for me I have a very supportive family and a loving group of friends.
I'm 6'2 and not a small person.
If you get into multicultural sort of casting for no other reason than to diversify, then it seems false.
I used to do community theater with Conor Oberst.
I haven't really made up my mind concretely about having kids.
When I was a kid, there were hardly any gay story lines or characters on television that I recall. Then when I was in college, 'Will & Grace' started up.
I've been pretty career-focused since moving to New York.
As an actor, particularly in theatre, you're trying to get jobs on TV; but you're also losing jobs in theatre to people who are on television.
I think as a young person, you're kind of game for whatever sometimes.
Even though I'm from the Midwest, the majority of my life has been spent on the coasts where being gay wasn't really much of a conversation.
I love doing both theater and television.
As an actor, you generally don't get to choose what projects you are part of, so I've been very fortunate that 'The Book of Mormon' was something I got to be part of. I don't want to be lofty, but it was groundbreaking, in many ways, for musical theater, so that was really thrilling to be part of.
My mother was predominately a stay-at-home mom.
Always my fallback is - I'm gonna move to a poor town and open a scone shop.
I am mildly addicted to Mucinex-D. I feel like I should just come clean about that.
I can't wake up at all without caffeine.
I live in the East Village, and occasionally people will recognize me there. When I'm in Williamsburg, I always get recognized. Midtown, not so much.
