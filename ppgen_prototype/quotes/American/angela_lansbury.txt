American,Actress
Here I am, I still go on, you know, like the tides.
I never regretted what I turned down.
The theater is magical and addictive.
I was put under contract. A major studio. I got nominated for an Academy Award. Isn't that ridiculous? I mean, at the age of 18!
We all have levels of performance.
A sitcom. I hate that word.
I don't think about going back to the theater.
I made about 56 movies, I think. Not that many.
Mystery is something that appeals to most everybody.
Clint Eastwood is an extraordinary director because he knows the value of a buck. He knows where it will show on the screen.
The Manchurian Candidate was the most important movie I was in, let's face it.
I have never directed. But I think I could. I have thought about it. I'm a bit long in the tooth to start.
I've worked with the greatest actors, and they're all gone. This is what's so desperate to me.
I think of myself as a journeyman actress. I will attempt almost anything that I think that I can bring off. It could be almost anything.
I started in London, as a kid. My mother knew I had sort of an inbred talent. She was an actress, so I inherited it from her. But I think I got a lot of it from my grandfather, who was a great politician.
Believe me, it jabs you. When you're on the side of buses and New York loves you, you love to go out there every night. It's like a race. Curtain opens, out you go, and New York is yours.
