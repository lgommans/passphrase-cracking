Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.
Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow.
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybody's heart.
Without a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community.
Treasure your relationships, not your possessions.
Set high standards and few limitations for yourself.
When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves.
Always be nice to secretaries. They are the real gatekeepers in the world.
Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it.

The most important things in life aren't things.
Focus 90% of your time on solutions and only 10% of your time on problems.
Listen to your intuition. It will tell you everything you need to know.
Have a strong mind and a soft heart.
Reality doesn't bite, rather our perception of reality bites.
Never let your persistence and passion turn into stubbornness and ignorance.
Become addicted to constant and never-ending self-improvement.
In order to succeed you must fail, so that you know what not to do the next time.
The only real failure in life is one not learned from.
The greatest gift that you can give yourself is a little bit of your own attention.
Don't fear change - embrace it.
Realize that if you have time to whine and complain about something then you have the time to do something about it.
When you're young, try to be realistic; as you get older, become idealistic. You'll live longer.
Build your reputation by helping other people build theirs.
The rules have changed. True power is held by the person who possesses the largest bookshelf, not gun cabinet or wallet.
You must first get along with yourself before you can get along with others.
