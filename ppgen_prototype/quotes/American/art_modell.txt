I do want to go out on top, as a winner.
The pride and presence of a professional football team is far more important than 30 libraries.
I have a great legacy, tarnished somewhat by the move.
I never give up on my players, and I'll never give up on people.
I don't want my grandchildren to go through what I went through.
I had to do what I had to do to keep my family alive. Period.
I have enjoyed the years enormously in Cleveland and especially in Baltimore.
I never lied to a person in my life; my kids didn't, either.
I want to be remembered as a guy who tried his best and did his best.
If you start becoming withdrawn and looking over your shoulder, being careful about what you say, that's being paranoid. This is an open, accessible team. That's been my trademark for years.
That got us started on revenue sharing, and we couldn't have done it without all the teams.
The quality of ownership is not what it was in yesteryear.
