When I was a teenager, my parents made me take a part-time job at the local Black Eyed Pea, which was a home-cooked-food family restaurant.
Someone can do three episodes of 'The Bold and the Beautiful,' then turn around and book a primetime show. That's happening all the time.
I think if people want to go back and look at season two of 'True Blood,' I'm proud of my work in that.
I used to be on 'The Bold & The Beautiful'; that character, Bridget Forrester, is dear to my heart, and of course, the reruns of that you can see.
I'm really proud of an independent movie called 'Angel's Perch' that you can get now on demand. It's a labor of love. People worked really, really hard, and it's a beautiful film.
