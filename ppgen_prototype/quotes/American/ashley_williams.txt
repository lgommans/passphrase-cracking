I'm not a person who can spontaneously say funny things.
It's very rare that I put makeup on.
'Something Borrowed' is looking like a romantic comedy, but it's a comedy. It shines as a comedy; it's definitely not just about the romance. It's an honest depiction of the struggle between the characters. The comedy aspect will make it shine.
I did a TV movie with Tom Cavanaugh. He was the perfect partner, I learned so much from him. I would do anything with him again.
I need to work with people who are kind and giving. I can't work with someone I'm scared of.
I think it's such a challenge to tell a story, and I think, to be honest, the shorter, the clearer, the better.
We were very kooky and inventive, and it didn't take long for my parents to realize we should all be auditioning for things.
People recognize me, but I get a lot of, 'Didn't I go to camp with you?'
