American,Actor
I was bullied in elementary to middle school. It messed with my self esteem.
There's so much in American history that has been hidden and shunned.
It's awesome that my job is to make people have reactions.
I'm getting the training I need to progress as an actor. If something comes up and I have to drop, I'll drop.
There are so many stereotypes of how you have to be as a black man, growing up in the community as a man.
I was skinny and black and didn't play sports. And I was bullied.
I like to have fun and be myself and express myself through how I dress.
Hollywood is showing respect for all different types of art.
We're raised to believe that black men have to be one specific way.
I feel like a lot of black men 'put on' because of what they see and because of what people tell them they have to be.
I bury things in the back of my mind I don't really want to deal with.
There's so many strict ideas and rules, whether it's from religion or it's just generations and generations.
Despite everything that's going on, people need love.
I don't think things will lead me astray, as long as I'm tapped into myself.
I want to keep doing projects that speak for people within the community and tell different types of meaningful stories.
I definitely wasn't the kid playing sports. I was super different.
I'm acting! And doing it for income! But it's for something that I love, and that's super rare.
For my career, I want to be able to do projects that have serious context to them or that make me grow as a person and an artist after the experience.
A lot of these artists are out here don't stay true to why they started doing this in the first place.
It's about being true to my artistry, which I've been doing. It's super important to do smart films.
I didn't know that '12 Years a Slave' was being filmed at the same time we were making 'The Retrieval.'
