American,Politician
I'm a conservative Republican, and I'm not a member of the Tea Party Caucus, but I have very good friends that are.
If you go through the regular process of the House and Senate passing companion bills and then try and work out differences in the conference, maybe we can get something done.
The time away from the family is the hardest part of the job. I have a little apartment in D.C., and I have to tell you, I'm happy when I get to go home to Georgia. My wife and I are also talking about whether we can afford the apartment or not. If not, I guess I'd sleep in my office like a lot of my colleagues do.
I'm tired of the U.S. getting involved in every country's individual disputes.
It's our duty as leaders in Washington to keep the government running.
All Americans should be exempt from the atrocities of Obamacare - no exception.
