American,Musician
When I rap, it's just an extension of how I speak, and that's how I talk. If you don't like it, don't listen.
I don't want to talk about Nicki Minaj anymore.
I've been making music for a while. And I could read about myself on the Internet for a while.
The beats are like scripts, and the raps are my monologue.
Nowadays when I walk around, I get noticed, which is kind of weird.
I don't live on other people's terms.
I'm also not going to explain something just because I said it in a rap. Take what you want from it.
Life is the same. It would be the same thing if I were still working at Starbucks, having to deal with a manager, and a shift manager. This is a job.
