Life started getting good when I started making money.
When you go in and do a cool, small character, it feels less like work and more like fun.
I think some people are on a mission to die, and I never was.
Even in my darkest times I knew I had a good future ahead of me.
I wanted to be a professional baseball player.
Like, they know that I have a habit of rubbing my earlobes, I've been doing it since I was two.
My mom just understands about stuff. We have a really good trust, and she knows I can take care of myself.
My parents were hippies.
My theory is, independent movies only work if you're willing to push the material and do something different.
I had a very modest upbringing.
Nobody believes it, but I slept on a futon till I was 13.
The big things I've had are things I bought myself.
I didn't do the typical things that young kids do.
I wasn't ever good enough to be on the baseball team and that sort of stuff.
Even the great bad guys in cinema history, they're likable.
But I've consistently worked for 10 years.
It's been such a group effort. When you're a new band and you have limited resources, you end up getting people that are there because they love what you do, and that's great.
