It might seem unfair to reward a person for having so much pleasure over the years, asking the maize plant to solve specific problems and then watching its responses.
If you know you are on the right track, if you have this inner knowledge, then nobody can turn you off... no matter what they say.
I know my corn plants intimately, and I find it a great pleasure to know them.
I never thought of stopping, and I just hated sleeping. I can't imagine having a better life.
