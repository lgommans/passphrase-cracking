Career is too pompous a word. It was a job, and I have always felt privileged to be paid for what I love doing.
I'm now the Lord of the Brighton Manor.
My only problem is finding a way to play my fortieth fallen female in a different way from my thirty-ninth.
Egotism - usually just a case of mistaken nonentity.
