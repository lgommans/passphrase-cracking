If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.
The writer's object is - or should be - to hold the reader's attention.
I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning until the end.
If a man is a writer, everybody tiptoes around past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not professional.'
After the war, when my husband came home, we had two more children, and domesticity for a while prevailed combined with beginning the work I had always wanted to do, which was writing a book.
When the children were very small, I worked in the morning only, and then gradually, as they spent full days at school, I could spend full days at work.
