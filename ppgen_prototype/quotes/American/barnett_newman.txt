American,Artist
I hope that my painting has the impact of giving someone, as it did me, the feeling of his own totality, of his own separateness, of his own individuality.
Any art worthy of its name should address 'life', 'man', 'nature', 'death' and 'tragedy'.
I prefer to leave the paintings to speak for themselves.
