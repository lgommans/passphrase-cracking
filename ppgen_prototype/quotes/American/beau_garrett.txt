American,Actress
I'm such an advocate for animal rights and environmental rights.
I was a model for eight years. That's the deal: People look. But I didn't like being looked at and never seen.
Acting is an uncomfortable business because you have to make yourself vulnerable.
I lived in Paris for six months when I was sixteen. It was a fend-for-yourself environment.
