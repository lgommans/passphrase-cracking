'Farscape' is a story about family. It's a story about creating life in a harsh environment. That's what a lot of people relate to in the story.
'Farscape' is not what you call hard science fiction.
The nice thing about 'Farscape' is that you got to be the good guy and still do the bad guy things.
How could you not wanna be in 'Doctor Who' at least once in your career?
