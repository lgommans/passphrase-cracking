I'm not much of a joke writer.
It's in my wheelhouse to be creepy, as a person.
When I was a kid, we sat around the house. If I got bored, I'd have to figure out something to do.
The one thing I did know - because I've seen many, many of the road trip movies that everyone thinks about - is that death to a road trip movie happens when you spend too much time in the car.
