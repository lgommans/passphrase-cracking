Usually after I'm done with working, I just come home and play a little game and go to bed. After work, I have a lot time to do a lot of stuff. I think I've got a good balance of work and play.
I guess other people's compliments motivate you.
Sometimes I like to draw.
In acting, you can always grow and get better - even if you think you're at your limit.
For comedy, timing is key.
I was watching TV one day, and I'm like, 'How did those people get on TV? I'm gonna try that. Hey, mom, I want to be on TV!' And she's like, 'OK, let's get you an agent.'
