I consider myself a lesbian, but I'm a bisexual lesbian.
We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it's a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.
Men are hung up on breasts. They're looking at the titty dinner. It's pathetic.
It's very hard for a man to ask questions about sex. The smart ones do.
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice! That's the condition of the female. Women have been conditioned to sacrifice for centuries.
The person whose face is between your legs is gonna get lockjaw.
The media only wants to get the view of the flaming radicals because they make better copy than those of us who are more sensible. I'm a feminist and I think I've done a lot of good.
When I do documentaries, my best information ends up on the cutting-room floor. People have trouble dealing with sexual honesty.
If you go out to dinner with someone, you find out what they prefer in food. We ought to be able to have a conversation to find out what people prefer when it comes to sex.
