American,Actress
I'm not an outstanding personality, and I'm certainly no beauty. Acting ability is all I've got to trade on.
I just want to do as many utterly different parts as I can get. Variety teaches you to act, and it keeps you fresh in your approach.
I think it must be awful not to work. My only point in being idle is to rest so that I can work more... I'm only unhappy when I'm not working.
