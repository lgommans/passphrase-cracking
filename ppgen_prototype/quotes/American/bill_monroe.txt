Bluegrass has brought more people together and made more friends than any music in the world. You meet people at festivals and renew acquaintances year after year.
Practice every time you get a chance.
I'm a farmer with a mandolin and a high tenor voice.
I was determined to carve out a music of my own. I didn't want to copy anybody.
Bluegrass is wonderful music. I'm glad I originated it.
Country music belongs to America.
