My whole feeling in terms of racing is that you have to be very bold. You sometimes have to be aggressive and gamble.
Being a runner means you are now 'free' to win and lose and live life to its fullest.
To be a consistent winner means preparing not just one day, one month or even one year - but for a lifetime.
Anybody can be a runner... We were meant to move. We were meant to run. It's the easiest sport.
I believe in gradual experimentation with running shoes.
Age 50 is a lot tougher than 40s.
Every race is totally different.
Hills are terrific for running.
I always say if the marathon is a part-time interest, you will only get part-time results.
I believe in keeping running simple and, in regard to shoes, that would mean no gimmicks, unnecessary cushioning, etc.
I believe you'll develop speed via strength work which includes hill running, either repeats, or running hilly courses as the Kenyans do on a steady basis.
I like rain, actually.
I ran my fastest marathon in the rain.
I want to run until I can't run.
If you want to win a race you have to go a little berserk.
My biggest weakness as a endurance athlete has been in not drinking enough water after training, thereby racing sometimes while dehydrated.
My guess is many top athletes, distance runners included, use performance-enhancing drugs, enough so that the problem must be tackled.
The marathon can humble you.
The starting line of the New York Marathon is kind of like a giant time bomb behind you about to go off. It is the most spectacular start in sport.
You cannot always run at your best.
