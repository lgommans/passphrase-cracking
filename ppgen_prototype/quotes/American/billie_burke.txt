Age is of no importance unless you are a cheese.
A woman past forty should make up her mind to be young; not her face.
An actress who has the gift of swaying the emotions of an audience, of compelling tribute of tears, or of moving the public to joyous merriment, cannot always be satisfied to set aside her whole career, in the work that she loves, simply because she is married.
Age is something that doesn't matter, unless you are a cheese.
But if people will laugh at my work and keep a sound roof over my head, who am I to complain?
I think when an actress marries she should leave the stage. She cannot be happy if she is married and remains on the stage. She must care more for her art or for her husband.
If I ever loved a man better than I love my art, I should marry him and leave the stage. But I have never met such a man.
There is no reason why marriage should necessarily compel an actress to forego her career.
