She raised me to not think of men and women as different. She raised me without gender. It's kind of the reason she named me Billie. It's not about being a strong woman - it's about being a strong person.
My whole life, they said, 'Do not act. You need to get a college degree'.
I am not a big horror freak. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat in general. I can't handle scary movies unless I am at home with the lights on and the doors locked or it is in the morning.
I am a Southern girl at heart, so I have a pulled pork sandwich and Key lime pie every day. It's a problem.
I went to NYU, and my parents had a rule that I needed to major in something other than acting if I wanted to pursue acting after college.
The great thing about women directors is that they're not only involved in the performances - they can gauge where we all are personally and know how to direct us better because of that.
When you walk onto any set, it's usually primarily men. Which can be weird, especially when you're doing something emotionally challenging.
My mom made me watch 'Star Wars' for the first time when I was about 7 years old. When I was younger, I hated action movies and pretty much anything loud. So when she put it on, I covered my ears and ran out of the room.
When I first started acting, everyone in my family did not want me to act.
I went to performing arts camp, secretly taking classes - I got the lead in the musical, and my dad was like, 'Wait, I thought you were going here for music and knitting'.
I'm living the dream right now.
I want my mom on 'Scream Queens'. She could play someone who is convinced she's Princess Leila. That could be her disease, and then as a plot twist, we could find out that she actually is Princess Leila.
