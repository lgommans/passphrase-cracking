I do believe that God has his hands on me and that he has work for me to do.
I had been inspired by an organ player named Earl Grant, who played organ and piano together. My mom took me to see him. So I went home, put my piano and organ together, too.
I would never do anything to hurt anybody, especially if they're helping me. I'm not that kind of person.
I'm playing with Bonnie Raitt. I don't have to sing it. I just have to play it. That's cool.
The Beatles did treat me as a member of the group. And that was a great honor, you know?
The first time I met Ray, I was going to school around the corner from his house. One day, he was playing the piano. I eased up on the porch to listen to him.
