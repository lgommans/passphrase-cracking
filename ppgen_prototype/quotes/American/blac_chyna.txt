I enjoy an evening stroll. It helps me to reflect and eases stress.
I am just as comfortable in sweats and sneakers as I am in a dress and heels. Attitude is everything!
Most of the time when you're around the opposite sex, you kinda have to put on a show and not completely be yourself.
I always liked having my own money and buying my own stuff. I didn't want to depend on somebody to do it for me.
Wigs are my best friends. They let you be whoever you want to be.
Despite my high profile on social media, I'm a private person.
I like to cook as much as I love to eat, and I will eat pretty much anything if it's prepared well!
I don't care if it's one dollar or a thousand dollars - I'm going to go out and get it.
I want to show people that I am that good friend and the person that a lot of people actually come to confide in or even, just, to be around that good energy, because that's what I'm all about.
Tyga takes King to school, I take him to school - we pretty much split our time with him down the middle. So, co-parenting isn't bad at all with Tyga.
Anyone I'm with has to love my son just as much as they love me, if not more, because I don't play any games with King.
