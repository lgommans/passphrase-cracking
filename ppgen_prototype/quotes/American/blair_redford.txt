People like casting me as these characters who definitely have an edge to them, but I don't really think 'bad boy' is something anyone can say about themselves without sounding stupid.
I definitely don't like anyone messing with my friends or loved ones. I'm quick to step up to the plate if there's a problem.
When I first meet a girl, I have some questions I go through if I'm interested in her. Like, if she's a good-looking girl, and I figure out right away that she doesn't read, that's a dealbreaker for me.
I don't think you can totally judge a girl based on her circle of friends and loved ones, but I think it's nice to see where she's spending her time.
