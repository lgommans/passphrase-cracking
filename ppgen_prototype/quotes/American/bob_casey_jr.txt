American,Politician
I don't support gay marriage, but I also don't support a constitutional amendment banning it. However, I do support same sex unions that would give gay couples all the rights, privileges and protections of marriage.
If two people of the same sex fall in love and want to marry, why would our government stand in their way?
Pennsylvania is home to some of the hardest-working, toughest, most decent people in America.
So often, generalizations don't apply to Catholic voters. Catholics are concerned about the war, the economy, about issues like abortion, issues pertaining to the budget and funding Medicaid and Medicare and what happens to the environment.
Pennsylvania couldn't be prouder of our native son, Joe Biden from Scranton. No one knows us better than Joe.
Barack Obama and I have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion.
I know Barack Obama. And I believe that as president, he'll pursue the common good by seeking common ground rather than trying to divide us.
Catholics are every bit as diverse as any other sort of voters out there, with conservative Democrats and moderates.
I do think there's a difference between what a religious leader says and does and what a public official or legislator does. But there's no question that a lot of our legal underpinnings find a good bit of their foundations in the Scriptures.
Sometimes I, as a public official, turn to Scripture or hymns - especially hymns, because sometimes we Catholics don't have the Scriptures memorized like we should - to help me explain a public policy position or an idea or to be able to articulate it better when you're talking about justice or mercy or compassion.
After much deliberation, and after reviewing the legal, public policy and civil-rights questions presented, I support marriage equality for same-sex couples and believe that DOMA should be repealed.
