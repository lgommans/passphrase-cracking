Bing was always hesitant to accept appreciation in any form.
He wanted me to learn to stand on my own feet, and to make it impossible for me to thank him.
But just as I was ready to call it quits, I got the necessary money from a third party, who had been instructed by Bing to help me out, without letting me know where the help came from.
I didn't want people to say his brother Bing sings better than he does.
I think probably the one trait that would concern me about brother Bing would be his lack of responsibility.
