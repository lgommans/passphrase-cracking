My purpose in public address and in speech is really encapsulated in three C's: clear, concise, correct. No overblowing rhetoric or anything like that. As simple as possible: clear, concise, correct.
I was born in Queens and spent many years there. After I got married, I moved to Kew Gardens, then moved to Baldwin, Long Island, where I still reside.
I played baseball as a left-handed first baseman, though never as well as I did quarterbacking.
Nobody, but nobody stays a public-address announcer for more than a couple of years. Truly. Public-address announcing is not a career. Public-address announcers only work 81 days a year, so you don't make a living.
