American,Celebrity
America is totally under control of the Jews, you know. I mean, look what they're doing in Yugoslavia.
I consider myself to be a genius who happens to play chess.
I felt that chess... is a science in the form of a game... I consider myself a scientist. I wanted to be treated like a scientist.
I don't want to look like a bum.
There isn't a woman player in the world I can't give knights-odds to and still beat.
The U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians, just slaughtering them, for years. Robbing them and slaughtering them.
Nothing is so healing as the human touch.
Chess and me, it's hard to take them apart. It's like my alter ego.
Chess is life.
I like the moment when I break a man's ego.
There are too many Jews in chess. They seem to have taken away the class of the game. They don't seem to dress so nicely. That's what I don't like.
All that matters on the chessboard is good moves.
I am boring. I am boring!
I don't believe in psychology.
The white people should go back to Europe, and the country should be returned to the American Indians. This is the future I would like to see for the so-called United States.
I want to see the U.S. wiped out. Death to the U.S.
When I won the world championship, in 1972, the United States had an image of, you know, a football country, a baseball country, but nobody thought of it as an intellectual country.
All I want to do, ever, is play chess.
I don't remember one thing I learned in school.
I don't listen to weakies.
Nobody has single-handedly done more for the U.S. than me.
Ultimately the white man should leave the United States and the black people should go back to Africa.
I hate ready-made suits, button-down collars, and sports shirts.
I don't believe in hero worship.
I was never invited to the White House.
Now my only income is a few royalty cheques from my books.
