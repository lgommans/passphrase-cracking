The biggest mistake to me is complacency.
My parents weren't at all in entertainment, but when I look back, something along the line prepared me and opened me up to entertainment.
I'm very lucky that my husband is a true partner in child-rearing. If I get home late, he gets home early or vice-versa. I travel more, and he's able to spell me when I'm gone.
My parents did great and provided well, and gave all their kids personal, moral, ethical values, not a belief that we were entitled to something.
