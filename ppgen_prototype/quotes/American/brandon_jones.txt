I'm a singer-songwriter. So I play guitar, and I sing. Along the lines of, I guess you could call it, alternative rock.
A lot like Dave Matthews or John Mayer, I kind of stick with the acoustic genre.
I'm a huge Twitter dork! That's the best way for fans to keep informed about what's going on with me.
I play the role of Andrew Campbell on ABC Family's 'Pretty Little Liars'.
