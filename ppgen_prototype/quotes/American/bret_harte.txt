Never a lip is curved with pain that can't be kissed into smiles again.
A bird in hand is a certainty. But a bird in the bush may sing.
The only sure thing about luck is that it will change.
We begin to die as soon as we are born, and the end is linked to the beginning.
Man has the possibility of existence after death. But possibility is one thing and the realization of the possibility is quite a different thing.
Never a tear bedims the eye that time and patience will not dry.
