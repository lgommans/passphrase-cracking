The best part about a first kiss is right before the first kiss.
I like to do things in which I'm playing someone else entirely.
I listen to a lot of old stuff like Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, and The Temptations.
I love memoirs and autobiographies in general.
Just open, honest communication is the best thing in the world.
Breath mints and Chapstick are key if you want to have a good kiss.
The best kisses have something behind it - maybe something has been smoldering for a while, and it's about to happen.
