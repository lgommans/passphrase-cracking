American,Comedian
I don't watch 'American Idol' - that'd be like getting divorced from somebody and then hanging out with them.
A joke's a joke; you can either take it, or you can't.
My dream was to win an Academy Award. But my other dream was to win the Super Bowl, and there's a chance that might not happen, either.
Some of my favorite shows are Ricky Gervais' 'Extras' and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm.'
It's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy: the great comedy that comes from great pain.
I wanted to be a performer, not someone who introduced other performers.
I do standup every week in L.A. at the Laugh Factory and the Improv.
There's a lot I've yet to say about 'American Idol,' so I am excited about teaming up with 'Idol Go Home' and starting my blog.
