I love my baby more than anything. He's like a Gerber baby. He's the cutest baby in the whole world.
I'm in no rush. One day I'll find a nice guy.
I don't ever have time for friends or anything like that.
I want to do public speaking and cause campaigning. I want to write a book.
Never lie to your mother. That's like the biggest lesson that I learned, learned throughout my life, you know?
I'm an athlete. I'm strong. I'm tough. And that's how women should be. That's how they should be built.
I'm a normal sized girl. I'm not a size double zero; I don't weigh 90 pounds. I'm a healthy girl.
People just need to be confident in their own skin and be proud of themselves.
I love my son more than anything. I will do whatever it takes to make sure he is raised the right way.
