American,Actress
I'm definitely happy with the progression of my career. I'm glad I didn't jump to stardom immediately, because I get to enjoy the ride and the chase. Because nothing came easy, I really appreciate it when I book roles.
When I was seven, I gave a letter to Cinderella in Disney World asking if I could be in a Disney movie. So, working for Disney was really a childhood dream come true.
Playing Chelsea on 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody' really helped with my over-the-top comedy.
Meryl Streep is my favorite actor. She is so classy and a brilliant actress. Her performance in 'Sophie's Choice' just kills me.
