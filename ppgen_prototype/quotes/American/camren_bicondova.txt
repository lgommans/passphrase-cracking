I think it's weird seeing myself on the television, but it's great!
I love all animals. I just happen to prefer cats. They're really chill, and they're loving yet not loving. I relate to them, in a way.
Honestly, I wasn't familiar with the whole DC comics world and the Batman world before I was part of 'Gotham.'
I personally like to talk to people when I'm not doing a scene, still acting as if I'm in Gotham when I'm on set because I don't really like to break character, since I sometimes get distracted. I may get distracted when I'm talking to people and having fun; then I have to check myself.
I've always wanted to act; I just didn't know how to get into it. It kind of just happened. Dance brought me into it.
I love New York. I can walk half a block and I'm at the grocery store. I don't have to drive anywhere.
Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, sushi, I love it all. Put it on a plate, and as long as I know what it is, I will eat it.
My mom says I either have to go to college or go into the military.
I always thought it would be cool to go to the island of misfit toys.
The best gift I've ever gotten... My grandpa gave me a Polaroid camera when I was younger. It was awesome!
