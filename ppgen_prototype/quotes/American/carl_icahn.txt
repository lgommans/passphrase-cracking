American,Businessman
You learn in this business: It you want a friend, get a dog.
In 2008, people who invested in hedge funds needed capital badly, but many of the funds would not return their money. However, I gave money back to any investor who requested it. It was the bottom of the market and a pretty tough time.
When you have no one to answer to, vendetta as investment strategy is as legitimate as anything.
Anyone that makes me a quarter of a billion dollars, I like.
I'm a cynic about corporate democracy and boards.
My wife watches me like a hawk.
Don't go in and tell somebody else how to run their business.
I like winning. There's also a certain joy in it. I feel fulfilled by it.
I enjoy the hunt much more than the 'good life' after the victory.
