Well, c'mon, everyone is a Facebook addict!
I've always wanted to be able to hold my breath for like, ever, and swim in the water like a fish.
I hate meeting my favorite bands because then it just ruins it.
I had one drama teacher who was amazing, Ms. Perkins. She really tried to inspire me and get me going.
Growing up with my dad, whenever I wanted to try something, he would let me try it but he wouldn't let me give up on it. If soccer was too tough and I said, 'I'm going to quit,' he'd be like, 'No, you're going to try everything and keep going at it.'
I think that boy bands as a whole are really coming back.
Here's the thing, back in the day, a lot of guys would make fun of me, that I would sing and dance, that I was a cheerleader. But I kept my head on straight. I had goals.
I was 13 and at summer camp when I had my first kiss.
I love everything to be organized and clean... all the time.
