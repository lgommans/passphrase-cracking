Everything you do to other people affects them, and how you treat people affects them.
I miss CDs. I miss listening to a whole album, even the lame songs that sometimes grow on you.
I think that being bullied is a shameful experience.
Prior to being bullied, I was a very footloose sixth-grader. You know, I was quirky, I was creative - I really felt good in my own body. And when I was bullied in seventh grade, my self-esteem tanked.
My own experience being bullied - it made me a more compassionate person. It made me more sympathetic to the adolescent experience.
