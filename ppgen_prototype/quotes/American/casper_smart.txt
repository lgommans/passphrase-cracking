Honestly, I like someone who is really grounded, super sweet, honest. I need them to have a sense of humor. I need them to laugh at what's funny, I need them to get jokes and be funny and be witty and sarcastic.
Freshman year, I was 95 pounds and 4 feet 10 inches. So you can imagine what my football uniform looked like - my shoulder pads were bigger than my body!
I was into everything athletic. I played football. I ran track for a long time. I played basketball every day at home with my friends.
