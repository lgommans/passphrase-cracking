American,Musician
Being black, I'm involved in the reparations movement. It's focused toward the African-American audience. We could begin to heal.
Miles Davis was a master. In every phase of his career, he understood that this music was a tribute to the African muse.
I'm always looking for ways to develop as an artist, especially as a jazz artist-to find different ways of testing my voice.
Miles Davis was doing something inherently African, something that has to do with all forms of American music, not just jazz.
There was a train that would come by our house every night, and I'd hear the whistle blow. That is the sweetest memory I have.
I'm always imagining some sort of story behind the song, even the ones I haven't written. I'm actively engaging in playacting.
My grandmother sang, too, and she was really loud. It was this wild kind of singing. I count her among my influences.
I was never interested in singing in the church choir or in school. I was more interested in becoming a musician.
My father had all kinds of instruments in the house that he would hide from my mother. He bought them through mail order!
Everything I do is collaborative. It's just my way. I'm really very interested in how the other musicians perceive the song.
I've often cringed when I heard myself described as a jazz singer. I've always thought of myself as a jazz vocalist.
