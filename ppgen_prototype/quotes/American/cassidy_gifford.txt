Honestly, my favorite part of the day was going to play practice.
I talk to my mom like any other kid talks to their mom when they live across the country. You call home and check in about what you ate for your breakfast or if I went for a run that day or if I was in a fight with my friend. It's so normal.
Very few people are blessed enough to call their father a legend, and an even smaller number are able to share that notion with the rest of the world.
Philippians 4:13 has never rung so true... You were an unparalleled Giant in all sense of the word, Dad. So keep doin' you up there, because no one does it better, and no one ever will.
When I was younger, people kept making offers for different reality shows and stuff.
