American,Musician
If you take the creation of music and the creation of your own life values as your overall goal, then living becomes a musical process.
Rhythm is the life of space of time danced through.
You must surrender whatever preconceptions you have about music if you're really interested in it.
I discovered very early that it wasn't quite enough for me to imitate people.
To me, the piano in itself is an orchestra.
The quality of life, values that go down to doin' that, that's the issue.
I understand about the relative strengths of people, and I don't think people have to be anything. They can be nothin' if they want to be.
