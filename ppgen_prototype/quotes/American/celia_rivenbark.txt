Sometimes, at parties, people demand I tell a joke. It's like pointing a gun at my feet and telling me to dance.
I don't have a college degree. I started working at 19 on a tiny newspaper. I've covered everything from weddings to crime to criminal weddings.
Writing humor is not something every single person can do.
