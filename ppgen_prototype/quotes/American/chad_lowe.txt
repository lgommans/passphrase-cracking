American,Actor
Actually, every time I am back in New York, I read for as many plays as I can.
I did this role in Life Goes On as an HIV positive character and so emotionally that was the most challenging.
Oh absolutely. I had the pleasure to get to know a lot of really talented young actors before they even really hit it big. And yet what we all had and shared in common was a love for movies.
I think each role has had different challenges.
I think every actor should go back and do theater periodically.
I believe that the story is the most important element of any medium whether it's theater, film, TV.
So ultimately I am looking for a story that has some value and is important and is entertaining.
