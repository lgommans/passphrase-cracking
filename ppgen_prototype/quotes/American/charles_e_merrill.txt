Mr. Ware has no right to discharge any of his laborers on account of their political opinion.
If the planters carry politics into the fields they will find it bad business.
If Mr. Ware does not want republican laborers on his plantation, let him pay them in full for the time contracted for, and they will leave his plantation at once.
If he wants their labor, let them go to work, without regard to politics.
