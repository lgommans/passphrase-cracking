When you do a movie, you go to the location and get into your costume. It's part of your metamorphosis into your character, and it just made sense to do it.
A dream project is anything I do when I'm awake.
In addition to my comedic sensibilities, I also have a love of science. I think that it would be nice if, by the time we're doing the next version of 'Roger Rabbit,' it would be nice if I was receiving my Nobel prize the same week.
I'm a big technology individual. I love science and technology, and anything that has to do with capturing events so that they can be experienced later.
When you are an artist, you want your audience to think it's effortless and easy.
Robert Zemeckis is a genius filmmaker who is an amazing individual. I feel really blessed that I've gotten to work with him on many different occasions.
I'm a huge fan of animation, and just the arts in general - anything that emanates from someone's mind and soul and is capable of touching other people's minds and souls.
