To Paradise, the Arabs say, Satan could never find the way Until the peacock led him in.
It was the noise Of ancient trees falling while all was still Before the storm, in the long interval Between the gathering clouds and that light breeze Which Germans call the Wind's bride.
They saw a Dream of Loveliness descending from the train.
The brave deserve the lovely - every woman may be won.
