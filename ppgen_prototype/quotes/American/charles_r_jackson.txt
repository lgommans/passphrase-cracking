American,Author
The writer knows his own worth, and to be overvalued can confuse and destroy him as an artist.
I am beginning to loathe & detest all that Hollywood represents.
I have become so used to having people say, 'We loved your movie' instead of 'We read your book' that now I merely say, 'Thanks.'
