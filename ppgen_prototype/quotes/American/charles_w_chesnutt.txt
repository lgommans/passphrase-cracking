Those that set in motion the forces of evil cannot always control them afterwards.
There's time enough, but none to spare.
Impossibilities are merely things of which we have not learned, or which we do not wish to happen.
As man sows, so shall he reap. In works of fiction, such men are sometimes converted. More often, in real life, they do not change their natures until they are converted into dust.
Sins, like chickens, come home to roost.
