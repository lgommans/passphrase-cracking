A person should design the way he makes a living around how he wishes to make a life.
We would play, then they would play a set, then we would jam on the last song.
That jam was so much fun that by the end of the tour, we just jammed on all of the songs.
Music's not like becoming a doctor, who can walk into a community and find people who need him.
A musician has to find a way to make his music mean something special - spiritually or however you can.
And a musician has to learn to be frugal and to carefully manage financial affairs.
The guitar chose me.
