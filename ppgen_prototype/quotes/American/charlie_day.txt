American,Actor
Knowing that I'm not a model and I'm never going to be has relieved me of the pressure of looking good. If you don't establish yourself as McDreamy then you don't have to live up to it.
Both of my parents are actually music teachers.
Well, you know, I don't think anyone who writes a television series has a master plan from the beginning, and knows all the character traits, and everything that's going to happen.
The idea of doing stand-up is terrifying to me.
Still when I go on talk shows, I worry that I have to live up to a comedic persona.
As an actor, sometimes you feel a pressure to change yourself from time to time.
Actors put ourselves in awkward positions all the time.
I waited tables in New York, and when you're in that line of work, you often have a horrible boss.
I never saw myself as a comedian. I saw myself as a guy who can act funny.
Starting out, I bet I didn't get a lot of parts because of my strange voice. I'm not consciously thinking, 'Hey, sound like a squeaky dog toy mixed with a bagful of rusty nails.' It's just what my voice has done.
My parents are more likely to know who Franz Liszt is than Snooki.
Thinking of Plan B muddies up your chances of succeeding at Plan A.
Technically, I'm a New Yorker.
Growing up in Rhode Island, my friends would have strung me up if I had been a Yankees fan.
I am a Patsy Cline fan.
Yeah, I've always considered myself a musical person.
