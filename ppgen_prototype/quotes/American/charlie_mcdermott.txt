American,Actor
I can be very lazy sometimes. Really lethargic!
I didn't like school. I was pretty much daydreaming all the time. I would be in the back of the class writing down random stories and stuff that would have nothing to do with school. I only lasted two years in high school before I moved out to L.A.
I was never really a child actor. I was working sporadically in indie films in Pennsylvania, but I was still living at home.
