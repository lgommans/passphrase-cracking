American,Musician
At first I didn't dig country.
As a matter of fact, we put it down because we wanted to be jazz pickers.
I had to make a drastic change at Sun Records and I didn't really appreciate country music until I went there.
I think a guy who's had just the right amount of booze can sing the blues a hell of a lot better than a guy who is stone sober.
