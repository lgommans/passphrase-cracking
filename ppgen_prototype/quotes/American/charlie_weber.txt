American,Actor
I think its naive to think you can push yourself as hard as someone else can push you, but I work really hard on my own. I know my body.
I love going to work.
I'd like to think I'm a good guy as I've gotten older.
I'm not going to say that a very young Charlie Weber is without his indiscretions. But not anymore; I'm way past those days.
As an actor, you're always changing.
I lift weights and do as much cardio as I can make myself. I'm not a big cardio fan, and I hate doing legs.
