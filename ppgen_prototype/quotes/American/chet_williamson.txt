Publishers love to compartmentalize, and 'Second Chance' was not an easy novel to define.
Writing a novel that crosses genres is a risk, but one well worth taking.
When I read a book, I like to be surprised. I don't want to read the same genre formula that I've read a hundred times before.
If I had stayed purely a horror writer or thriller writer, I might have more of a presence in those particular genres, and I'd certainly have more individual titles to market, since it's much easier to write pure genre fiction than it is to create something different.
