Unfortunately, I suffer from insomnia, so my bedtime is as soon as I start to feel the least bit sleepy.
I'm a New Yorker; my oven is used for storage.
Believe it or not, my best meal is to go to the store and buy a DiGiorno pizza, come home, add some fresh Parmesan cheese, and just hang with my family!
I don't like to watch myself. I can't get into the story; I'm too critical.
I always wanted to be on a great TV show and in a Broadway show and have a CD out, and the fact that they happened simultaneously is kind of an embarrassment of riches.
'30 Rock' is the holy grail of comedy in my opinion.
I love 'Glee.'
The devastating repercussions of hate-filled language manifest in very real ways for today's LGBTQ youth.
I'd love for people to accept me just as me, but I know that I generate a strong response; I always have - my name, my looks, my size.
People either love me or they think I'm obnoxious. I get that.
I'm a Broadway baby, through and through. It's my first love, and it's what brought me to New York in the first place.
Theater dressing rooms are my home away from home - my second home, really.
I think having a dog makes you more compassionate.
