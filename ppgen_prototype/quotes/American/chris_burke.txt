American,Actor
I have a motto on my bedroom wall: 'Obstacles are what you see when you take your eye off the goal.' Giving up is not my style. I just want to do something that's worthwhile.
To have my fan club. I am very proud of doing everything. I try to support my parents, friends and fans. I am also proud of my performing in the visual arts, and motion television.
Being a son, brother, uncle and brother-in-law is all I care about.
Having Down syndrome is like being born normal. I am just like you and you are just like me. We are all born in different ways, that is the way I can describe it. I have a normal life.
I don't really have Down's syndrome; I just have a slight case of it.
It's not our disabilities, it's our abilities that count.
Don't give up on the child. Give the child an education. Give them daily love.
I want to do theater and I am looking forward to doing more Television and Movies. I also want to direct some plays in theater workshops for people with disabilities.
I was like Gene Kelly, it was called singing in the rain. No seriously, I wasn't really born with a singing voice, but my friends Joe and John taught me how to sing.
I'd like to be the role model to teach other people who have Down's syndrome to be actors and actresses and to be themselves and not try to be a big shot.
I just want to be like other people that are normal.
I don't like to be different; I would like to be the same.
I'm just like James Stewart, because I never studied to be an actor.
I want to be a professional.
I could make a difference.
