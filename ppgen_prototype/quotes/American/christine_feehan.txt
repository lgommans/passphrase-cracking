American,Writer
My camping days are over, but I might consider glamping.
I write for the love of writing. If I never published another book, I would still be writing stories.
I live on the beautiful Northern California coast. I have always loved hiking, whale watching and being outdoors.
I am surrounded by my family, my beloved grandchildren, and my pack of dogs.
