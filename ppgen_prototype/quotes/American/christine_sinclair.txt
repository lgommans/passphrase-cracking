When I was growing up, you didn't know there was a women's national team. Now girls grow up dreaming of playing for Canada.
I think the thing that has sort of always separated me, even from when I was younger, is my ability to score goals.
I think a lot of people thought women's soccer had arrived and it was here to stay and it was going to be huge, but that wasn't realistic. It has progressed slowly.
I have a Pomeranian dog named Nutmeg - a combination of the soccer move and the colour. It's perfect.
