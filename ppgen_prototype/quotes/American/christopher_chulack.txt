'Southland' is very real; it's not about who found the hair in the bed. There are procedural aspects to it, but it's not about that.
I wanted 'Southland' to feel immediate, like a ride-along, and to make it the closest thing possible to a cop reality show. We've got real cops out there every day. A lot of times we'll say, 'You guys just do what you normally do and we'll film it.'
