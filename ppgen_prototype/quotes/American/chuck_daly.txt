The important thing is to get the right players on the team so Mike can be successful.
There's nothing like being involved with a team that can go that distance.
I've had too lengthy a career and coached too many players to make a choice.
To some degree. I know I couldn't do it anymore.
Though I'd have to say it was generally the guys in Detroit, as a group, that won the two Championships. They were terrific and I always look back very fondly.
The two championship years were that significant for me.
If you're going to have to beg them to play, it's not going to work.
I think the Pistons have such a well rounded team, which is why they're so successful. All you have to do is look at the stats defensively and at their rebounding and scoring.
I do some broadcasting and speaking as well.
