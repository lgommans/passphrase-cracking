American,Politician
I'm going to disappear again.
I'd have to acknowledge that I have a weakness for the fairer sex - and I hope I never get over it.
I am clearly vulnerable on the question of socializing under circumstances not appropriate for a married man.
I made more decisions in a half-day as governor than you can make in a whole week in the Senate... it's too slow for me.
