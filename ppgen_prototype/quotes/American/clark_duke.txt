I'm a big fan of matching outfits in general.
I tend to be conversational and loose with dialogue in general, not out of disrespect for the source material but because that's the way I work.
I go to ComicCon every year, but it's in a work capacity. I'm a legitimate fan of comics, and I have been since I was 5.
People seem to sometimes have a difficulty drawing that line between the character and the person.
A good script makes our job a lot easier.
I actually was raised Baptist. I'm from the South, so you definitely know a lot of conservative people.
I think me and Kristen Bell are going to start a band. It's called Kung-Fu Professor.
I have a huge costume section in my closet - wigs, mustaches, the whole thing. Halloween's my favorite holiday, so I have a lot of weird stuff.
