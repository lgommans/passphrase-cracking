American,Actress
And I usually use myself as a model, posing in front of a mirror as I dab the strokes on the canvas.
They seem to be charmed by my Southern accent.
Believe it or not, I was all fully rounded by the time I was nine years old.
It was strange what happened to me; I mean popping out like that before I was even ten.
Anything I learned about the fine art of acting I learned from Hugo.
We made one film called Thy Neighbor's Wife in which I got flogged at the public whipping post for adultery. I did my best acting in that film, I guess.
I like to take afternoon naps in the nude.
I'm not a very good painter, but I'm learning a lot.
I like to paint nudes mostly.
Painting self-portraits without clothes on has also given me some publicity.
One newspaper even published one of my nude paintings - the one of me naked from the waste up.
None of the European girls, including Anita Ekberg, has anything not found on American girls as well.
They want a lip print for their autograph books. I'm a sport; I go along.
You know, just because you're a blonde type doesn't mean you can't suddenly do serious parts.
Tell me the truth - do you think I've lost my Southern accent? I feel it comes back to me only when I'm shouting at fights or at baseball games.
