The most valuable thing that anyone will ever give you is their time. Not their money. Remember that.
Making films is hard. Awesome, but hard.
If you have to, take a break, go to your corner, get some sleep, but don't ever give up. You will get there.
Be careful what you wish for because you will get it. Be even more careful what you work for because you will get it even more quickly.
I look forward to every script that comes down the pike.
I just want to see a good movie. Fortunately, good movies come in all sorts of genres.
I'm blessed and proud and privileged to have played two wonderful characters on television.
