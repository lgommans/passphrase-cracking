All these years, I found that being a good wife for Jeb is my most important role, no doubt.
My children are the most important thing in my life.
My father-in-law is so sensitive. Sometimes I think he displays too much love for my children.
I never imagined my life would be the way that it has been for the past 30 years. I have had the best experiences a person can have-and the worst as well.
I met Jeb Bush in 1971 in my hometown in Mexico. We dated for three years back and forth. Then, after three years, he proposed to me.
My childhood, I would say, was a bit sad.
I love the arts.
My philosophy in life... is to prove myself to myself and not to others. I tried to teach my children that, that I have to respect myself, to prove to myself that I can do the best I can.
My childhood, I would say, was a bit sad. Society resents that.
My heart was broken when I realized my daughter had a problem. I pray every day for her.
I have three wonderful children. My husband is an absolutely wonderful, perfect husband and a father, most of all.
My children were born into this. They will always be the grandchildren of the President and First Lady of the United States.
I always have been a private person. I like to be alone. When I was a little girl I used to listen to the radio and just be by myself.
I am not interested in politics at all. At home, around the dinner table, we never discuss politics.
