Everybody who knows me is like, 'Dude, you've got to chill out.' I can't not work, given where I want to be.
I can say with full sincerity that I am happy. I'm happy because I'm doing what I love and I'm not selling out.
With films, you completely immerse yourself in a character, get into who they are, live it and then release it.
I just can't relax. That's my problem.
I want to play Martin Luther King. That is absolutely a role and a character who is important to the landscape of the world that I really want to play.
You've got to be honest with yourself aesthetically about who could you play. You want to artistically be true to that character.
I think showing heroes as fallible helps us and reminds us that we are ourselves fallible and no man is perfect but we can still achieve great things.
