American,Actor
I didn't start acting until after undergrad!
I randomly took an acting class in undergrad and was reading a monologue from 'Lemon Sky' by Lanford Wilson, and I felt such a connection to the material and then to the audience as I was doing it. This electric current ran through the author, me and the audience, and I felt connected in a way that rarely happens. I was hooked.
I own all 7 seasons of 'The Golden Girls.'
I created and opened a student-run coffeehouse in undergrad, and I loved it. I'd want to do that in the West Village.
The mistake people that want to be actors make is to move to New York or L.A. right away. But it's like... go act somewhere first. Be an actor. A story is a story, and an audience is an audience, no matter where you're doing it.
You learn more about yourself in intimate relationships than any other endeavor. I can go do 'King and I' and sing out in front of 1,000-plus people, but trying to open up about something that's bothering me with somebody that I'm in a relationship with? That's the scariest thing.
