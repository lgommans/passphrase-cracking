I have this obsession with really cool, old books.
I think any time someone's dreams are crushed, there's the people who can fight to still try and fulfill those dreams and then there's the people who just give up.
I think the best thing that you can do with your kids is to talk to them like they're human beings, not like they're children and they don't know what they're doing.
On my first day on the set of 'Boston Legal,' I thought the director was calling me 'Candice' instead of 'Constance.' But I didn't realize he was actually talking to Candice Bergen.
I'm kind of a 'Daily Show,' Bill Maher junkie. I listen to NPR and I still get the 'New York Times' paper delivered to my door, even though I live in L.A.
I would be terrified if Bill Maher was like, 'Hey, do you want to come on the show?' I would be like, 'Oh, God.' It would completely terrify me, even though I'm such a junkie for the show.
I think I brush the surface of being involved politically with the issues and the personalities in the news.
In politics, they play games. In Hollywood, they play games. I think that, overall, everybody is trying to do whatever it takes to get ahead.
Everybody always thinks I'm a lesbian because I'm a very tough broad. I have a lot of lesbian fans.
You can't really compare any TV show to a show written by Aaron Sorkin.
I'm much nicer then all my characters, let's just put it that way.
I definitely learned about the inner workings of campaigns enough to know that I'm glad that I'm not in politics.
