American,Actor
The thing is that, often if you have time to research a role, sometimes it's hard to know exactly where to start.
People say the 'Lost Generation' in a romantic sense, but I think it was tragic. They were really lost.
I think part of being masculine is not needing to prove it and not needing to answer for it.
It's funny; I'm in some ways hopelessly masculine, but I don't fish, I don't hunt, I'm not that into sports. I can't fix a car. I think it's my point of view and the way I see the world.
I can walk down the street and nobody knows who I am.
I don't feel secure at all. I don't know what actor would feel they've made it. I feel like I'm just starting.
I'm an actor, in particular, that likes to have a mask or something that can help me distance myself from the character. Like the moustache or an accent.
Yes, I'm a New Yorker, born and bred. While I'm not quite the L.A. snob that Woody Allen is, I do find myself happier in New York.
In terms of my free time, I really don't have much. The time I do have, I enjoy being domestic and spending time with my girlfriend, hiking and playing tennis.
There's a ton of stories that can come out of L.A. I actually think that even though I enjoy being in New York more, I think that L.A. is a really fascinating place.
