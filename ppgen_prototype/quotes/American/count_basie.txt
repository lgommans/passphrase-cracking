I'm saying: to be continued, until we meet again. Meanwhile, keep on listening and tapping your feet.
I, of course, wanted to play real jazz. When we played pop tunes, and naturally we had to, I wanted those pops to kick! Not loud and fast, understand, but smoothly and with a definite punch.
If you play a tune and a person don't tap their feet, don't play the tune.
All I wanted was to be big, to be in show business and to travel... and that's what I've been doing all my life.
Of course, there are a lot of ways you can treat the blues, but it will still be the blues.
Well, if you find a note tonight that sounds good, play the same damn note every night!
I decided that I would be one of the biggest new names; and I actually had some little fancy business cards printed up to announce it, 'Count Basie. Beware, the Count is Here.'
