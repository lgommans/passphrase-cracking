Some of the best lessons we ever learn are learned from past mistakes. The error of the past is the wisdom and success of the future.
It is the highest form of self-respect to admit our errors and mistakes and make amends for them. To make a mistake is only an error in judgment, but to adhere to it when it is discovered shows infirmity of character.
People who make no mistakes lack boldness and the spirit of adventure. They are the brakes on the wheels of progress.
The test is to recognize the mistake, admit it and correct it. To have tried to do something and failed is vastly better than to have tried to do nothing and succeeded.
Because everything we say and do is the length and shadow of our own souls, our influence is determined by the quality of our being.
