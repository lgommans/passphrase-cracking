This town was built on nepotism.
My father is a Jehovah's Witness, and he raised us under a very strict hand.
The show has become my therapy.
We have four beautiful children and some wonderful memories.
I was 12 years old when I had my first job, delivering packages.

And my marriage was perfect when I wasn't famous.
My kids have a competitive drive I never had growing up.
I never thought about being famous.
But my kids, my brothers' kids - they think about trying to top what we did.
