The main thing I want to do is make people feel more connected and more active.
What's completely insane to me is that people would consider music that's simple to be dumbed-down. Couldn't simplicity be a deliberate, smart choice?
You know, most people called rap stupid when it started, and it was one of the most innovative music forms of its time.
When I went to school, it was really just to immerse myself in listening to, studying, and making music.
If you've become a huge act and you're still doing the same music you wrote with your friends when you were making zero dollars, you're lazy.
It was never the goal to be a solo performer. It was just something that made the most sense at the time.
I just wanted to make a record that wasn't escapism. Like, I didn't want to write another record that was devoid of meaningful content.
I wanted to start working on something that had a lasting effect.
For the last three years, I've been working on 'Bromst,' and that's all that encompassed my brain. And now that it's out, it will change the way that I think musically.
I need to start honing in on projects that I want to devote my time to and not put my energies into the unattainable ones.
I've since become really good at overwhelming myself.
I throw ideas out into the open when I really should just be writing them down in a journal.
