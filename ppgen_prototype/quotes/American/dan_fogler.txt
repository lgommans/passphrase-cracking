American,Comedian
My brother and I, we were both relatively good-looking guys growing up, but we had our awkward stages, where we were just hard to look at.
If you're not a beautiful person, you can't do anything about it.
After I won the Tony Award, the film floodgates opened, so I was like a kid in a candy store.
I grew up in the '80s. I was a kid, but all my favorite movies came out of that period.
Well, I think a lot of people just want to be famous.
I love theater. I grew up doing theater.
I'm a good audience in general, but it's hard to make me laugh.
I've always been creating my whole life, you know. I've just had a need to create, whether it was sculpting or writing or directing. It's just ever since I was a kid, I don't know.
When I was a kid, I would make kung fu movies with the kids in the neighborhood, and I would be the guy behind the camera directing everybody, but they were all very silly little shorts and comedy bits.
I'm from New York, so I'm not a big driver.
I used to have this fantasy when I was growing up where Princess Leia would be in the slave Leia costume and she would be in a vat of Breyer's ice cream. A recurring dream where I would eat my way to her.
My brain doesn't like to be quiet.
When I was on Broadway, people would really just recognize me around the theater. When you're showing up on commercials and posters, the scope of people recognizing you gets a little wider.
In 20 years I want to look back and see a collection of crazy characters that I made - a menagerie.
