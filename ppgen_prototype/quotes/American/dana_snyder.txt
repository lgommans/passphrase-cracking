American,Actor
I was not put on this earth to listen to meat!
The Highlander was a documentary, and events happened in real time.
I love being a part of Aqua Teen.
My primary interest has always been about exploring the human psyche and humanity.
I know a lot about Jewish comedians.
I'm greedy, and I have a house to pay for and a wife. She has a job of her own, but I bleed her dry. She's on her third shift right now.
I know, logically, about the fact that there are fans of my work in America, but it's hard for that feeling to sink in.
I just find 'Scooby-Doo' unwatchable. I can't stand it. I like all those other Hanna-Barbera shows about a thousand times more than 'Scooby-Doo.'
The only rule is there's only one rule: no rules.
I graduated from the University of Whatever.
