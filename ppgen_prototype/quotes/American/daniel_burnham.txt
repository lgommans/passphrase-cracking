American,Architect
Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized.
Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence.
Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.
It was Chicago with its World's Fair which vivified the national desire for civic beauty.
Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us.
