A performer needs to feel the part to be the part!
I love Halloween! I love it so much that I used to work at a haunted house every year.
As a kid, I loved leading 'dance camp' in my garage for the neighborhood kids. I would choreograph really intricate routines for us to perform. It was so much fun!
Growing up, I absolutely loved skateboarding and dirt bike riding with my brother and the neighborhood kids.
I am really close to my family. My cousin is my best friend!
I grew up doing a lot of extreme sports.
I hung out with all the guys in my neighborhood when I was little... I would, like, skateboard and go to skate parks, like, every day and do motor cross, like, every weekend, and I was kind of one of those girls.
