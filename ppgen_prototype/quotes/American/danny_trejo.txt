American,Actor
Everything good that's ever happened to me came out of helping others.
Hollywood wants guys who can act tough - Hollywood don't want tough guys.
I'd always rather be working - and you know what? My kids would rather me be working. If I stay at home, I'll only buy another car or spend their money.
I love action films. I don't really like drama.
The blessing that this film business has given me is that when I walk into a school I automatically have everyone's attention. They want to hear what the guy from 'Con Air' and 'Desperado' has to say.
