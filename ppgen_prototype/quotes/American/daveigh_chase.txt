American,Actress
I pay for what I call eccentricity and my will to evolve.
I just want to make something that I love and people will respect.
I want to do things that will change someone's life, not something they'll forget about tomorrow.
I like dark, dramatic roles; they're just really powerful and real.
I loved working on 'Donnie Darko.' I learned a lot from the cast, Jake Gyllenhaal and the producers. I love doing what I do because I get to meet so many great people.
I'd love to star in dark drama that audiences could really relate to.
