American,Actor
I was a poor kid. I came from nothing. We didn't have any money; a lot of times we didn't have any food, and now, all of a sudden, I'm a superhero in a Marvel movie? Talk about the American dream, man - I'm living it.
People look at me, and they have a certain perception, and they slap a label on me. The guy you saw in a wrestling ring is not who I am.
I don't watch my playbacks because I hate to see myself act.
Nothing can motivate me any more than I'm already motivated. It just can't happen. Me being motivated was never a factor. Never.
'Smallville' gig was another one of those things I got through WWE. At that point, I had absolutely no aspirations to pursue acting.
I'm particular about the projects that I've chosen. Each one of them, I've taken a step up, like climbing a ladder. Before, it was baby-steps, up to 'Riddick.' Then I took this huge leap onto 'Guardians!' It was such a higher level, this huge project which originally I never thought I'd have a chance in hell of getting.
I'm still learning and trying to become a better actor. I still feel insecurity.
Sometimes it's hard to get people to take me seriously as an actor when they just see me as this WWE muscle head.
The pressure is always stepping on stage with actors who are just so well-established. It's a scary thing. I haven't been around the block that many times, especially not on big projects. Dialogue makes things easier. When you start bouncing dialogue off of other actors, it becomes comfortable; it becomes conversational.
