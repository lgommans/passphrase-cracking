American,Actor
Red hair stigmatizes you.
I went from a guy, kind of a working actor, a supporting player, to magazine covers and being offered the studio pictures really quickly. Nobody was comfortable with it. I wasn't really comfortable with it.
It really comes down to the fact that, because I was perceived as a bad guy for leaving the show, I think people were rooting against the movies. That was really unfortunate.
Not to sound too pathetic, but there have been long stretches where I haven't been able to get a job.
Television, as you know, can kind of jettison you into a whole new world.
Having a little boy has taken me to a very deep place. I am starting to realize everything I ever worried about was such a waste of time.
In Hollywood, if you have any success, you have this fear: What do you have to do to hang onto it?
I learned that unemployment can be the great educator.
Any story you've heard of my behavior is probably true.
My visibility may have gotten Hollywood to redefine what's attractive.
Women are not totally nauseous after seeing me.
Miami is one of the great cultural melting pots in the world. I love working and living here.
If you're not willing to risk, there are no rewards.
I was a guy who abandoned a TV show. I didn't care about people.
It's taken me a long time to get back into the industry. People were not really open to me working, or being a part of the industry.
