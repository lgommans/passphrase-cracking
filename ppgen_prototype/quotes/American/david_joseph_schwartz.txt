American,Businessman
Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success.
How we think shows through in how we act. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. They reflect thinking.
The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do.
To fight fear, act. To increase fear - wait, put off postpone.
There is a good side to every situation.
Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.
Look at things... as they can be.
Do what you fear and fear disappears.
In the large cities that received new Americans, there flowered a golden age of restaurants, manned by the available talent from abroad and fueled by the restless wealth of the newly rich.
