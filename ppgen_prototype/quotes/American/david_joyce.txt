American,Politician
I have two measures every time I look at a bill. Is this in the best interests of the hardworking taxpayers in Northeast Ohio and the 14th District, and will this stimulate or encourage the economy to work?
I like to think of myself as my own guy. I don't want to be labeled as a Tea Party guy, but I'm not necessarily against their agenda.
