The way you present a stunt is tied in to the way you photograph it, so you're hanging out with the cinematographer.
As a stunt guy, you become a mini-director. You're talking to actors about performance.
You learn tricks to make action look more dynamic - having the fight come toward you or shooting on a longer lens to compress the speed.
While filming 'The Matrix,' we studied how a Chinese fight-choreography team trains actors before production starts so that they can participate in action sequences in a more dynamic way.
People have given their lives to this industry to make movies compelling.
Film is a collaborative art form. I don't know why you wouldn't recognize the stunt performers.
Stunt coordinating is a good training ground for directing because you have exposure to all the departments in film.
There's a lot of directing within the stunt coordinator's job.
