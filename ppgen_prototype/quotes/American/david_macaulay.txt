I went back to the notion of story, which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
I'm a big fan of the digestive system.
If you are lucky enough to be successful, you get drawn further in and you stop paying attention to the stuff that matters.
I'm just looking for projects I enjoy.
I've never thought about the ages of my readers.
Making books is hard work. Some books are, of course, more demanding than others.
Occasionally, I just need to escape from my work or be reminded of the comparative bliss of my own life, so I pick up a novel.
