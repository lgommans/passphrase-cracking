American,Politician
The work is challenging, interesting and an important part of our legal system.
I continued to serve in Congress until 2001.
I appreciate the opportunity to continue to serve the people of our state.
After 16 months of teaching, consulting, fellowship, and special project activities on matters ranging from conservation to healthcare to international trade, Gov. Ventura appointed me to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
