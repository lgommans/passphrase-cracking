American,Actor
We lived and breathed acting.
I wanted to go to Rome. I got an offer to do an Italian film and I went.
I went to the London Academy Of Music and Dramatic Art and returned to New York where I started my career.
As a student in London, I had seen so many shows, so many plays and had seen so many greats of the day.
You need help when you're starting out. On the other hand, some people are very naturalistic to begin with.
I was not prepared for the actual process itself; having to go to the shop and having some molds done.
Well, I realized finally that all of the hard work paid off.
I'm not a big slasher film fan.
I always go with the story and character and if those are good and if the setting is something that's scary (horror films seem to always take place at night and the weather's always bad) then I might be interested.
I have, I think to do a play a year is very good if you can afford the time and the energy because it's difficult to do, it's really the actors medium of course, because you're really out there and nobody's yelling cut so, yeah I have.
Musical theatre is something I'm familiar with, I've been doing that.
Comedies are something I'd be very interesting in doing.
