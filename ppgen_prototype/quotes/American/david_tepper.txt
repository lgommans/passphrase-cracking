American,Businessman
I'm just a regular upper-middle-class guy who happens to be a billionaire.
I think when it comes to decisions, I try not to be emotional. To drown out the noise and look at the important facts.
I was never afraid to go back to Pittsburgh and work in the steel mills.
I could buy an island. I could buy a private jet - but I have NetJets.
I left Goldman Sachs. I was thinking about going to another Wall Street place. I didn't want to do that. That was crazy. After you work on Wall Street, it's a choice: would you rather work at McDonald's or on the sell side? I would choose McDonald's over the sell side.
When we started Appaloosa, we were going to name it Pegasus because everyone was using Greek names. We filed the name. We paid $300, and they said you cannot use it because it is taken. Pegasus Funds. Then we said Pegasus is kind of a horse. We did not want to be the Unicorn Fund. So we pulled out a horse book.
