American,Politician
I want to protect and preserve social security and Medicare.
As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, I know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in.
The American people deserve long-term, forward-thinking policies.
Serving in the United States Senate has been the greatest privilege of my life.
I want to talk about jobs, the economy, foreclosures. I want to talk about energy prices.
