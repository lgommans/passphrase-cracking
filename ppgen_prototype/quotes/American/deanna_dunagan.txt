American,Actress
New York is hard for me. I grew up in Texas. I can't do without my car, and you can't have a car in New York.
Coming from West Texas at the time that I did, I didn't know you could be an actor. It didn't seem like something that actually happened.
When I was a little girl, I got 'Time' magazine every week, and I wanted my face on the cover, but I've changed a lot since then.
