American,Actress
I was never an actress in high school. I didn't start acting until I was in my twenties. I was just a funny cheerleader. I hadn't even seen a show until I was in my twenties, so I was very late getting into the business.
My family were really hard-working, blue-collar people, and I didn't know the idea or concept of working and having fun. I thought you just worked and made money to support your family.
I really wait for the job to come. Whatever job comes up, I just want to keep working. The jobs don't always come, so you take whatever is available and hope it's a good one.
