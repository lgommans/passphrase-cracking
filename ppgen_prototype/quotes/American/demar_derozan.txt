If you work for it, you'll deserve what comes. Hard work.
I'm sure there's a long list of one-time all-stars, and I don't want to be on it.
Growing up, I didn't have a lot and always wanted things. But I was too prideful to ask for anything; I always worked for it.
I told myself that if I went to Compton High, and I made something out of the school, it would mean something to me later down the line because I started everything. And future kids would say, 'DeMar made it here; why can't I?' I wanted to stay home.
Me and my mom are just alike in every type of way. I talk to my mom about everything.
My dad always played sports. He played football. I always wanted to play football because my dad played football, but my mom never wanted me to play football because she said she couldn't take me getting hit.
My mom's one of the toughest ladies I know. I've seen her lose both her brothers, both her parents. She's been through a lot, and to see her get up every day and put a smile on her face, that shows nothing but strength.
