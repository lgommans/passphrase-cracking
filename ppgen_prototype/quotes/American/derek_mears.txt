My background is all comedy. I've been doing improv since I was 17. It's funny, because when I meet people, I'm known as this guy who will punch you in the face or throw you out a window, when I also have a background in comedy.
I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues.
In my opinion, what 'The Evil Dead' is to horror, 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is to action-fantasy, with these horror elements and a steampunk-y twist.
I grew up as a fanboy and a giant nerd, and I mean that in the most loving sense. I loved playing 'Dungeons and Dragons.'
