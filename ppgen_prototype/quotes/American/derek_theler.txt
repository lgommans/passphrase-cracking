American,Actor
I'm born in Alaska, grew up in Colorado, went to college in Colorado, went to Colorado State, and I actually finished my degree.
I worked at a daycare for a couple of years going through high school and college. I did youth sports camps. I ran all the camps through my college.
One of my goals is definitely break into film, and I want to do action movies as well.
I'm a huge, huge comic book fan. I love the superhero movies so much. If I had to be one of the Avengers, I would go with Thor. I would have to. I just think I look the part too much, and I'm a fan of all of them, but Thor would be something that I think I could put on. I think I could make it happen.
I'm actually a Type 1 diabetic, so growing up, I had to eat pretty healthy.
I wound up getting my degree in sports medicine and nutrition because I wanted to work in the medical field. But I wound up taking a trip to Los Angeles and decided being an actor sounds pretty cool, too.
I've said this a lot - I'm afraid to have girls! I've worked with kids before, and I just relate to boys better. I like their competitiveness and aggression: that's more my style. I'm still dead set on doing whatever I can to make sure I only have boys!
I'm definitely an outdoorsy guy. I like hiking, outdoor workouts with body weight. But when it comes to getting it done, I can just get in the gym and pound it out.
When I first dropped into L.A., I wanted to be a superhero!
I went to school at Colorado State. I finished my degree in pre-medicine and nutrition with aspirations of actually going to graduate school in medicine, which I didn't.
