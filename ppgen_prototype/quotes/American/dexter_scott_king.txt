Life too is precious to waste - to spend on anything but the best.
People will judge you according to your own convictions.
I'm in a position to look back at my life, and I realized there were a number of experiences that needed to be documented.
The government paid the family of Richard Nixon $18 million for papers, tape recordings and other materials seized after Watergate.
We could in fact transport a person, say a kid who didn't know what it was like to be in a civil rights march. We could actually take you into that experience, so that you could better appreciate what happened and why it happened.
What everybody misses here is that we are doing the same thing my father did. He licensed and litigated and protected his property, and we have to follow the same tradition, because the way the law reads, if you don't protect it, you lose it.
I was a little bit chubby when I was a kid.
