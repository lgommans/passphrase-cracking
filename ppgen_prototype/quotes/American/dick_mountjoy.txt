American,Politician
I'm not a person that just supports an issue; I go out and work for it.
Immigration reform is a must, an amnesty. So that's my position. I've been pushing that one since before it was popular.
I don't think we need political activists on the Supreme Court or any other level of court.
Rank and file Democrats are very patriotic. They love this country and support the military.
We can't deny the financial toll illegal immigrants take on our communities.
