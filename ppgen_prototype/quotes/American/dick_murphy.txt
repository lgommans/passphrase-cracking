American,Politician
You have the biggest impact on controlling, on affecting local lives as mayor. It's so much more important than being a state legislator.
Your first obligation, I suppose, is to your God. Your second is to your family. And your third is to your community. And you ought to try to fulfill all of those in your life.
At least I make decisions based on what I think is right, not who my friends might be.
I'm not going to rule out running for a second term. But, I think you have to be psychologically prepared to walk away from the job after four years. It's the only way that you cannot be influenced by those special interests.
I'm convinced that unless you have some public financing of elections, you are never going to remove the power of wealthy interests over elected officials.
I don't think that politics attracts the best and the brightest of America. It doesn't attract the most sincere people.
My belief is the majority of people in politics are just interested in pursuing this career in politics, and doing what's necessary to get themselves re-elected. And if that happens to coincide with the public good, great. But if it doesn't, the public good loses out.
