When you're down and out, there's no meaner place to live than Hollywood. You can get away with your embezzlements and your lies and your murders, but you can never get away with failing.
For me, the path of failure exceeded by far the joys of success. My plight was hopeless.
Within me, I knew I would never be a first-rate producer. I wasn't tough enough.
I made no pretense of doing balanced reporting about murder. I was appalled by defense attorneys who would do anything to win an acquittal for a guilty person.
I've lived this very dramatic life, with high points and terrible low points. Nothing has been ordinary, and I want to have the experience of the last breath. I want a little drama to it.
I always love going back to Los Angeles, because it was my home for 24 years, and I have many friends there.
My father was this famous heart surgeon, a wonderful man... but there was something about me that drove him crazy.
I had never attended a trial until my daughter's murder trial. What I witnessed in that courtroom enraged and redirected me.
You write about what you have access to, and I have been fortunate enough to have a front-row seat on the rich and powerful my entire life.
For my type of story and my kind of writing, I think 'Vanity Fair' is the right forum.
I think I need pictures with my articles.
I don't understand all about New York society. It's only when they are in trouble that I'm really interested.
