If you don't second-guess yourself, then you are not trying to get better.
We all have the temptation to be backseat drivers when it comes to decisions that don't work out the way we want.
Honestly, at one time I though Babe Ruth was a cartoon character. I really did, I mean I wasn't born until 1961 and I grew up in Indiana.
I'd like to say this was our worst game. Unfortunately, I can't.
The players get no respect around here. They give you money, that's it, not respect. We get constantly dogged and players from other teams love to see that. That's why nobody wants to play here.
I've wanted to manage a long time and I've been moving in that direction.
I'm always writing at night - things I would change, things I would do differently. When I write a note, it sticks in my head differently.
I want to be on the field. It's a better place to talk to the guys. It's a relaxed atmosphere. You want to make sure you know what's going on, not just with the hitters.
Good teams I played on... just the tone that they play with, the energy they play with, how they go about it. When you get it going the right way, you get everyone going in the same direction and it's a powerful thing.
On the playing side, a lot of guys I played under were pretty good managers.
I definitely want to manage. I just don't think it's the time right now.
Nobody can see into the future. Nobody knows what going to go on.
I don't know what to say other than you're really honored another team is looking at you.
I have had many occasions this year where I questioned and second-guessed my decision in a game, but it comes down to learning from mistakes and being accountable for what you did right or did wrong.
Managers have people second-guessing them all the time.
When I write a note, it sticks in my head differently.
I'm not afraid of criticism or what somebody may think.
