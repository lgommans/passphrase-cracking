American,Cartoonist
I think there's a mystery to drawing - to the weight of the lines. The sweep of a line around a corner to create an effect that someone is moving.
I always liked to put on a tie. The more you look like an executive, the better treated you are. It catches people by surprise.
If I were wearing jeans, I'd be wearing the uniform of a cartoonist.
