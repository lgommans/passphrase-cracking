What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle and giving 110 percent all the time.
Hey, it's been a great ride for me, a great life. Everything I have I owe to baseball. Baseball owes me nothin'. Ain't nobody has to give me nothin'. I would be embarrassed if I had a day somewhere. I don't want no day. I want friends, to live my life the way I wanna live it.
Never drew a paycheck outside of baseball.
