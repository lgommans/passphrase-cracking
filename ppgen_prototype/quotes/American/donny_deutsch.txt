American,Businessman
My philosophy is to always find the smartest people you can. Hire people smarter than you.
The only thing I hated about the agency business was a lot of business travel. It was the only part of my job that I did not like. I found it very tedious and wearing.
I don't have a favorite medium; I was brought up on TV. so I am clearly of the TV generation, but it depends on what you are trying to sell; sometimes a fully integrated solution, sometimes a pure Internet solution, sometimes a pure billboard solution.
I am not one of these people who spend a ton of time in front on my computer; I see it as very utilitarian.
I appear wild on the outside, but I'm a conservative businessman.
Changes in my personal life are nerve-racking for me.
