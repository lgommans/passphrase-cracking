Life's a roller coaster, but I feel a change.
I've always been pretty serious and introspective.
That Bears quarterback is no good. He's washed up. He's 30.
I always had a belief in myself, and I started wondering if it was founded.
I was really more interested in dramatic work, but I thought, 'Well, I guess I could do comedy.'
