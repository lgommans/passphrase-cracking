Florenz Ziegfeld, to us and our family, was just a delightful person. My sisters, Mary and Pearl, my brother Charlie and I all worked for him, and he treated us just beautifully, almost like a father. When I went with my mother up to his office, he was always gentlemanly and kindly. He was sort of a quiet person.
With me, it was just a job. I never had stars in my eyes about the theatre.
I was thrilled to be rehired for the 1919 'Follies.' Mr. Ziegfeld himself hired me. To me, that particular 'Follies' was his greatest 'Follies' of all - not because I was in the show, but because of the great cast and memorable music.
