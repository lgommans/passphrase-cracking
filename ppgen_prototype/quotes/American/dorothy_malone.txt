Sinatra asked me out.
I was born in Everett; I went through grade school in Everett, high school in Seattle.
My father was a minister, so I was a P.K., a preacher's kid.
I had had no art training.
I was the first movie star to plunge into night-time soap opera.
Everybody said Peyton Place would be a mistake.
Television wasn't prestigious.
I never turned down a mother role.
I started out as a very young girl in Hollywood doing westerns portraying a mother with a couple of kids.
I was a bridesmaid at a wedding in one picture.
The only thing I did at RKO of any note was lose my Texas accent.
We had cocktail parties and I'd stay up until 5 in the morning.
I loved to get all dusty and ride horses and plant potatoes and cotton.
I get crushes on directors because they are so brilliant.
Sirk was every woman's dream of a director.
I acted three times with Fred MacMurray, three times with Martin and Lewis, four times with Rock Hudson. Three times with Glenn Ford.
