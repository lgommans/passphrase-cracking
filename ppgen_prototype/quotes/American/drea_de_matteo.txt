I like real problems, the human condition - twisted, darker stuff.
I'm tired of the industry, tired of playing the whole game - the dressing up, the red carpet. I hate talking about myself.
I like to make everything my friends are involved in a little better. I should have just become a manager.
If I found the right guy, I think I would get married. Maybe. I just feel like it's just a contract. Why sign any more contracts, really?
I have so much fun with Matt LeBlanc that whether I love it or not really makes no difference to me because I just really have that much fun with him and playing with him. Being onstage with him is great.
I should have just become a manager.
I get super bored playing bland, normal girls.
I'd love to do a 'Sopranos' sequel.
I'm definitely stereotyped, and I'm very okay with that.
