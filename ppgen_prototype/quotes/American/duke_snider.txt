Swing hard, in case they throw the ball where you're swinging.
My high salary for one season was forty-six thousand dollars and a Cadillac.
Man, if I made one million dollars I would come in at six in the morning, sweep the stands, wash the uniforms, clean out the office, manage the team and play the games.
What a player does best, he should practice least. Practice is for problems.
In the split second from the time the ball leaves the pitcher's hand until it reaches the plate you have to think about your stride, your hip action, your wrist action, determine how much, if any the ball is going to break and then decide whether to swing at it.
