I threw my best to every hitter I faced, and I found I had the strength to go all the way.
I remember when I wanted every pitch to be a strike.
Ball parks are smaller and baseballs are livelier. They've practically got pitchers wearing straitjackets. Bah! They still allow the knuckleball, and that is three times as hard to control.
