American,Soldier
Everything happens to me. I've never had a streak of luck in my life.
Honest honey, I feel like crying every time I sit down to write you a letter... I am so unlucky.
I've made up my mind. I'll take my court martial.
Army life don't agree with me.
I am in the infantry for 17 weeks and after that I don't know where I am going.
I think I'm going to have a lot of trouble.
I'm sorry I didn't go to jail for six months, then I know you could come to see me anytime you wanted to.
The only luck I had in my life was when I married you. I knew it wouldn't last because I was too happy. I knew they would not let me be happy.
They're not shooting me for deserting the United Stated Army - thousands of guys have done that. They're shooting me for bread I stole when I was 12 years old.
