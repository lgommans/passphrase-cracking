American,Poet
Fashion is a potency in art, making it hard to judge between the temporary and the lasting.
Poetry is an art, and chief of the fine art; the easiest to dabble in, the hardest in which to reach true excellence.
Yes, there's a luck in most things; and in none more than being born at the right time.
