The introduction of many minds into many fields of learning along a broad spectrum keeps alive questions about the accessibility, if not the unity, of knowledge.
The University conceives of itself as dedicated to the power of the intellect. Its commitment is to the way of reason.
The concept of reason itself appears as an artificial attempt to separate intellectual powers from the frustrations, emotions, and accidents which cause events; the concept of reason is viewed as facade to prevent change.
The role of a liberal arts college within a university is to be a genuine part of that university, giving and responding to the other parts.
Law builds upon and, I should like to claim, is one of the liberal arts. It uses words of persuasion and changing definitions for practical ends.
As an instrument for practical action, law is responsive to the wisdom of its time, which may be wrong, but it carries forward, sometimes in opposition to this wisdom or passion, a memory of received values.
Universities are the custodians not only of the many cultures of man, but of the rational process itself.
