American,Scientist
I remember, in the winter of our first experiments, just seven years ago, looking on snow with new eyes.
To see the world for a moment as something rich and strange is the private reward of many a discovery.
The Nobel Prize, so long regarded in our science as the highest reward a man's work can earn, must bring to its recipient a most solemn sense of his debt to his fellow scientists and those of the past.
