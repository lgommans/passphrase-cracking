American,Actor
I ended up with my life slanted toward television, and I just accept that. I think you play the hand the way it's dealt, that's all.
I walked onstage in a play at prep school, and with childish naivete, told myself, 'Wow, I'm an actor!'
When you learn that you inspired someone, it's a huge honor.
Having been kept pretty strict in prep schools, I guess I couldn't cope with all the freedom at Yale. I had a wild, wonderful time, got abysmal grades and was bounced out in my freshman year. I then came back the following fall as a repeating freshman, lasted until April and got bounced out again - for the same reason.
I'm a conservative Republican.
I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself.
If I would characterize my life, I would say that I was a very lucky actor who came into very lucky times, and got to Hollywood, and was put under contract by Warners in the very last days of the studio contract era, and was privileged to go through that time which is gone now.
