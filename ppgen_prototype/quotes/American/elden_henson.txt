American,Actor
I'm great at fake typing but in real life terrible.
You never want me in a position to have to think. That's bad.
I loved movies, growing up. They brought me so much joy.
I've always wanted to meet Robert Downey, Jr. because I think he's awesome.
If you meet someone on the street that likes something that you did or likes the way you brought this character to life, that's really rewarding. That's really cool.
I know of the Daredevil comic because it's so iconic.
I've been acting a long time. I've been a member of SAG since 1982.
I love the Avengers movies and Iron Man and Captain America.
As an actor, I'm always just so pumped when I get any job. To be a working actor takes a lot of luck.
I'm a movie nerd, and when I'm really looking forward to something coming out, the less I know, the better.
