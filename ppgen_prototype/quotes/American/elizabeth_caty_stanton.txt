The God of justice is with us, and our word, our work - our prayer for freedom will not, cannot be in vain.
There would be more sense in insisting on man's limitations because he cannot be a mother than on a woman's because she can be.
The more I think on the present condition of woman, the more am I oppressed with the reality of their degradation.
The right is ours. Have it we must. Use it we will.
The strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education, for the full development of her faculties, her forces of mind and body... is the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life.
To have drunkards, idiots, horse-racing, rumselling rowdies, ignorant foreigners, and silly boys fully recognized, while we ourselves are thrust out from all the rights that belong to citizens, it is too grossly insulting to... be longer quietly submitted to.
