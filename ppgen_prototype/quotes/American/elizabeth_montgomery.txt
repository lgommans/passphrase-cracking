Television is such a mediocre medium.
I get letters from people saying one of the things they like best about what I've done since 'Bewitched' is that they never know what I'm going to do next.
I'd never thought much about a series, because I liked the idea of picking a script I liked with a character I thought I could sustain for an hour. In a series, you live with one character day in and day out - and you only hope it will be one that will not drive you crazy.
