The only thing better than singing is more singing.
Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong.
I'm very shy, and I shy away from people. But the moment I hit the stage, it's a different feeling I get nerve from somewhere; maybe it's because it's something I love to do.
It isn't where you came from, its where you're going that counts.
I stole everything I ever heard, but mostly I stole from the horns.
Did I do all right?
