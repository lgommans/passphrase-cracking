American,Actress
Balancing school, acting, and a social life can be difficult.
I love to play the guitar. I also love photography and fashion.
I'm not so great at keeping secrets; maybe that's why no one ever tells me things.
I don't get embarrassed easily, and I do silly things all the time!
I love Audrey Hepburn. I thought she was very classy.
Disney Channel is celebrities coated in sugar. Everything is really happy; everything is really bright.
Actors pull from their own experiences to bring reality to the characters. I wouldn't want to play someone who's a lot like me. There would be no turning it on or off.
Everyone needs to be able to have their own space in which to be themselves.
