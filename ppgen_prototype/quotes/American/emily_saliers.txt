Artists and celebrities are citizens, and as such you have a responsibility to keep fighting for justice because there are monolithic power structures and systemic oppression out there.
Whenever anybody gets involved in politics, its always exciting for me because we take for granted our freedoms and our abilities to effect change through political activism.
I was never forced to go to church, and there is a lot of beauty in Christianity that I take in my life as a gift, and there is a lot of beauty in other religions. I'm kind of a spiritual mutt.
I was in a church choir early on and that really helped me musically in terms of chops, learning how to sing harmonies.
When I'm home, I cook. I love cooking for people.
I love Decatur. It is diverse, politically progressive, family oriented and I can walk everywhere.
