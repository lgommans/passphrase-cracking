American,Actress
I love just how beautiful Vancouver is. I mean, everywhere you look it's just mountains and ocean.
I've worked with some of the most inspiring and genuinely nice people.
I feel like we're attracted to paths in life that force us to look at our weaknesses or deficiencies as human beings. Not to get all deep on you, but that's how I feel.
If I weren't acting, I would own my own chocolate shop in Paris. I would be a nice, overweight person that makes chocolate all day long.
I love really, really deep, dark-as-Russia storylines. I love supernatural aspects. I grew up with ghost stories.
I live in L.A. - I love L.A., first off - but I didn't realize how much better the air quality was in Vancouver until I went back to L.A. for a weekend and I literally felt like I was breathing fire.
