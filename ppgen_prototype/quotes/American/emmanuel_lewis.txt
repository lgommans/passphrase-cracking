I know what kind of person he is so they can say whatever they want.
Michael is not only my friend, he's my family.

I want to direct, produce, and write, learning as I go.
I do what I believe.
Since I know how crazy this business is, I do the opposite of what I see other people doing.
Sometimes kids used to give me a hard time. But they're on my side.
I'm perfectly healthy.
I like projects in which I can really act and not be me all the time.
