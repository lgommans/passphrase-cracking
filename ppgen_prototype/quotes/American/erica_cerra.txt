American,Actress
My most memorable recognition story was in Venice, Italy. My fiance and I were renting a car, and I was recognized by the person standing behind me by my voice. I thought that was hysterical!
I do really love singing. It's something that I have always liked to do.
When I grew up, my dad always used to watch 'Star Trek' and any and every sci-fi show you could imagine. I used to watch it with him, and I loved it.
I loved all fantasy, and I always thought that the ideal job as a performer and an entertainer would be to take on a mythical character, you know? Make someone up. Give them a voice, a mannerism, whatever. I always thought that that was the coolest way to do.
I love my sci-fi. I love my fantasy. Yeah! I can say it. I'm a geek. I'm a geek and I'm a proud geek!
I've always been a person who thinks it's really important to better themselves.
I know a lot of people recognize me or know me from 'Battlestar Galactica,' but I only did a couple of episodes.
I grew up in Vancouver and my father drove me to every single one of my acting lessons, auditions, and jobs.
