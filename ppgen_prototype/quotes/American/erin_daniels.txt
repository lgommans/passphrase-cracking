American,Actress
I don't pick roles based on how famous they are going to make me; I pick roles based on how they're going to inspire me intellectually.
I love a good steak with a great glass of red wine. But for the TV watching, laying around doing nothing kinds of days, nothing beats a pepperoni pizza and chocolate Haagen Daas.
