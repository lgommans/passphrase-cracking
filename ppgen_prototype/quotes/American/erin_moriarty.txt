Throughout high school, I was fairly boring. I didn't do many rebellious things.
I love romantic comedies... but they have to be done right, but when they are, they're great.
My parents are both very stylish, so they always encouraged me to explore when it came to personal style. I went through a lot of crazy phases, and I'm still finding myself.
'Fargo' definitely makes it into my top three favorite films of all time; I have a serious obsession with the Coen brothers.
I would love to work with the Coen brothers and Terrence Malick. I love both of their bodies of work so much, so I'm really interested in acting under their direction.
Jordan Vogt-Roberts directed me in 'Kings of Summer,' which was his debut feature. I got to witness the passion and hunger that first-time directors bring to projects, and ever since, then I've been very intrigued when I've come across a project with a less experienced director.
