I'm not a short person; I'm 5'10 and I was wearing heels, and I felt like a tiny little creature next to Shaquille O'Neal.
I used to watch 'Grey's Anatomy' pretty religiously.
I was so sad that 'Best Friends Forever' got cancelled. I thought it was a great show and NBC didn't give it a chance. I'm a big fan of the NBC comedies.
It's such a weird thing to try to plan a baby around a TV season. There's a three-month or four-month window in the summertime to have a baby and hang out with it a little bit before hopefully going back to work, so we were just very lucky.
