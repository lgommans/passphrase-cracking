All the real things in Russia are done in the villages.
Here we grow the flax and grain; here we raise the meat they eat, and the wool to keep them warm; we cut trees to build their houses and firewood to heat their stoves.
The trouble with those people is that they think all the best things are made in the cities. It is not so.
What kind of crops do they raise in the towns? Only Grand Dukes, Bolsheviks and drunkards!
