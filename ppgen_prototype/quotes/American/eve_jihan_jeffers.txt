American,Musician
I did not let people tell me what to do, and I never wanted to be a groupie.
My dream collaboration is with Lauryn Hill. Is that ever gonna' happen? Who knows! But there's still a lot I feel like musically I could do.
I listen to every thing, all kinds of stuff. I've been obsessed with the Nas and Damian Marley record, 'Distant Relatives.' I feel like a lot of people haven't heard it, and it's amazing.
I'm such a girly-girl! I don't know why people don't see that.
I'm still a tomboy at heart. In high school, I was the girl in the baggy jeans and Timberlands, but I was also at the hairdresser's every week.
I can't wait to have kids. I want so many. I want to adopt and have my own.
