With a play, for me, there's no time to sit back on it. You're living on your instincts. And every night there are subtle changes and adjustments, because what's in front of you is a living, breathing audience.
Every play should be 90 minutes. There would be so many more theatre-goers if plays were shorter.
As a jobbing actor, I never get a script and go 'I can't be bothered with this.' Life doesn't work like that. For a movie star, maybe, but for a jobbing actor, that doesn't happen.
My goal is to stay happy in my work and to do quality work.
Let's be honest, L.A. is not a bad place to live. There are some crazy people there, but I tend to get on with them!
A 'Torchwood' movie would be incredible. It would be sensational to have a beginning, a middle and an end in ninety minutes. A big walloping 'Torchwood' crunched into ninety minutes would be breathtaking.
