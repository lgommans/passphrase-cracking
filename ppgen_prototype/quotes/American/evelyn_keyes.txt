American,Actress
I was the original Cinderella girl, looking for the happy ending in the fairy story. But my fantasy prince never came.
I have often wondered what my life would have been like if I had needed a size thirty-eight bra instead of a modest thirty-four.
To become a big movie star like Joan Crawford, you need to wear blinders and pay single-minded attention to your career. Nobody paid attention to me, including me.
I was always looking for the same man - a strong father figure.
I was always interested in the man of the moment - and there were so many such moments.
I'm the first to admit that I never achieved my potential as an actress.
I got to star in my own movies. I even had my name above the title in some cases. But what am I known for? My bit part.
