I adore burgers. I know they are bad for me, and only technically a sandwich, but a well made burger, juicy and hot off the grill, is wonderful!
Humans are insane. We kill our own people, starve our own people, sell them, work them to death, beat them, don't give them affordable/free/good healthcare, and let them live in misery, while a few of us have - we have all we want. We are evil.
There are lots of antagonists in the 'Jane Yellowrock' series, but one stands out as uber-evil to me, and that is Lucas DeAllyon.
Shelter dogs are the most loving, wonderful, sweet pets in the world. They understand being rescued, loved, and protected. The hubs and I have 2 rescued 11-yr-old Pomeranians, who adore us.
