Temperance is moderation in the things that are good and total abstinence from the things that are foul.
The world is wide, and I will not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.
This seems to be the law of progress in everything we do; it moves along a spiral rather than a perpendicular; we seem to be actually going out of the way, and yet it turns out that we were really moving upward all the time.
In externals we advance with lightening express speed, in modes of thought and sympathy we lumber on in stage-coach fashion.
