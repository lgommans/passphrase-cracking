The only power you have is the word no.
I never trusted good-looking boys.
I like hard rock, and classic rock, and even metal.
The fact that I'm sleeping with the director may have something to do with it.
Most women's pictures are as boring and as formulaic as men's pictures. In place of a car chase or a battle scene, what you get is an extreme closeup of a woman breaking down.
I'm a character actress, plain and simple... Who can worry about a career? Have a life. Movie stars have careers - actors work, and then they don't work, and then they work again.
I don't think you can ever completely transform yourself on film, but if you do your job well, you can make people believe that you're the character you're trying to be.
I am an ordinary person.
Who can worry about a career? Have a life.
I don't think of myself as a movie star and I can pretty easily convince other people that I'm not a movie star.
I haven't wanted to play a mother for a long time because I am one.
It's much easier to play supporting roles because that's what I do in my life: I support my son.
Certainly, a lot of the films I've worked on have ended up good movies, but they haven't always been the best experiences.
Movie stars have careers - actors work, and then they don't work, and then they work again.
It's a scary thing going into the workforce with a $50,000 debt and you've been trained as a classical theatre actor. There's always a depression in the theatre.
There's only two givens with choosing acting as a profession: one is you will always be unemployed, always, and it doesn't matter how much money you make, you're still always going to be unemployed; and that you have no power.
