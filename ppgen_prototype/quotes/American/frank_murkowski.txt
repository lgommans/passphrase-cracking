American,Politician
One of Alaska's strengths is our pioneer role in environmentally sensitive development.
I firmly believe that we can have a healthy environment and a sustainable timber industry.
Pushing production out of America to nations without our environmental standards increases global environmental risks.
Alaska has great potential for new oil and gas development.
