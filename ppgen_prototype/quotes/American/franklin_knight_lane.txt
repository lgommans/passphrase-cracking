American,Politician
Newspaper men, perhaps more than any other class, are rated by ability.
A public office is not a job, it is an opportunity to do something for the public.
I have hardly seen my baby for six weeks; have been at the office from nine A.M. to eleven P.M. regularly.
No man should have a political office because he wants a job.
It is work and personal worth which make a State great both politically and industrially, and in my estimation they are to be found in largest proportions in the Democratic party.
I am not the flag: not at all. I am but its shadow.
My stars and my stripes are your dream and your labors.
For you are the makers of the flag and it is well that you glory in the making.
