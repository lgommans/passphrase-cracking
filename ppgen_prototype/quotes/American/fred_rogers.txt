I like to compare the holiday season with the way a child listens to a favorite story. The pleasure is in the familiar way the story begins, the anticipation of familiar turns it takes, the familiar moments of suspense, and the familiar climax and ending.
Play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning. But for children play is serious learning. Play is really the work of childhood.
Knowing that we can be loved exactly as we are gives us all the best opportunity for growing into the healthiest of people.
When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'
Parents are like shuttles on a loom. They join the threads of the past with threads of the future and leave their own bright patterns as they go.
I think of discipline as the continual everyday process of helping a child learn self-discipline.
You know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable.
How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.
