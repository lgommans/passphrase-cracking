TV is bigger than any story it reports. It's the greatest teaching tool since the printing press.
A composite is a euphemism for a lie. It's disorderly. It's dishonest and it's not journalism.
Television makes so much at its worst that it can't afford to do its best.
Television was supposed to be a national park. Instead it has become a money machine. It's a commodity now, just like pork bellies.
The news is the one thing the networks can point to with pride. Everything else they do is crap, and they know it.
