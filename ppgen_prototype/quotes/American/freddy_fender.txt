Hopefully I'll be the first Mexican-American going into Hillbilly Heaven.
I was dreaming I was on the Sullivan Show.
I was separated from my wife at the time. A lot of people think I wrote it about prison.
I'm one year away from 70 and I've had a good run. I really believe I'm okay.
I'm a romantic, and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel. We love more, and we hurt more. When we're hurt, we hurt for a long time.
In my mind and in my heart, I feel okay. I cannot complain that I haven't lived long enough, but I'd like to live longer.
My sister and I were born in San Francisco. When our parents died, we came down here to live with relatives.
They wanted to start recording rock 'n roll, and thought I had the right voice.
Wasted Days and Wasted Nights, it's about days very wrongly invested in a love affair.
Whenever I run into prejudice. I smile and feel sorry for them, and I say to myself, There's one more argument for birth control.
