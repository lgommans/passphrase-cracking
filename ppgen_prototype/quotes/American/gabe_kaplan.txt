American,Comedian
In show business, you had levels. I was at the top of the TV end of it.
I could've always worked shows, clubs, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but I was successful in business ventures, and things weren't happening in show business, so I said, 'Let me see what I can do.'
Maybe I just wasn't a show-biz type. I didn't miss performing at all.
I think people will believe anything about someone they haven't seen for a while.
I mean, I would have loved to have kept on being a big television star. If that's the way things would have broke, I would have loved to have done that. I just didn't really want to continue and be someone who took whatever was offered.
Maybe 10 times a year I'll do a corporate date, but no casinos or no nightclubs or no comedy clubs.
When I first came to do shows in Vegas, I followed the usual entertainer's syndrome - I played craps and lost.
