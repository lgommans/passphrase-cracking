American,Novelist
The race of children possesses magically sagacious powers.
Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths pure theatre.
One is taught by experience to put a premium on those few people who can appreciate you for what you are.
Dreams say what they mean, but they don't say it in daytime language.
The act of longing for something will always be more intense than the requiting of it.
None of us suddenly becomes something overnight. The preparations have been in the making for lifetime.
