It's funny, as a little kid, you look up to those guys who you play as in 'Madden,' and now to see myself in the game, it's an honor.
I'm a four-down guy. I can rush the passer and stop the run. I know I can be a difference-maker.
You know you've made your mark when you're on the cover of a videogame.
I want to be a great player. I don't want to play for the money. I don't want to play for fame. I'd just as soon no one knew who I was. I want to play football because it's football.
Greg White got a boxer because I said I was getting one. I was talking about getting a boxer since before training camp.
Back home in South Carolina, you have a lot of little soul food restaurants you can run to and get some quick, decent food.
I like to have fun, but I also try to make time for my son.
First of all, I want to thank the Buccaneers for giving me the opportunity and for picking me in the draft. This is the nature of the beast, though, and this is a new start for me. I wish them the best of luck, and I am just glad to be a Bear.
Coach Morris wasn't too hard on me, not at all. Being drafted where I was at, there were high expectations for me. I still have high expectations for myself.
Every day I went to work at Tampa, I gave it my all.
Julius Peppers is a beast, man. I don't know how many pounds he outweighs me by... I still try to do things like him to make my game better.
I feel like by me putting on a couple more pounds will help my game tremendously. Putting on 10-15 pounds will help me stop the run better and be a more dominant pass rusher.
It really doesn't matter to me whether it's defensive end or linebacker. I just want to play the game of football. I've been working on linebacker drills since I got out to Fischer Sports in Phoenix.
I love getting after that quarterback! That's my deal: sacking the quarterback.
