American,Actor
The last thing in the world I should have done was go into the theater because was inordinately shy as a young man. I couldn't open my mouth. At a party, I was the one stuck up against the wall. I was embarrassed about talking. I felt that I couldn't talk well.
My voice, I have to say, is kind of miraculous because I was born with a cleft palate.
I had admired Richard Burton for years and years before I had ever worked with him. He was a great, great actor. It was a joy to get to know him as a person.
I think anybody who has been in the theater, prefers it. Television is a... factory. You turn out things on a revolving assembly line. You don't have time to perfect anything in television.
I've worked with very few that I considered unpleasant. Dennis the Menace was a joy to work on.
My wife and I love to read. We're going to have to move out to make room for the books! And we have our dogs.
