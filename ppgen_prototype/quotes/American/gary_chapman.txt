I think that in today's world, by nature, we are all self-centered. And that often leads to selfishness.
I have been doing marriage counseling for about 15 years and I realized that what makes one person feel loved, doesn't make another person feel loved.
I think people desperately want to feel love.
Love is reaching out to try to get to the other person.
