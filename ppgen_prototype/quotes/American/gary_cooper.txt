The only achievement I am really proud of is the friends I have made in this community.
In Westerns you were permitted to kiss your horse but never your girl.
The general consensus seems to be that I don't act at all.
I looked it at like this way. To get folks to like you, as a screen player I mean, I figured you had to sort of be their ideal. I don't mean a handsome knight riding a white horse, but a fella who answered the description of a right guy.
