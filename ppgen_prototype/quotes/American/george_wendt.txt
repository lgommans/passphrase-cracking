American,Actor
I not only get recognized - I get recognized from behind.
Honestly, I'm a shallow performer. I just go with the text and feel my way around it. There's not a whole lot of shaping.
Most of the holiday movies I enjoy, like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' don't really involve Santa.
I dream about 'Cheers.' Like when you go on a diet and you dream of pizza. I always think of those wonderful years. I loved working on it.
I like journalists.
I like New York.
Once in a while it can be a bit disconcerting to be so recognisable.
I really enjoy travel, I enjoy the U.K., I enjoy Scotland, Glasgow.
I get called to do a lot of labors of love... independent films on very small budgets. If I have the time and if the project speaks to me, it's better than sitting around, right?
I like to keep busy.
