I can have peace of mind only when I forgive rather than judge.
Forgiveness means letting go of the past.
Peace of mind comes from not wanting to change others.
When I am able to resist the temptation to judge others, I can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life, reminding me that I can only have peace of mind when I forgive rather than judge.
Inner peace can be reached only when we practice forgiveness. Forgiveness is letting go of the past, and is therefore the means for correcting our misperceptions.
Through our willingness to help others we can learn to be happy rather than depressed.
Love is the total absence of fear. Love asks no questions. Its natural state is one of extension and expansion, not comparison and measurement.
A truly creative person rids him or herself of all self-imposed limitations.
The best way to navigate through life is to give up all of our controls.
You can be right or you can be happy.
Other people do not have to change for us to experience peace of mind.
