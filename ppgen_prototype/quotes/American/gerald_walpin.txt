American,Public Servant
I am now the target of the most powerful man in this country, with an army of aides whose major responsibility today seems to be to attack me and get rid of me.
I would never say President Obama doesn't have the capacity to continue to serve because of his statement that there are 56 states.
It appears to suggest that I was removed because I was disabled - based on one occasion out of hundreds.
I know that I and my office acted with the highest integrity as an independent inspector general should act.
