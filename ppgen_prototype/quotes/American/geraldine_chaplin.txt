Drugs are marvelous if you want to escape, but reality is so rich, why escape?
I didn't fall in love with acting until I did a few films. Now, I couldn't live without it.
It's the change of rhythm which I think is what keeps me alive. In Spain I hear so much noise from my window that can't stand it. In Switzerland it's the lack of noise that drives me crazy.
When I'm depressed and I feel low thinking that good movies are not made any more, then I put on his movies and I watch them. I laugh and I cry and I have great pleasure.
I was born in Santa Monica but brought up abroad so I don't use English much.
I live in a Swiss village so small, if you sneeze everyone knows.
