I can always be distracted by love, but eventually I get horny for my creativity.
Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next.
The goal is to live a full, productive life even with all that ambiguity. No matter what happens, whether the cancer never flares up again or whether you die, the important thing is that the days that you have had you will have lived.
While we have the gift of life, it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die - whether it is our spirit, our creativity or our glorious uniqueness.
I'd much rather be a woman than a man. Women can cry, they can wear cute clothes, and they're the first to be rescued off sinking ships.
Having cancer gave me membership in an elite club I'd rather not belong to.
I base most of my fashion taste on what doesn't itch.
Comedy is very controlling - you are making people laugh.
Some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end.
Adopted kids are such a pain - you have to teach them how to look like you.
Dreams are like paper, they tear so easily.
I'm so full I can't hear.
You feel completely in control when you hear a wave of laughter coming back at you that you have caused.
There is no real security except for whatever you build inside yourself.
I grew up in front of a television. I guess I'll grow old inside of one.
I think clothes should make you feel safe. I like clothes you want to go to sleep in. I sometimes stand in front of a mirror and change a million times because I know I really want to wear my nightgown.
I would say that Lucy, 'I Love Lucy,' she was my idol.
I'm not really an impersonator.
Fame changes a lot of things, but it can't change a lightbulb.
