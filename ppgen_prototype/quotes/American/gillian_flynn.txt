I have four or five ideas that just keep floating around and I want to kind of just let one - like a beautiful butterfly, let it land somewhere.
I'm all for whatever transitions the book properly to a movie.
I'm a true-crime addict. It's not something I'm particularly proud of, but I can't stop.
I grew up in the '80s where there's a lot of these kind of post-apocalyptic, post-comet, post-whatever it was, so that always captured my imagination a lot as a little kid, that idea of getting access to secret places and being able to roam around where you're not supposed to.
There are no really new stories anymore.
I can't think of anything more crushing than slowly, over time, realizing exactly how wrong you were about someone.
I think mystery writers and thriller writers - whatever genre you want to call it - are taking on some of the biggest, most interesting kind of socioeconomic issues around in a really interesting, compelling way.
We're into this barrage of pop culture - you know, TV, movies, the Internet. We become creatures that we've made up, made of certain different flotsam from pop culture and certain different personas that are in style.
To me, marriage is the ultimate mystery.
I feel like I need to give people a note with the book that says, 'I'm OK, no worries!'
