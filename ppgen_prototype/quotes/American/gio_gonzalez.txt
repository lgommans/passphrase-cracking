American,Athlete
To be a small town kid from Hialeah, Fla., pitching in Miami and representing Team U.S.A., that says it all. It's a kid's dream. Don't pinch me. I don't want to wake up.
I remember my rookie hazing. It wasn't fun.
I remember when I started off, my first car was a Kia Spectra. With a spoiler kit and some rims.
I'm definitely not a 'Fast and a Furious' guy.
At 19, I was still figuring out how to throw a fastball.
I couldn't throw a knuckleball if my life depended on it.
I'm Cuban-American, everybody says. I have a Cuban background, Cuban blood.
It's an honor to represent a Latin culture.
