American,Producer
I'm proudest of the fact that I fell in step with an audience taste level that I knew how to judge and maybe deliver for, and consistently.
I call it predicament humor. You don't do anything that cuts the star off at the knees or worse. You make him intelligent; you give him great ideas and great things to do.
I tried to stay with things until I thought they were on their feet and they learned to walk and talk.
If you believe in something, you must will it through, because everything gets in the way. Everyone tries to steer the ship off course.
I was vested emotionally in 'Battlestar.' I really loved the thematic things. I don't feel it really got its shot, and I can't blame anyone else; I was at the center of that.
Television networks are a lot like automobile manufacturers or anyone else who's in commerce. If something out there catches on with the public... I guess you can call it 'market research.'
