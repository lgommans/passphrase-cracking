Women's natural role is to be a pillar of the family.
For a woman, forty is torture, the end.
I don't want to be married to someone who feels inferior to my success or because I make more money than he does.
I don't want to dress up a picture with just my face.
If anybody starts using me as scenery, I'll return to New York.
I don't like yelling and fighting, and I can't quarrel.
The freedom of the press works in such a way that there is not much freedom from it.
Getting angry doesn't solve anything.
Emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery.
As an unmarried woman, I was thought to be a danger.
Other women looked on me as a rival. And it pained me a great deal.
