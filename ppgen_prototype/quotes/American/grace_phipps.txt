I like my monsters to be monsters.
Oh my God. Am I a 'Buffy' fan? 'Buffy' on DVD got me through middle school.
Since 'Buffy,' vampires have become kind of softer and gushier instead of, you know, man-eating monsters.
I used to eat lunch with the teachers at school. I just remember that kids would put their legs on the seats next to them so that I wouldn't have a place to sit.
Yes, obviously, I would love to play a vampire! I mean, I went to Hot Topic and got the fake vampire teeth for Halloween in middle school. Obviously, I want fangs sometime!
