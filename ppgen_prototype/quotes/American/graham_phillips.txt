My character on 'The Good Wife' is a smaller character, and his story arcs are typically season-long, unless it's a big episode for him. His transitions take place over many, many hours.
I think that the reason why 'Goats' is called 'Goats' is because you can't give direction to goats. They do what they want. That's the point of this film.
My parents walked in on me Googling 'agents for kids' when I was 9.
Animals are the best actors. They never lie, they're always present, and they listen. That's a lot more than a lot of actors can say for themselves.
The only reason why you should do a film is because it creatively carbonates you and gets you going. If you're doing it for any other reason, you've lost sight of why you're acting in the first place.
With film, you read the whole script three or four times, and you really have a solid blueprint of who your character is. Whereas in television, that blueprint is constantly changing and adapting, and sometimes you have to take a risk.
Eventually I'd love to be able to direct.
The caliber of actors I'm getting to work with and learn from on a daily basis is phenomenal for me as a developing actor.
