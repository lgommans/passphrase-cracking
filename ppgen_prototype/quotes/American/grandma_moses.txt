American,Artist
A strange thing is memory, and hope; one looks backward, and the other forward; one is of today, the other of tomorrow. Memory is history recorded in our brain, memory is a painter, it paints pictures of the past and of the day.
Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.
I look out the window sometimes to seek the color of the shadows and the different greens in the trees, but when I get ready to paint I just close my eyes and imagine a scene.
Painting's not important. The important thing is keeping busy.
If I hadn't started painting, I would have raised chickens.
A primitive artist is an amateur whose work sells.
I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I am satisfied with it.
I paint from the top down. From the sky, then the mountains, then the hills, then the houses, then the cattle, and then the people.
If you know somethin' well, you can always paint it but people would be better off buyin' chickens.
