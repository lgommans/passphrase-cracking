Collaboration is much like a birth. The song that springs forth resembles each one of us to a degree, but it's the kind of thing that would never be born from just one of us sitting down with a guitar.
I've made a few albums in such an autonomous way; it often has been exhausting. It's almost difficult to enjoy the process when you take on so much.
I think a lot of songwriters would agree that it's often easier to find inspiration in misery.
There's nothing more painful than something that's superficially upbeat but you can kind of tell behind it that there's a cynicism, or even a bitterness.
I'm always keen to head to where the greatest gravitation pull is tugging me.
I played with the same band for years and years and there's a beauty to having one solid core that you keep exploring. On the other hand, it's nice to throw yourself in different situations where you find out things about your own resources.
Being an actor is a much more structured life than being a musician.
I don't know how other bands play the same songs every night.
I don't like knowing what the next song is because that's what I'd think about during the number we're playing.
