It's interesting because Swedes subtitle everything, so they're so used to it. When my wife watches a show with subtitles, she has a skill to be able to watch and read. Whereas I'm more of a read or watch.
If you take my own life, the longer you stay in a country, you almost lose your former self and become this third-party person who is caught in between two worlds.
I didn't really watch 'Dallas,' so I wasn't as wowed by the idea of Patrick Duffy as Swedes were 'cause he's, like, the most famous guy in all of Sweden.
In my whole life, when I've watched TV and movies, I've almost always felt, 'I could do that better,' and I thought everyone felt that way.
When you're a litigator, you write so much, so many briefs, over and over again, that you're kind of really focused on one document and have draft after draft, and really pay attention to every single word.
I met my wife in New York, so, we lived together there for five years, so my Swedish was kind of a gradual learning process.
I feel like the longer I hold out - I feel like as soon I move to L.A., I just become one of a million.
If you only get one roller-coaster ride, you don't want to be thinking about the second one when you're on it.
You don't take food home from restaurants in Sweden.
I was a lawyer for 12 years in New York and Sweden.
My philosophy on love is that if it is The One, whatever the circumstances are, you'll figure it out. There's nothing too difficult to overcome.
Acting is always something I thought I could do, and I thought I would be pretty good at it, but I thought that I missed the opportunity, that it was too late.
I created, wrote, produced, and starred in my first-ever acting gig!
I speak Swedish mainly with my kids' friends.
It's funny, I lived my first 38 years of my life with maybe one or two people ever saying that I looked like Greg Kinnear. As soon as I get into the entertainment industry, now it's 100 percent of people.
