American,Actor
Actors really are superstitious. You can always spot a group of actors at a restaurant. They're the ones spitting on their knuckles and hurling salt everywhere.
Like many actors, I'm very grateful, I feel very fortunate, very lucky to be able to make a living with what I do and what I love. I'm surprised and grateful all the time.
I consider myself an actor that tries to have as many tools as possible in the bag. And I think that includes the method, then of course it includes some improv techniques, and includes all kinds of different things, because you never know when you're going to have to work on something and in what way.
I'd trained at the University of Washington and had a Bachelor of Fine Arts in acting.
