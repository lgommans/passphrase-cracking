American,Actor
I've never worked for a show or was on a show where I didn't have a lot of control creatively, but then again, I haven't worked on a lot of shows.
I've learned to wait 'til an idea is worth making. That's not really a lesson I've learned; I sort of always did it that way. But there's no reason or need to make videos prior to when you make a show, because then you need material for it.
I need to lose some weight. I'm getting really fat. But I'm getting older, and I just can't stop eating wonderful food. Rich, wonderful food.
It's physically hard for me to work. I start to break down, physically. My joints start. I get weepy eyes. I don't sleep well. I was never a hard worker, I guess. So the voiceover work ethic is really great for me - couple days a month, two hours a day.
I'm not opposed to putting myself in danger for meaningless comedy.
Cute girls and burgers. What more can you ask for? That's why we live in America.
I started doing comedy with no plan to do voice work. Voice work came as a function of doing comedy and meeting people who eventually develop shows like that. I didn't seek out from an early age to be on cartoons.
I never pursued acting with, like, auditions. If anything, I was given roles by people who knew me and liked what I did.
If you do nothing long enough, something's bound to happen.
