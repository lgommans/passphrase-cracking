The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.
Love ain't nothing but sex misspelled.
When belief in a god dies, the god dies.
To say more, is to say less.
I have no mouth, and I must scream.
I hate being wrong, but I love it when I'm set straight.
I don't mind you thinking I'm stupid, but don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
