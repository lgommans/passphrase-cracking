American,Actor
You want to be on your toes; You don't want to be in a Nic Cage movie and just have him blow by you as an actor.
The music is just so rich and part of the culture there. I suddenly felt like I needed to go on this mission to make sure we save New Orleans because - not that I can save anything - but it's so much part of what this country is, this whole mix of people coming together and doing this thing.
I was just mind-blown to find that New Orleans is just so much more fun and interesting than I had ever thought.
Before I went to New Orleans, I was a little scared of New Orleans. I don't know why. I had only been there a few times. Something about it made me feel nervous, knowing a bit about the history.
I get to hang out with people I think are awesome, and do work I think is awesome. It's really cool.
