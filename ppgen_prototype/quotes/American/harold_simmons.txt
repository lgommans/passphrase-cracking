You never talk about what you want when giving money. I don't pay attention to what other people think... There shouldn't be restrictions of any kind on political contributions.
Money brings a lot of responsibility as to what you're going to do with it, and I've given quite a bit of thought to that.
I'm not trying to change an image, I'm just trying to make sure that the facts match the image. The facts are basically that I'm a builder. I have not dissembled any company nor split up any companies, nor do I ever buy any companies with that intent.
I don't think I have a black-hat image.
I definitely have a shareholders' perspective. I'm not doing that altruistically. I'm doing that because it's in my own self interest to do it. I think that's good for my other shareholders because they go along with me: If I do well for myself, then they do well for themselves.
