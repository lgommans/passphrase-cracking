American,Actor
In those days I was mortified, because I was a serious actor in my own mind, and then all of a sudden I'm this hunk.
Aaron Echolls is one of the best characters that I've ever played.
I get to play a great character while working with great actors and great directors on a great show.
I think people enjoyed LA Law so much, because it was the first show that delved into current events through the prism of the law.
People will have an altered idea of who you are unless they really take time to get to know you, which of course they don't. They just get what they see, and they take that to the bank.
I'm not as focused on my acting career as I have been in the past.
I'd like to find great roles close to home and work on great projects while staying near my family. My family's the most important thing to me right now.
I get interested in writers who are enigmatic.
If you play a gay role, it sticks more than it does if an actor were to play a murderer or a psychopath.
