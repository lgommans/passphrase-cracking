American,Businessman
The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.
Success is the sum of details.
I believe fundamental honesty is the keystone of business.
You get the best out of others when you get the best out of yourself.
The way of the pioneer is always rough.
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed.
Thought, not money, is the real business capital.
If you have ideas, you have the main asset you need, and there isn't any limit to what you can do with your business and your life. Ideas are any man's greatest asset.
Capital isn't that important in business. Experience isn't that important. You can get both of these things. What is important is ideas.
I can walk through the front door of any factory and out the back and tell you if it's making money or not. I can just tell by the way it's being run and by the spirit of the workers.
The secret of my success is a two word answer: Know people.
Our company is built on people - those who work for us, and those we do business with.
