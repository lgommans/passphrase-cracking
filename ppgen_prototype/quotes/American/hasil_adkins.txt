I don't live on a hill. I live down under a hill, in the bottom and I've got a lot of cars, yeah.
I got about 6037 songs I wrote myself and I'm trying to get them on the market and I just wish people could hear them and stuff but they'll do pretty good.
My first record came out in 1961 and then I had one come out in 1962 and then I had two that came out in 1964.
That's when we was makin this video stuff. They went all over the place makin it. And they was wantin to know, at the college, how I got started playin and how do I do everything - you know, all that.
Up to now I've done everything I've wanted to do the way I wanted to do myself.
