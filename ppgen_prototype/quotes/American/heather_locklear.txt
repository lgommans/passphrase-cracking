American,Actress
You can't keep changing men, so you settle for changing your lipstick.
When I look in the mirror I see the girl I was when I was growing up, with braces, crooked teeth, a baby face and a skinny body.
Sex appeal is not on purpose.
You just have to forgive them for being men.
With a parent, it's always guilt. You want to be there, but you kind of also want to be here.
Playing bad is always more fun than playing good.
I think I've always been good so God wouldn't strike me dead.
First of all, I would like to clear the air on one thing. Alison has slept with more men than Amanda; Sydney has slept with more men than Amanda; I think Matt has slept with more men than Amanda.
The older you get, the farther from the camera you need to be.
Anybody can say she's an actress. It's another thing to get a job.
One man is not enough.
You have to be very careful with women friends.
I don't date rock 'n' rollers. I just marry them.
There are times when I feel lazy and just want to stay in bed all day, but I know that working out is the best way to get those endorphins going, which will make me feel better emotionally and physically.
You can't help but be scrutinized, so I might as well be doing something while I'm being scrutinized.
I don't date. The thought of that is so yuck.
I don't know how Hollywood sees me.
I'd like roles with more depth.
