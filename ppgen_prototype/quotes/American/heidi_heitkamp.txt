Congressman Berg will repeatedly talk about Harry Reid and Barack Obama, and I find it interesting, because this morning, when I woke up and brushed my teeth, I looked in the mirror and I did not see a tall, African-American, skinny man. So let's make it clear that my priorities are North Dakota priorities.
We should show Washington how we do it in North Dakota. I'm running to stop the over-regulating of our economy and start growing it.
We can only imagine what would happen to our health care and to the quality of our health care here in North Dakota if we took the federal government out of health care.
