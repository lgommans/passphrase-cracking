Having an aim is the key to achieving your best.
Problems are only opportunities in work clothes.
I make progress by having people around me who are smarter than I am and listening to them. And I assume that everyone is smarter about something than I am.
Live daringly, boldly, fearlessly. Taste the relish to be found in competition - in having put forth the best within you.
I always have to dream up there against the stars. If I don't dream I will make it, I won't even get close.
When your work speaks for itself, don't interrupt.
Trouble is only an opportunity in work clothes.
You can't sit on the lid of progress. If you do, you will be blown to pieces.
