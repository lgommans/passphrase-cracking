Teaching is like flying a plane. You leave school one day feeling like you're spiraling down toward the trees, expecting that the next day the crash will come. You brace yourself for the impact, only to find that things have leveled out at treetop height, and you climb and enjoy the remainder of the flight.
In 1996, after 29 years as an artist for Marvel Comics, I got fired - 56 years old, two children still in college, and no job.
I had joined Marvel in 1967, after a year in Vietnam and three years as a student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Stan Lee, then the editor-in-chief, hired me as a production assistant.
I've decided to go for a B.A. in art. It's the shortest route to a degree. I'm thinking about teaching.
There's something about dealing with government agencies that makes you feel like a criminal.
I think that most of us can identify with the change that happens to Bruce Banner. We all have a little of both inside us. I think this is an important theme in defining the character.
The Hulk is not basically violent, but only reacts violently when a threat is perceived. He has a certain passion for life. He is drawn towards kids and animals and the downtrodden.
When I looked at the other artists when I first started at Marvel, I was surrounded by giants. It was very intimidating.
The only thing that remained consistent over the years was my ability and enthusiasm to tell the story.
