Good skin is the best foundation for your makeup.
In real life, I'm so brutally honest that it almost works against me sometimes.
As actors, sometimes we want our character to go somewhere different than it goes, but that's being an actor.
Most actresses are always running late - I'm no exception.
I'm not a big eye makeup girl unless there's a professional doing it - otherwise I look like I have two black eyes!
You get the information, and it's not your job to judge it or not judge it. You adapt, and you do it. That's what we do as actors. We're just as surprised as the viewers, sometimes.
I just always wanted to sit in a casting session and see all of the train wrecks that come in.
One of my favorite movies is 'Back to the Future'.
I always feel like everything I shoot is a student project, and nobody else knows about it. I forget, in the moment, that other people will see it.
If you manifest your true self through nature and your normal surroundings, I find that the most eerie. Like when you see birds suddenly start flying in a different direction or when you see moths forming weird shapes, I think that's the weirdest way to let yourself be known.
I bought a car, but not just any car; I bought a Volvo, which was the safest on the road at the time. It's not any more, so I upgraded to the Mercedes.
I'm a huge Michael J. Fox fan.
Between Twitter and Facebook and how close you can be with your fans and how close they can be to you these days is, I think, quite miraculous. It's like getting a greeting card every single day.
