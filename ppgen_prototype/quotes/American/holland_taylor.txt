American,Actress
I love playing someone who just skates by and does anything she wants.
I notice that most of the men who tease me about my hair, don't have any.
It's interesting, I had absolutely no maternal instinct. I'm much more interested in young people now.
I've had some marvelous parts, but I'm also asked to play characters who are kind of superficial people.
I've never written a play before, and I'll never write one again. You can quote me.
I've had a long life and a lot of relationships and not one of them do I wish - well, I take that back - there are a couple I could have done without.
I always did think I would be married and settled down by now but maybe I ain't ready.
I just never was the marrying kind.
I've often played very strong, flashy, kind of inadvertently mean women. I am not that way in my real life.
I've always had a hunger for realizing myself through my career.
It took a long time to get to the place in my career where I could pick and choose what I wanted to do.
