American,Musician
I don't really unwind after a performance. I'm still pumped up and just want to get back on stage.
Music can help you through any kind of emotion. It can help you through a break-up, make you dance, or help you realize or understand something about yourself... and if I can sing a song and make someone feel those things then I will feel like I have made a difference.
For me the voice is the most important, but making your singing believable makes a great performer.
I never want to pick an easy song. I want to continue to challenge myself vocally.
I would like my album to be on the pop side with a little bit of soul. I would like to make music that is on the top of the charts right now.
