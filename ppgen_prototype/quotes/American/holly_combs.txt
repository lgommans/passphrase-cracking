Before you have a baby, friends tell you 'sleep now,' and you laugh because you don't think that all those stories could be true. But they are.
Both my husband and I wanted a boy. I wasn't sure what I'd do with a daughter. What if she asked for a Barbie? I would have been like, 'Honey, we don't support Barbie because she isn't an accurate depiction of a woman's body.'
You need to be emotionally ready for a baby, and the best way to do that is to clean skeletons from your own closest. Deal with the baggage of your childhood, or you'll just pass it on to your kid.
I think letting babies cry it out is barbaric. Why would parenting stop when it's dark outside? You can't expect a baby to know that he's supposed to sleep just because we want to go to bed.
I was the product of very young parents, and they had wild ways. My mother was in a punk band. Rebelling would have been learning to play piano.
I have no interest in a guy who doesn't know the right end of a screwdriver.
Felicity Huffman is just flawless; she's above and beyond TV and movies and this Earth.
When Finley gets his vaccinations, it kills me, and you can't protect yourself from that. My heart is being ripped out with every shot. It's a deeper level of emotion that I wasn't prepared to feel, but it's completely amazing. It has opened me up both as a person and as an actress. Everything has a deeper meaning now.
Everyone gives 'Picket Fences' credit for being so willing to delve into issues that now would be no big deal. But it was then. It was ahead of its time.
At this point, I can almost never see myself saying no to a con or a 'Charmed' reunion, because it's so important to so many people I've already met personally.
