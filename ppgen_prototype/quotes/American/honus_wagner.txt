In all my years of play, I never saw an ump deliberately make an unfair decision. They really called them as they saw 'em.
I never have been sick. I don't even know what it means to be sick. I hear other players say they have a cold. I just don't know what it would feel like to have a cold - I never had one.
I won't play for a penny less than fifteen hundred dollars.
There ain't much to being a ballplayer, if you're a ballplayer.
