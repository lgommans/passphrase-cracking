American,Musician
Musical composition should bring happiness and joy to people and make them forget their troubles.
I personally do not believe in politics, hatred, or anger in my musical composition.
I had the house rhythm section at a club called the Sundown in Hartford. Stan Getz came up and played with us.
I'm shooting for longevity. The road is hard on your body.
