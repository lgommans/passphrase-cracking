One thing I always tell people. If you want to be gold medalist, you partner one.
When I'm on the court, I'm a follower.
Badminton is not popular in the U.S. because I think the mentality of badminton has to change.
Coming in as a veteran, I'd like to finish with a gold medal.
Badminton in Beijing is huge - it's one of their top three sports.
If it's not televised, there's no way Americans will know about competitive badminton. All they know is the back-yard thing.
Don Chew is the owner of the Orange County Badminton Club, the location where I train. He played badminton when he was young and always had the passion for it. He never made it at the international level, but he wanted to give back to the sport. The majority of the elite players train at Orange County Badminton Club.
We do the majority of what most athletes do. For example, as a badminton player, you have to be able to run a long distance and sprint. We do weights three times a week.
