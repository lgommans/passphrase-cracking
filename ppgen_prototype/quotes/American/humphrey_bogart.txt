The only thing you owe the public is a good performance.
The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind.
I should never have switched from Scotch to Martinis.
I was born when you kissed me. I died when you left me. I lived a few weeks while you loved me.
A hot dog at the game beats roast beef at the Ritz.
The whole world is about three drinks behind.
Things are never so bad they can't be made worse.
You're not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi.
Well everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out.
I can't say I ever loved my mother; I admired her.
I made more lousy pictures than any actor in history.
The only point in making money is, you can tell some big shot where to go.
I've been around a long time. Maybe the people like me.
Acting is experience with something sweet behind it.
All you owe the public is a good performance.
