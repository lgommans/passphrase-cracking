American,Actor
My first job was a commercial for Ball Park Fun Franks.
The truth is I want to make music that people enjoy.
As soon as things become predictable, they become boring.
New York is a character, all on its own, and whenever you film there, it becomes part of the show. That's just the nature of being there.
I like telling stories.
I keep getting cast as this bad guy, and I don't know why.
I just think Texas and that whole Bible Belt section is so, like, corporate. And I don't agree with organized religion in that respect.
I grew up in Plano, Texas.
People sometimes forget how important Broadway is as a place for young actors to grow.
I'm kind of A.D.D., and so my mind wanders a lot.
Maybe I'm a better actor when I know there's going to be an older woman involved.
I don't even drink coffee.
I cry at the end of every book.
My morals are important to me.
Ultimately, I'm fine with everything that I've done.
I started making music for myself when I was sixteen.
I am such a goody-two-shoes.
I've written probably over 200 songs that have a verse and a chorus and that's it.
My mom grew up in Kansas, my dad in Indiana. They had boring childhoods.
I've never done a blind date but my parents met on a blind date.
I want people around me who call me out and hold me accountable.
