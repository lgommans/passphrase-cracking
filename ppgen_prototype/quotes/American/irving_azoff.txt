I'm proud to be involved with Simon Cowell and 'X Factor.'
The release of 'Chinese Democracy' marks a historic moment in rock n' roll.
Radio stinks. The stations are making a lot of money, but they just aren't taking chances.
Since the traditional recorded-music business models have drastically changed, there is truly diminished income derived from recorded music by artists - both current and catalog. The touring industry has become much more important as a majority revenue stream and the ancillary fan experiences and promotions that may be derived from it.
History shows fans want consolidation; you see it across the web every place. The big players are people like Google, Amazon, eBay, Facebook.
The great thing about Ticketmaster is that it's seen as the comprehensive site for ticketing, artist information, venue information. We're a marketing platform, not just a technology platform, and we're going to build on it.
I can't think of any more powerful moment than when you stand on a stage.
Life at a public company ain't for me. The board pays you what you're worth, then you get reamed for your compensation.
You can't be an entrepreneur and work in a public company anymore.
Recorded music is more a marketing tool than a revenue source.
