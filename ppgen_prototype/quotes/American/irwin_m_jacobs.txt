When we began Qualcomm, it had become quite clear that it was very important to patent new ideas.
While I was at Cornell in engineering, I was an engineering co-op student, and that turned out to be very valuable because we'd go out every other term to work in industry and have that close association with industry.
At Linkabit, we put little effort and energy into patenting things.
We try to preach innovation. We provide resources; we invite speakers in from universities to talk about new ideas.
