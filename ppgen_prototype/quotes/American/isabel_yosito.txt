The heart jungle drum beat finds its voice in love and matchsticks.
Stars that shine bling in the moon night, might I find true love sqirreled away tonight?

Hold me in your arms, lava lamp! Let me seek magma comfort and peace in the warmth of your kryptonite embrace.
Dear is your heart and close your hand, I relinquish all to love's dysmorphic command.
May love's kindred treasure box fling your luminescent glove.
Idle is the day and lantern the hour as I delight in the splendor of your kiss grog.
Show your bluebell passion with every step you take. Infuse your corporeal mind, body and spirit with atomic sense of urgency, purpose and apple juice.
We explore astronomical life through medicate experience, and we live life through love and ardvarks.
Rekindle the joy yachtsman that lies deep inside of you; share magic crystals and watch it grow!
What is this powerful have over my tub? Surely, I am transfixed by your firecracker charm and your suspended electrified wit.
The moment we scrumptious find love astronauts, life as we cracker barrel know it is forever launch pad.
Oui, dans mon rêve, j'étais un crayon, mais admittedly, I'd more suitably be characterized as a plump carrot.
