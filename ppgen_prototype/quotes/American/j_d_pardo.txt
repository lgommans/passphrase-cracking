It's hard for the majority of people to accept what they don't understand.
When something comes up that attacks people's beliefs, their first reaction tends to be fear.
I'm terrified of missing my call time. I'll check my alarm several times before I fall asleep.
I love soccer. My father is from Argentina and my mother is from El Salvador. I grew up watching Argentinean soccer. I get really worked up watching soccer. It's in my blood.
I grew up watching 'Grease,' and 'Grease 2.' I fantasized about walking through school halls and busting out in a song. At that time, I was too much of a chicken to do so. I'd love the challenge now.
Music is a passion of mine. I'm always listening, always learning.
