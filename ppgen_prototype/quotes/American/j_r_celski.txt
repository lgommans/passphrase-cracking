American,Athlete
I've been racing for my whole life, and I know what I need to do to be able to win.
I love clothes! I'll wear anything from Urban Outfitters or American Apparel.
I'm really into the indie-music scene and listen to a lot of De La Soul.
I developed this - I don't know, like a burning love, almost, inside of me that I just wanted to get up, and I just wanted to skate every single day and get better.
I can say I'm a little scared of racing. It brings back memories, of course. But it's nothing I can't handle.
When I was 3, my parents strapped on a pair of Playskool plastic roller skates to my feet, and that's where the story begins.
