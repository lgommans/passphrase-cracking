The whole voiceover world is new and different to me and quite challenging.
That's one of the things that I've loved about 'Spider-Man' and Marvel in general. The characters all have dimension.
I don't want to play earnest. I'd rather play somebody who's kind of sleazy. It's much more fun, especially in a comedy. You don't want to be some earnest guy who's just trying to do the right thing but can't. I want to be doing the wrong thing intentionally.
