I never saw myself as being ambitious, I saw myself as being in love with the profession. I'm a people person. I love to get to know different kinds of people.
The people who knew me and knew my work and trusted me, they knew then as they do now that I've never fabricated or plagiarized a story. People who know me know I didn't do this.
I've never fabricated or plagiarized anything.
Rather than hearing from the city council president, you'd hear from sources all across the country.
This was just one of many times God has spared me.
