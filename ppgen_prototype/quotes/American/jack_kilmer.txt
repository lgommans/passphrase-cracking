American,Actor
I actually didn't always want to be an actor.
I've always been really into movies, and I definitely thought I'd be involved with movies at some point.
I admire James Franco. I admire somebody like Jack Nicholson. Anyone who just does movies for the sake of making movies and takes big risks.
Anything that would kind of label me or put me into a category is kind of what I want to avoid. I like the idea of being completely free, like having no area that I couldn't cover.
With 'Palo Alto' as the catalyst, I've surrounded myself with people that have kind of created a world where I can feel like I'm not gonna be judged for doing something that I want to do.
What goes on between the actor and director is sacred.
My parents always encouraged me to do creative stuff, to do weird stuff.
I was never one to sit down and write a plan for my future.
