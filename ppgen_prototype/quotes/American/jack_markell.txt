So, for me the town hall meetings are really an opportunity to engage in two-way dialogue with people, and they've been very helpful.
My own experience, though, as a business executive and as a governor, tells me that businesses are interested in a lot more than a low tax rate when they decide where to locate.
My focus on the budget, though, has played second fiddle to what I believe is even more important - creating jobs.
The number of business leaders who asked me to lower their taxes can be counted on one hand.
As one of the first employees at a small cellular phone start-up called Nextel, I gained firsthand experience in how a business grows from an idea to a company that, at its peak, employed many thousands.
As governor, I'm spending my time focused in three areas: creating jobs, reducing the expense of government and schools.
But I'm a big believer that government does not have a monopoly on good ideas.
Delaware is the only state east of the Rockies that is allowed under federal law to offer sports betting.
