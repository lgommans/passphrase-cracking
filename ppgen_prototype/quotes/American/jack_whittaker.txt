I won the lottery. I don't care what it costs.
I'd do the same things, but I'd be a little more quiet.
If I had to do it all over, I'd be more secluded about it.
It doesn't bother me because I can tell everyone to kiss off.
I'm simply a businessman who has seen his share of failures and successes.
I know who Jack Whittaker is. And some days I don't like who I am.
