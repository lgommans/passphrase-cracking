I've raised Michael. I changed his diapers when he was little.
I know my brother. Michael, he's not that kind of person. He doesn't do that. That's all a lie on him.
I find Jesse Jackson to be religiously, progressively old fashioned.
One thing of the many things that I know about Jesse Jackson, he is persistent.
My husband believes that he can make a difference. He loves people.
Jesse Jackson, when I met him, he had an innocence about him which is still very much a part of him today.
