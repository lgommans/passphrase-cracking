American,Musician
I don't cry America. I do not cry. That was a once in a lifetime event. I do not cry, do you understand? I don't cry, okay?
The music I love to sing would have to be gospel - it just uplifts me, it takes me to a really good place.
If my life was a song it would be, 'It ain't that easy being green' from Sesame Street.
In my spare time I like to sleep.
The type of music I like to sing is really those classic songs, those Barbara Streisand, Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra, classics.
I prefer to sing in the shower vs. the car. The shower is just steam, you know, its just you, and nature, and no clothing. You know, there's nothing separating you. It's just you, and the voice - you, and the water.
I'm the type of artist who touches people, that's the type of artist that I am.
I hope that America sees that I'm a fun loving guy and I hope they see the light of God in me, if that makes sense at all. This is a great platform, this is a great blessing that I have, and I I just want them to see something in me that says, 'Everything's going to be okay'.
You're going to be entertained. But when you finish hearing me singing, you're going to want to keep going, and you're going to keep believing and that's the kind of artist I am.
