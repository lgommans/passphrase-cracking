I find cooking very sensual. I love getting in there with my hands instead of utensils. With all of the textures and everything, it's very erotic. Also the time it takes to prepare, and the anticipation and the buildup, you know. Then finally, you get to eat.
One of my favorite days, yes. All day, massaging Harrison Ford. That was rough.
Harrison Ford's still got it goin' on. He's very sexy in that manly-man kind of way.
I love sushi, though I just read something about how you shouldn't eat sushi more than once a week.
