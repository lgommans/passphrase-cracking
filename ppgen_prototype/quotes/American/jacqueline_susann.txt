Acting is glamour but writing is hard work, so I'm going to be an actress.
As a writer no one's gonna tell me how to write, I'm gonna write the way I wanna write!
I don't think any novelist should be concerned with literature.
I wanted to write it long before I wrote Every Night, Josephine! I'd been thinking about it a long time.
The second draft is on yellow paper, that's when I work on characterizations. The third is pink, I work on story motivations. Then blue, that's where I cut, cut, cut.
