American,Actor
As far as I'm concerned, the best acting class is life.
There were times when I'd go to lawyer auditions, and everyone's in a suit, and I'm covered in concrete and paint.
Weapons training, how to clear a room - all that stuff is imprinted into me.
I've probably spent a good year and half of my life watching movies. I love it. It was something I knew I'd be happy doing.
I'm not mean. I'm a nice guy.
My military experience... I can recall so many different emotions from that.
