There's something about VR. I'm a super dork and love video games. I've tried some VR things - some have been good, and some aren't. I wouldn't be surprised if the next level of entertainment is VR-based, and when you go to the theater, everyone puts on a VR headset.
It's tricky to get people to go see a movie in theaters today. 'Blair Witch' is playing in D-Box Theaters with the shaking seats. Just think if they gave you a 360-degree headset. Everyone would want to go to the movie.
I remember, after filming that last scene in 'The Walking Dead,' I had nightmares for weeks about being eaten alive. With 'Blair Witch,' I had nightmares as well. But what's scarier about 'Blair Witch' is thinking about what might have happened instead of death.
There's simply no excuse not do a game about 'Blair Witch,' which has everything from the time-dimensional shifting to being chased through the woods. Kind of like the VR website experience where the woods shift whenever you turn.
