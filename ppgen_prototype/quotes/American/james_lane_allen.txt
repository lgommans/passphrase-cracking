You cannot escape the results of your thoughts. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain or rise with your thoughts, your vision, your ideal. You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration.
As you think, you travel, and as you love, you attract. You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.
The outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to reflect their inner beliefs.
The vision that you glorify in your mind, the ideal that you enthrone in your heart - this you will build your life by, and this you will become.
Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bear bad fruit.
A man is literally what he thinks.
All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.
Circumstances do not determine a man, they reveal him.
Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so you shall become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.
He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.
To begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment.
We do not attract what we want, but what we are.
Whether you be man or woman you will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.
Work joyfully and peacefully, knowing that right thoughts and right efforts will inevitably bring about right results.
You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.
You cannot travel within and stand still without.
