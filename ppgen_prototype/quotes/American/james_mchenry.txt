Public utility pleads most forcibly for the general distribution of the Holy Scriptures.
Bibles are strong entrenchments. Where they abound, men cannot pursue wicked courses, and at the same time enjoy quiet conscience.
In vain, without the Bible, we increase penal laws and draw entrenchments around our institutions.
