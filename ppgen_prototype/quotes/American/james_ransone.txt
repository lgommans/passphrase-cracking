American,Actor
I'm such a hater, and will hate on anything.
A lot of my world-view is formed by the places I've been.
I probably don't make as much money as people think I make. I make more than the usual medium household. I'm one of the few middle class actors out there. The microcosm of Hollywood reflects the macrocosm of international finance.
Anyone who lives like a modern aristocracy, the last thing they exhibit is a sense of gratitude. Me, I'm very fortunate.
In my twenties, I was a huge, insane risk-taker.
I'm friends with a lot of Brits, and they tell me when they're over here what a huge phenomenon 'The Wire' has become. Some things just attain critical mass after they're already dead and buried, and I don't know why it was the case with 'The Wire'.
Music is a very, very powerful tool that filmmakers use to sway people into emotions that they intend you to feel.
Animals are a continuous source of inspiration and wonder to me. I would love to play a dog.
