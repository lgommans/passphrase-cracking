American,Actress
Everybody is dealt a hand of cards. It was my choice to play them the way I played them.
I love babies, and I have my nephews that I love. I have a great mom and she has raised three kids, so if I take lessons from her, I think I'll be great. All my friends have little brothers or sisters.
I had a perfect pregnancy and a perfect delivery. I was very blessed.
I would love being the soccer mom.
I just want a healthy, happy baby, so the whether it's a boy or a girl really doesn't matter.
All I can do is be my best - there will always be people who will never like me.
I was a kid who did a kid show. Then I went away and raised my child, and the world has never met me as an adult.
Do people have an idea of who they think I am? Yes, and that's fine with me. My music will speak for itself.
I would like to be like Britney, but maybe better, but I don't wanna outshine her.
I'll probably do a lot of acting first, then go to singing, but I am going to definitely sing someday. So when I do start singing, buy my album!
