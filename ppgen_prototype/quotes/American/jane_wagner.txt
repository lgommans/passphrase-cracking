When we talk to God, we're praying. When God talks to us, we're schizophrenic.
The ability to delude yourself may be an important survival tool.
A sobering thought: what if, at this very moment, I am living up to my full potential?
I personally think we developed language because of our deep inner need to complain.

All my life, I always wanted to be somebody. Now I see that I should have been more specific.
Delusions of grandeur make me feel a lot better about myself.
