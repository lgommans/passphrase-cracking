Comics are about the illusion of movement, and movies are about movement itself.
I have on my bookshelf a book called 'Movie Monsters' by Alan Ormsby, a kids' book I got when I was in kindergarten. It started there.
With a novel, you're the director and the screenwriter and everything else, except that you have to write it knowing it will all be performed inside the head of the reader. So it's a difficult and lonely task.
Stephen King's 'On Writing' is probably the most useful writing book I've ever read.
