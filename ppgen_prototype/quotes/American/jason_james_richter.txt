American,Actor
I've had kids come to me and say, 'Oh, I loved your movie when I was a kid, and I became a marine biologist.' It's crazy.
No one gave a crap that I was the kid from 'Free Willy'. You're not in some wispy fantasyland where everyone's telling you 'yes' all the time, which happens a lot to actors.
To a certain extent, I think I've become an animal-rights person.
