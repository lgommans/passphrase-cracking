People know my background and for people who need an improviser, I'm one of the people they think to use if I'm appropriate for the part.
Maybe it's just my improv and sketch background, but I'm a lot more comfortable in a group. I like sharing focus and populating an ensemble.
A good comedy with a purpose behind it is exhilarating.
When I was a child, I was referred to as the Danny Kaye of the family, because I was always impersonating and mimicking people. I was a song and dance man.
