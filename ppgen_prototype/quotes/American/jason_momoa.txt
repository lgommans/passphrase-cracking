American,Actor
I love life and if there's something that I'm playing that I love, I'll research it.
I'm a huge art buff.
I'm raised to actually think, to use my brain.
I love carbs, but denial is good training for the mind.
I think a man needs to be a man. To hold a woman the way she wants to be held. Just do whatever your woman wants, and you'll be fine.
I'm not a big fan of just doing weights. Anything more physical is infinitely better.
I'm kind of ADD in that sense where if I start liking something, I'll just learn it to the absolute max.
I grew up rock climbing.
I'm half Hawaiian and the haka is a very sacred thing, something your family teaches you - my father taught me.
I'm not a barbarian.
I was born in Hawaii, but I was raised in Iowa.
I'm one of those freaky people that actually reads books.
My favorite movie is 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.'
I grew up with artists.
I got called 'pretty boy' my whole life.
