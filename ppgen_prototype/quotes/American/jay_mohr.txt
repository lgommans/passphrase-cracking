You know how to tell if the teacher is hung over? Movie Day.
I think I made a mistake once... yeah... it was only once.
I wasn't the guy everyone liked. I was the guy that wouldn't shut up.
If it has to sell its mascot, your team sucks.
If it doesn't know what to charge you for nosebleed seats, your team sucks.
I never minded George Steinbrenner spending obscene amounts of money to put the best product on the field.
I hate golf. I do not understand how anyone can enjoy it, much less love it.
I wonder why there is a designated hitter in baseball after all these years? As an experiment, it seemed like a swell enough idea, but you would think the novelty would have worn off by now and everyone would get back to playing baseball.
True Yankees are born, not made.
Fantasy football is not only a good thing, but a great thing.
Unfortunately, there are no mulligans when it comes to pro football contracts.
Not everyone likes sports. Gandhi and Malcolm X come to mind.
When human beings stop progressing at an endeavor, they stop enjoying it and move on to something else. Not golfers. Masochists, all of them.
Why are baseball managers the only coaches who dress up like the players?
I think golf is a waste of time and a waste of a sunny afternoon. I also stink at it. I have never found anything, including divorce and a sexual harassment suit, more frustrating.
I was the youngest kid on my street, the youngest comic in the clubs. I always felt like I was playing catch-up. I was very angry.
But if applause throws off your timing, then you're not the kind of comedian I would like to see. All you have to do is stand there and take it.
I'm oddly not competitive. What I love about show business is there is a home for everyone.
Marc Maron's podcast success has nothing to do with my podcast success. If I do a quarter of a million downloads, I can show that to an advertiser as a fact, and that's that.
