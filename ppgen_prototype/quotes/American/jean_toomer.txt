People mistake their limitations for high standards.
Talk about it only enough to do it. Dream about it only enough to feel it. Think about it only enough to understand it. Contemplate it only enough to be it.
We learn the rope of life by untying its knots.
No eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their sight.
Most novices picture themselves as masters - and are content with the picture. This is why there are so few masters.
Acceptance of prevailing standards often means we have no standards of our own.
Fear is a noose that binds until it strangles.
The realization of ignorance is the first act of knowing.
Men try to run life according to their wishes; life runs itself according to necessity.
I am not less poet; I am more conscious of all that I am, am not, and might become.
