American,Actor
If I can tell my story, and help anybody else in the interim, then that's icing on the cake.
Hollywood can be a very stinging town. They say it's a forgiving business. It's not that forgiving.
In 'Taxi,' I kept doing the same scene for three years. I was underused.
My life is pretty much an open book.
I don't know where actors go after they die, but I know people who help other people have a nice place to go. And I would like to go there if I can.
I don't want to live in a fantasy world.
I got very depressed. Hollywood can be a terrible place when you're depressed. The pits. I decided I had to change my life and do different things.
