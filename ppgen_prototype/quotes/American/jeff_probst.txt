My goal was, and still is, to write first, direct my own stuff whenever possible and control my own creative destiny.
The thing that surprises me most is, you cannot change who you are.
In Survivor and Finder's Fee, it is about what you would do if you could get away with it. Survivor is about your own integrity and where you draw your own ethical and moral lines. There are no rules.
Everyone wants to talk, you've just got to find a way to get them to talk.
Reality is a genre that seems to be here to stay. I don't know how many of the new shows will last, but the more competition you have, the harder that pie is to slice up.
Most people I run into say, I haven't missed an episode. Either you like Survivor or you don't, but if you do, you're a loyal viewer.
I'm not one of these guys who says, Now I'm on a really hot show, better quit soon before I get labeled. That's the most ridiculous notion I'd ever heard.
Survivor is like rock 'n' roll - you can do what you want.
There's something to be said for embracing who you are.
Every day I get more and more honest.
I feel good about the work I do on Survivor and am proud of my contribution.
