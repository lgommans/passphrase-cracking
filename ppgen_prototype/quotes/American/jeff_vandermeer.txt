I do believe very much in the idea of unexpected or 'convulsive' beauty - beauty in the service of liberty.
I have always tended toward a lush prose style, but I take care to modulate it from story to story and to strip it down entirely when necessary.
Film fixes a precise visual image in the viewer's head. In fiction, you just hope you're precise enough to convey the intended effect.

There's also a lot of gritty Americana type of bands. I actually have a lot of Britpop on my iPod, too.
The music I listen to while writing is really scene-specific. It's just a great motivator, a way to put myself in the mood.
My mother is an artist, and I have a strong visual sense. I almost always choose the cover art for my books. I've learned that the more I collaborate, like by having someone do a soundtrack to one of my books, the more I see my own work differently.
