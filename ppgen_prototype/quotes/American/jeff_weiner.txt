You have to maintain a culture of transformation and stay true to your values.
Managers will tell people what to do, whereas leaders will inspire them to do it, and there are a few things that go into the ability to inspire.
Facebook is massive in scale and scope. Twitter is a public communication forum, but if I'm following you, you're not necessarily following me. LinkedIn is, simply, a professional network.
In order to inspire people, that's going to have to come from somewhere deep inside of you.
I've come to learn there is a virtuous cycle to transparency and a very vicious cycle of obfuscation.
Prioritization sounds like such a simple thing, but true prioritization starts with a very difficult question to answer, especially at a company with a portfolio approach: If you could only do one thing, what would it be? And you can't rationalize the answer, and you can't attach the one thing to some other things. It's just the one thing.
You don't necessarily have to go public to get to the next level.
Going public for the sake of going public is not really an optimal thing. You're going public because as a company you believe it is the right thing to do and it will benefit the ability of the company to achieve its long-term objectives.
LinkedIn is increasingly becoming a very strong place for companies to develop their talent plans, their recruitment plans, and so there are ways in which we can track some of the momentum there.
