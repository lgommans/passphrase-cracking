What I love most about animation is, it's a team sport, and everything we do is about pure imagination.
Shrek is not like anything anybody has ever seen before.
I have a very difficult time getting the Napster world.
A company like DreamWorks, all we do is make product. That's all we do. We don't own distribution. We are purely in the creation of content.
Every single thing you see on-screen came out of somebody's creativity. It doesn't exist. Nature didn't deliver it to us. Everything had to be dreamed.
I haven't got a lot of patience.
I know what we do really well - I just try and keep us focused on doing that.
I love to look at The Graduate, or Lawrence of Arabia, or things I had nothing to do with. But you could not get me to go back and watch movies that it was a privilege just to be around them when they were being made.
Inspiration comes from all different places.
It was the business that made Pop go away, not our inability to create.
Since we made Shrek in the digital format, you actually can see it in its purest form digitally.
The entire exhibitions industry in the United States of America has filed for bankruptcy.
The thing that's changed the most has just been the rapid technology.
You can tell when an actor or actress cares about their work. It's really clear.
