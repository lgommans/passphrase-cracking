I find it valuable to watch what I do. I like to know when I'm making a choice if it actually works or not.
I've kind of had to make a career of playing villains. In order to stay employed, I had to figure out how to play bad guys.
All actors are looking for that role that's going to define who they are. When it happens, it's a good thing.
The joy for me of television is the sort of family feeling of being involved with an ensemble - the cast and the crew and the director of photography and the guys in the camera truck - and you're all coming together. There's a great feeling when that is a successful unit, a successful family.
I think that it's fun to get the script and open it like a Christmas present. That's 'Alcatraz' or anything that I'm working on. If the groundwork has been laid too much, the surprises aren't there.
