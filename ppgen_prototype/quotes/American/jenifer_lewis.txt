American,Actress
A diva is someone who pretends to know who she is and looks fabulous doing it.
I don't have any beauty shop memories. I remember the barber shop.
You are a black goddess when you come out the salon.
I've been burn when it comes to my hair that it ain't no joke.
But a true diva has dismissed that drama. A true diva's heart is open, and she's ready to play by her own rules - rules that are gentle and kind.
If you can find something you love, go for it everyday of your life, and it would be really good to you.
We didn't have a beauty shop as I grew up.
Saturday night is when my hair would be fixed up and that was my memory.
I want to co-produce again.
Apart from being Jennifer Lewis. The name pulls people in.
Sometimes I think I take on a lot of work but that's me.
I'm in the moment. I'm always in the moment of life.
It's important to e alive in those moment, especially when you're doing something you love to do.
America has a relationship with Bobby and Whitney.
What if Whitney was at her top, and we brought in a name like Whitney Houston, it would sell.
I had not starred in an independent film and it's about a woman who owned a hair salon.
You never know when you start a project just how good it can be.
I still go to a salon where a gal does my hair, and I don't know if it's because I'm a celebrity but by the time I leave there, we are eating chicken and talking and screaming.
If you don't love it, don't touch it.
If you just want to be a star, go away.
You have to be a star to be in this business.
Whoopi and I have been friends ever since she claimed she couldn't sing on the set of Sister Act.
You think you can go into all those auditions not knowing who you are? The work came after I found my sense of self - when I wasn't so manic and desperate.
