As we have always seen here in the U.S. the universal truth about elections is that people vote their pocketbook.
For our part, the U.S. must act quickly to ensure Most Favored Nation status to China.
Our country is not in crisis; there are no tanks in the streets. No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life in America will go on. Our lives will continue to be filled with practical matters, not constitutional ones.

The death tax destroys family businesses and stifles investment that leads to increases in jobs and personal income. As a result, 70 percent of family-owned businesses are not passed on to the next generation and 87 percent do not make it to the third generation.
Only with our government are you given a certificate at birth, a license at marriage, and a bill at death.
Our baby is safe, and it's just a house.
