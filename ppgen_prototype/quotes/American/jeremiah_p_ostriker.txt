If you take a galaxy and try to make it bigger, it becomes a cluster of galaxies, not a galaxy. If you try to make it smaller than that, it seems to blow itself apart.
Biology has tended to be an observational science, and deriving things from first principles has not been possible in the past, but I hate to predict the future on that.
