American,Actor
I worked selling tickets for Dodger Stadium; I delivered pizza; I did every job under the sun. It's the part that sucks as an artist. But I've learned at the end of the day you just have to enjoy your life.
A lot of people just look at acting as a quick fix - they don't have a work ethic. This is a job; it's not all margaritas on the beach.
The definition of success to me is not necessarily a price tag, not fame, but having a good life, and being able to say I did the right thing at the end of the day.
I don't think of myself as a New York actor; I think about this guy who's an actor who happens to be from New York.
All I'm going to say is that I worked with Christopher Walken the other day. I can cross him and working with Clint Eastwood off my bucket list!
In college, I would just drop out of all my classes, and I would just be left with my acting classes.
I knew if I had to struggle, I couldn't struggle in New York. My ego was too big for it. I couldn't be a guy who is starving when I had a very successful business when I was young.
For me, personally, I'm a 5'5" leading man. I'm no Brad Pitt or anything.
When I'm on set, I never really get intimidated by people.
You've gotta play the Hollywood game, and you know you're doing good the more notoriety you're getting, and that's gold. That's what every actor wants because then you know you're at another level.
I don't mean this to sound cliche, but it's really about the work for me. I like to keep working on things.
