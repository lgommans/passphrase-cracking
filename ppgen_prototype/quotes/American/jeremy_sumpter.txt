It's just certain people that I get the giggles with.
If I had my own Neverland it would probably be the coolest place in the world. You could do anything you want there. There would be trees everywhere.
When we were filming, I thought that I was Peter Pan, you know? I thought I was the coolest kid in the world, so I wound up being the coolest kid in the world.
San Francisco. The one team that everyone in LA hates.
It's different hearing girls I don't even know scream my name.
I want to have a bunch of kids so I can boss them around.
I definitely want to do movies and stuff.
Movies are great, TV is great.
I get recognized a lot now. It's great.
I thought I was the coolest kid in the world, so I wound up being the coolest kid in the world.
One lawyer told me that he never drinks water or eats in front of the jury because they can't do either one.
My memory's bad!
It's always special when you're young and you have a vision for something you want to do, and somebody takes a moment to connect with you. Now if there are kids on the set I try to talk to them for a bit.
If the weather's nice, I like to be outside exercising, but when it's colder, I'm a real homebody and I catch up on my reading.
That's the scary part about TV, how you'll feel about it in six years.
I have been accused of making people laugh, maybe when it's not appropriate, during scenes.
