Put simply, the Bush administration policy in the Middle East is continuing to fail.
Howard Phillips of the Constitution Party asked me to consider seriously running for president in 2008 and I am doing so.
If the Republican Party continues to ignore its conservative base, then the Party is headed to oblivion.
I don't believe in the moon landing conspiracy theory. I don't believe in Big Foot.
