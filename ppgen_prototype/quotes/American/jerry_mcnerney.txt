American,Politician
I spent 10 years working on a math Ph.D., and I finally got kind of good at it.
I spent more than 20 years of my professional career researching and developing renewable energy sources.
In 2004, I ran for Congress and lost. In 2006, I ran again and won - defeating Richard Pombo, a seven-term Republican incumbent.
People come to me with their passion about transportation, about education, about health care, about agriculture, the dairy industry, the almond growers. I'm just a kid in a candy store, learning and eating up all this different knowledge.
I enjoyed like nothing else working in pure math, discovering new formulas.
