American,Comedian
During the Great Depression, when people laughed their worries disappeared. Audiences loved these funny men. I decided to become one.
I ask myself why I do it. Maybe it's to prove I'm still around. It takes a lot out of my body. I'm not an NBA player anymore. At my age, very few people can handle it.
Anne is very forgiving. She doesn't care about money, being rich, or clothes. We never argued about finances.
Creative comedy is like growing geraniums in a mine field.
My father and mother - I figured if I could make them laugh, they'd stop fighting. I stole all their material.
I shave without using shaving cream.
Never go for the punch line. There might be something funnier on the way.
It can make you sad to look at pictures from your youth. So there's a trick to it. The trick is not to look at the later pictures.
Money is sensual.
Being on a sitcom stops me from getting Alzheimer's.
Hollywood never knew there was a Vietnam War until they made the movie.
I've been around the block a lot and I've had a merry trail for 55 years.
I loved the idea of touching base with an audience.
The worst thing in this business is to be thought of as a no-talent.
Anne hated the idea of putting me down in front of the audience.
Some of the routines come back very easily. We do it off the top of our heads.
We managed to hang in there. Today when people get married there's a tendency to run away when things get tough. There is a lot of strength in hanging together.
I don't think my judgment is that good. I don't know what is funny.
