It isn't as important to buy as cheap as possible as it is to buy at the right time.
There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side.
A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong - not taking the loss - that is what does damage to the pocketbook and to the soul.
