American,Actress
My father and I used to watch movies all the time. That was our bonding time, so that's when I kind of fell in love with acting.
I'm sure fame is yet to come; however, it's not my ultimate goal. I really just want to be able to tell stories, and create, and do it for a living.
I was a huge fan of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
