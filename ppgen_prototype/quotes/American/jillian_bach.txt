David Duchovny is a dream; a dreamboat and a dream. He was so kind... He held my hand after we were done shooting and told me I did great. He's so good at what he does.
I think, being an actor, it's just a relief every time you get a part.
My personal advice is to go to school first and get a liberal arts education, and then if you want to pursue acting, go to graduate school.
The challenging thing is that we go home after doing the run-through and the writers stay there working, so sometimes I get script changes delivered to me at midnight. It's constantly shifting.
TV is so seductive with a great workday. You're going to work and making people laugh, and that's fantastic.
We film in front of a live audience, and I was a theater actor before I got into television, so I like that.
