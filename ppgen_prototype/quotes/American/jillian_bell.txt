American,Comedian
I love playing idiots. I love very weird, confused women.
I always knew I wanted to do comedy. I like making people laugh.
I've been very lucky to work with people I think are funny and who are really awesome human beings.
These actors like Danny McBride and Jonah Hill are so good at improvising, and when they do it, it's this fun moment for the audience. It makes them feel like they're watching something fresh and new.
I definitely had an AOL account when I was 14, but I don't remember what my screen name was.
I started doing improv when I was 8 years old, so it's always been in my life. I would feel naked without it.
I am so excited about the 'Goosebumps' movie; I am geeking out. I was a huge fan of the books.
I actually bedazzled when I was younger. I totally did that to my jeans.
