American,Politician
George W. Bush is a leader, and that's what we need in the White House. George Bush is someone you can believe and trust.
I was always accused of being too stiff. In 1974, when I ran my first primary race for state rep, I was chief aide to the speaker of the House, I knew the issues and understood state government. But what I found out the hard way is that you can know all the ins and outs but people want to know you, your family.
I was hesitant to go around and shake hands, just go up and stick my hand out to strangers. Then I learned to stick my hand out.
I spend time in the classroom. I think more of them aren't political science than are political science. I particularly like talking to journalism students.
America has been a beacon of hope for vulnerable people throughout the world.
