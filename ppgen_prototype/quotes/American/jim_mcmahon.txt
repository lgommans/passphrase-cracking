I am normal. In fact, I think I might be more normal than anyone else.
The Packers have lots of owners nobody knows instead of one owner who doesn't know squat.
Short term memory is not good.
I've been hit in the head so many times, it's hard to remember that far back. I don't remember specific games.
My memory's pretty much gone.
There are a lot of times when I walk into a room and forget why I walked in there. I'm going through some studies right now, and I am going to do a brain scan.
I think you're put here on earth to enjoy yourself. And I'm doing that.
I don't like the rules about you can't hit the quarterback.
I don't know who had it out for me, but somebody did.
