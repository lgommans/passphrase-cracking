Nutrition makes me puke.
I asked my doctor how many more years I have left and he said, 'You're too ornery to die.'
I feel great. I had a triple bypass in 1976 and a quadruple bypass in 1984.
I'm the gooney bird that walked to the bank. I'm doing better than most of those guys who said I was crazy.
I've had 117 fights and that's the first time I've ever won.
If you want to talk to me, you'll have to put out that cigarette.
Probably the best thing that happened to me was going nuts. Nobody knew who I was until that happened.
We should have won the pennant that year. It was the best club I was ever on.
You touch me and I'll kick you in the rear.
I didn't get hurt in the contest. I hurt it the next day.
I didn't mind if they yelled at me, but when they came on the field, it was a different story.
