As I've grown - dare I say it - older, I had hopes of indulging my dreams of being a sailor.
The creative processes are so mysterious.
You reach a certain point in your life where they things you do and say do make a difference.
The people who are making money are the ones who are writing and singing their own songs.
I like words. I like the way they clash around together and bang up against each other, especially in songs.
When I started out, I was absolutely awful, I had no voice, I didn't have a lot of stage presence and most of the interpretive intensity that I brought to the experience was actually terror.
When we go somewhere in New York, I'm known as Mr. Savini.
I've been fortunate that when Frank Sinatra was in concert, he would say, 'Here's a song by a wonderful young songwriter, Jimmy Webb,' and I'd be in the front row and stand up. That gets people talking about you.
It's very hard for me to think about my songs and attribute some significance to them.
Particularly in my early days, I did very little rewriting.
I think it's prima facie evidence for the existence of God because for me to grow up and actually end up working with Glen Campbell is almost unbelievable.
I believe strongly in inspiration, inspiration literally meaning 'full of the spirit.' I do believe that it comes to you.
I rode all around Hollywood listening to Donna Summer, looking out the window - all by myself - just going, 'I'm number one!' It's a pretty extraordinary feeling.
