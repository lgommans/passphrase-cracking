American,Actress
There's a lot of weight on the shoulders of a single parent, and that's taken a lot of energy away from me. It was always in the back of my mind that I had to do it, and I couldn't count on anybody. There was no one around to pay for me to get through life.
Every job you do, you gain more experience. You never stop learning.
I think I scare people. I really have to watch myself.
It used to be such a stigma, making that transition to various entertainment medias. There are a couple of actresses who have cut it quite well, and I consider myself one.
I don't mean to be trite about abortion, but I do feel it's a woman's body, and I don't think anyone should take away her choice of having or not having a child.
I'm a mother lion when it comes to protecting my children.
It's been a funny life for me. Sometimes I feel I haven't done a lot of living.
