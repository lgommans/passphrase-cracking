American,Musician
I think we should all come together, and that race and color or social demographics really don't matter.
You can be young and still have views and opinions.
If anyone will listen I will continue to sing.
I'm afraid of animals.
I think every little girl is fascinated with mermaids.
I love being creative.
I look up to people who succeed in accomplishing their dreams.
I bite my fingernails. That's probably not a good thing.
Everything I listen to is influential in some way.
