I did make some not-so-great relationship decisions when I was a lot younger. I do know that not all high school boys are great and wonderful and Prince Charming, and there are a few that are going to treat you that way.
I love the whole lingerie outfit - you know, thigh-high tights and garters.
Action scenes get me so excited, and my adrenaline starts pumping.
You should have seen me in my Catholic school girl skirt with my knees knocking together.
I eat very clean, healthy food at all times because I'm very focused about keeping myself in shape.
I don't think there are beautiful women out there trying to lure men into any kind of conspiracy. I think people are out there just trying to meet someone new and interesting and live in the real world.
I am very hands on doing my own work, all my own stunt work.
My home in Dallas is wonderful. I can walk everywhere. It's a pretty good hidden secret, Dallas. There are wonderful restaurants and a wonderful nightlife. It's just a beautiful city to be in.
I'm trying to broaden my range and get different characters in each film.
I'm deathly afraid of rats.
A lot of the time the film chooses me. I'll be working and I'll get a call from my agent and I'll get the script and then tell him what I think.
