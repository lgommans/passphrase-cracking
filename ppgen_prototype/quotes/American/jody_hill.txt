American,Director
Like, I'm a big fan of films from the '70s, like Cassavetes and things, where they just keep the dialogue really loose and just kind of roll, you know what I mean?
I don't see myself making comedies always.
I like writing my own stuff. If a book came along I would maybe do that.
I really like Larry Clark's films, as weird as that is. I like Richard Kern films.
I grew up doing martial arts, and it's one of these things where I always kind of liked acting, but I was never real serious about it.
I did little theater things growing up.
I'm not really trying to be too much of an actor or anything.
