Showing up to games year after year, no matter what the product on the field gives you back, is a learned behavior - sort of like rats in a maze searching for cheese. The rat learns the maze, learns where the cheese is placed and eventually goes to it without thought, even when the cheese is taken away. The rat doesn't know anything else.
I'm not the kind of guy who will pass someone without saying hello. If that's flaky, then I guess I'm flaky.
Even rats can only be kicked around for so long before they've had enough.
I'm a slow starter, but it's time to flip on the switch.
If I see someone down, I'll try to give him a good laugh.
I have a personality. The fans like a guy with personality.
