When they get a 50-inch waist and a gorilla butt, it's ugly looking - and I think bodybuilding has become ugly looking.
To keep it simple you run your gym like you run your house. Keep it clean and in good running order. No jerks allowed, members pay on time and if they give you any crap, throw them out. There's peace where there's order.
It was the highlight of my life being in the Mae West show, because I saw and did things I never had before.
Gold's was the first bodybuilding gym made for bodybuilders.
They came from all over the world to work out at Gold's Gym.
I nicknamed everyone in the gym. It was easier than remembering their names.
I couldn't pronounce Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I called him Balloon Belly.
That's the object of going to a gym, having fun.
I've been very lucky in my life.
Everybody thinks that I did this and I did that, but I just went along with the times.
