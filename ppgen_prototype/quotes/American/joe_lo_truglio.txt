American,Actor
You surround yourself with amazing, grade-A talent, and you're going to have to lift your game. You kind of thrive just by being around such people.
The people from 'The State' are close friends, but also some of the most incredibly funny people I know.
There's shorthand that happens when you work with someone you know where you can almost finish each other's sentences. There's just a certain back and forth that becomes much easier with someone you've worked with for so long.
I hope that I have gained the reputation of being someone that would do anything. I think that that's an admirable reputation to have if you're an actor.
I grew up down in Florida, and in the Keys, there's this place called Sea Camp which was not unlike Space Camp, except you explored the sea. And so that kind of whetted my appetite for that. But then I ended up swimming in a lagoon full of Cassiopeia jellyfish, and that quickly quashed that desire to be a marine biologist.
I was a big 'MAD Magazine' fan when I was a kid, and I read a lot of horror comics - I illustrated as well.
