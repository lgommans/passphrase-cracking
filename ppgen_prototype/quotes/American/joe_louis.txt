American,Athlete
You need a lot of different types of people to make the world better.
I made the most of my ability and I did my best with my title.
I don't like money, actually, but it quiets my nerves.
Once that bell rings you're on your own. It's just you and the other guy.
Every man's got to figure to get beat sometime.
When I was boxing I made five million and wound up broke, owing the government a million.
