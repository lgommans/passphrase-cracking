Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.
When you drop any new idea in the pond of the world, you get a ripple effect. You have to be aware that you will be creating a cascade of change.
The ultimate function of prophecy is not to tell the future, but to make it. Your successful past will block your visions of the future.
The invention of the micro-loan was a big surprise to me. Who would have guessed loans of less than $20 made to poor people in undeveloped countries could create thriving local economies? And, even more surprisingly, that they more reliably pay off their debts than the wealthy of the world.
A leader is a person you will follow to a place you wouldn't go by yourself.
When you think about it, if the fittest always won, all forests should be completely homogeneous. One species should supplant all others as the most superior competitor. But it doesn't happen that way. Nor does it happen that way in the marketplace.
Those who say, 'It can't be done,' are usually interrupted by others doing it.
Your successful past will block your visions of the future.
The past guarantees you nothing in the future if the rules change.
Usually the first problems you solve with the new paradigm are the ones that were unsolvable with the old paradigm.
