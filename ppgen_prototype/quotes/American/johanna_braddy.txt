American,Actress
I'm kind of scatterbrain and all over the place at times.
I grew up on classic Nintendo, which was amazing. My best friends were hardcore into it.
I'm really low maintenance for a girl. I pretty much shower, attempt to fix my hair, throw on some mineral make up, and go.
I make a sincere effort to do some form of exercise every day, except for Sunday. That's church and hang out day.
My must-have hair products are Phyto silk spray and Kusco-Murphy setting lotion.
If you don't love acting more than anything else, don't do it. It's not a normal life. It will take you away from your family, friends and life in general.
