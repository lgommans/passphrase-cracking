The real universe has a marvellous and unique quality, inasmuch as it and only it can take us completely by surprise.
On balance, I would say that anybody who reminds our lords and masters that the computerized society is fragile... has definitely done a service to the public at large.
The same computers that make it impossible for you to cheat on your income tax can ensure that the blood of your group is in the ambulance that picks you up from a car smash.
I have always found fact infinitely more interesting than myths and falsehoods.
