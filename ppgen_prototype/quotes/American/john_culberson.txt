Foreign nationals entering the United States illegally who are taken into custody by the Border Protection Corps or by State or local law enforcement authorities must be promptly delivered to a federal law enforcement authority.
This is not the first time that Mexican authorities have handed over an Arab from a country with known Al Qaeda connections to a local sheriff across the border. FBI picks them up and disappears.
The sheriffs are completely outnumbered and outgunned. And we don't have enough border patrol agents.
The border sheriffs are locally elected. They're accountable. They know the territory and the people. And they can respond the most quickly to what is a real national security emergency, because the border is unprotected.
I'm going to vote in support of the president of the United States in keeping the troops in Iraq until the president and our military is convinced that the mission is complete.
Federal authorities do not have the manpower or the resources to protect America's international borders.
Eligible citizens from any State in the Union can serve in the Border Protection Corps of that State.
