I look at trees, hunt mushrooms, and watch animals. Fishing is what gets me out into the woods so I can notice these things.
Spinning yarns is a protection against the nuttiness... the greed, the hate all around us.
I'm a fisherman who likes to observe and tell yarns, and so I told stories about things that I knew about.
I listened to a lot of stories when I was a kid. My mother told me stories, and I loved them.
