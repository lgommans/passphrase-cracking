American,Actor
Acting was always something deep down I knew I wanted to do. It wasn't, like, a normal profession to want to pursue, and I knew that.
Making a living doing something you love is my idea of happiness.
I always had this curiosity about acting, but I was really into sports, and I never really thought about acting as a career. My senior year, I tried out for the high school production of 'The Wizard of Oz,' and that was it for me.
My mom is, like, my unofficial publicist.
Ever since I was a kid, I loved being up in front of people. I loved making people laugh; I never had any stage fright.
I'm more an actor who can dance and sing if I absolutely have to. I studied theatre in college, but I studied drama, but I don't have that Broadway voice, and I'm not a trained dancer or anything like that. I identify mostly as an actor first and foremost.
'Braveheart' is one of my favorite movies, and to be part of an epic sprawling period film is on my bucket list: something with some grandeur to it, a really awesome score, something that's just kind of moving, you know.
