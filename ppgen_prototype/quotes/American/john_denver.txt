Things go up and down. If you can survive the down, it will come back.
I believe that we are here for each other, not against each other. Everything comes from an understanding that you are a gift in my life - whoever you are, whatever our differences.
Peace is a conscious choice.
I think the biggest problem in the world is that we have a generation of young people, and maybe two, who don't think it's going to get any better.
My purpose in performing is to communicate the joy I experience in living.
I would so much like young people to have a sense of the gift that they are. Not many of them feel like that.
Heck, I'm no Henry Mancini or Michel Legrand. I just play the guitar and write songs.
I've had a deep love affair with skiing for many years.
I was never trying to write a hit. I was just trying to write good songs and get a message out, and it was my great good fortune to be popular.
I just play the guitar and write songs.
It's a great big step for me to open my heart up even a little bit.
We must begin to make what I call 'conscious choices', and to really recognize that we are the same. It's from that place in my heart that I write my songs.
We don't teach kids how to feel, we don't give them the words to go by.
I get an awful lot of fan mail, and I read all that I can.
I know I'm incapable of orchestrating an entire film.
I don't want to just entertain people. I want to touch them.
At times I've got a really big ego. But I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, if they say I was Annie's husband and Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough.
I think more about the family now. That's an interesting progression for me.
Divorce is just the most awful thing in the world.
