American,Actor
I'm not a gambling-man. I have never bet a dollar in all my life.
Part of my strength as an actor comes from what I've learned all these years: when you play a villain, you try to get the light touches; when you play a hero, you try to get in some of the warts.
The only way to quieten me is to invite me to a tennis match.
Once you drink one glass, you want another.
I always said life consists of love and work. I tried to balance it 50-50. And, of course, now I'm so happy I did.
I figure there are a few actors like Marlon Brando, George C. Scott and Laurence Olivier who have been touched by the hand of God. I'm in the next bunch.
It's rather amusing at my advanced age to become a sex symbol.
