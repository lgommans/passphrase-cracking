When I read 'Rocky V,' it was a terrific story, a great script. Rocky died at the end. He has this devastating fight with Tommy Gunn, ends up in an ambulance with his head in Adrian's lap, and by the time they get to the hospital, he's dead.
My dream was to have my own advertising agency by the time I was 30, and that was before I got into movies.
I thought boxing was stupid.
