American,Poet
Tradition wears a snowy beard, romance is always young.
For all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these, 'It might have been'.
All the windows of my heart I open to the day.
The best of a book is not the thought which it contains, but the thought which it suggests; just as the charm of music dwells not in the tones but in the echoes of our hearts.
I'll lift you and you lift me, and we'll both ascend together.
You don't always win your battles, but it's good to know you fought.
Give fools their gold, and knaves their power; let fortune's bubbles rise and fall; who sows a field, or trains a flower, or plants a tree, is more than all.
Before me, even as behind, God is, and all is well.
Peace hath higher tests of manhood, than battle ever knew.
When faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is dead.
One brave deed makes no hero.
From the death of the old the new proceeds, and the life of truth from the death of creeds.
It is no use trying to sum people up. One must follow hints, not exactly what is said, nor yet entirely what is done.
God's colors all are fast.
As a small businessperson, you have no greater leverage than the truth.
Beauty seen is never lost, God's colors all are fast.
The smile of God is victory.
