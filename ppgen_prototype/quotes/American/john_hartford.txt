The whole universe is based on rhythms. Everything happens in circles, in spirals.
I'm like a child trying to do everything, say everything and be everything all at once.
The best way to express rhythm is music.
Time is the most important thing there is. That is the only element that you can't withdraw from the situation and still have the situation exist. Everything depends on time.
After you start learning all about the mechanics of piloting a riverboat, you stop seeing all the pretty sunsets and you start thinking about the weather.
You read about somebody, and it doesn't really matter whether or not they really exist - the point is that you get into them like real characters.
