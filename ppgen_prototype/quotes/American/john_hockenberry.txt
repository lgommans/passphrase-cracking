Design is the courage and brilliance to cover an original and make it different.
An object imbued with intent - it has power, it's treasure, we're drawn to it. An object devoid of intent - it's random, it's imitative, it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
I think everybody in news understands that the audience that watches for more than an hour is not your target audience - because those people are on life support.
In general, I think very few people have a sustained interest in news.
The media doesn't need a conscience; people need consciences.
I think every journalist understands when they are the beneficiary of hot information that, yes, they have a scoop, but they're also being used. Part of your responsibility as a journalist is to tell the story of why that information is coming to you, consistent with the ground rules of your sourcing.
