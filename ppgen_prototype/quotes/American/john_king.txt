American,Journalist
We're very good at telling what happens and showing people while it happens... But sometimes television fails to take the time to say 'Why did it happen? What does it mean?' - To step back a little bit.
I do not subscribe to the advocacy journalism school. It's not who I am and not who CNN wants me to be.
Sometimes you feel sad to be left out of a big debate.
The world has changed. People have amazing access to whatever they want, whenever they want it.
I always joke that a makeup-free day is good for the pores.
There is a lot of noise and conflict in our political discourse, which is fun to cover, but I'm convinced from my travels that people also thirst for more details as well as insight and context.
I've covered a couple wars and a lot of breaking news and a lot of cops-and-robbers situations.
I work for a place that's been great to me over the years, and when you make a mistake, you're hurting your company as well.
I had the traditional print view of TV journalists: Those are pretty people who get paid a lot of money and don't do any work. It turned out I was wrong.
I miss the ocean; I miss Fenway.
