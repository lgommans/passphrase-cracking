Positioning the brand and regaining trust are all smart things for us to do and those are the litmus tests for any decisions we make.
We are looking for development partners, people to work alongside us, which will accelerate our actually getting licences, the technology into product, into the markets.

Technology has been, and always will be, my one true passion professionally.
You want to find a place where, because of your skills, you can make an impact.
What people want is a seamless Web experience.
