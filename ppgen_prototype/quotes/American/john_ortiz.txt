American,Actor
I'm becoming more of a Jets fan, and 'Hard Knocks' has a lot to do with it. I like Rex Ryan. You know what? I'm going to give up the Cowboys. I'm now a Jets fan.
If I had to pick a favorite album, 'El Malo' would be one of them. That music is good old-fashioned medicine.
I feel blessed. I never wanted to be an actor. It just happened all by chance and fate. I was studying to be a teacher.
