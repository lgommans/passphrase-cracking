I'll never get a Humanitas Award, but I'll have fun.
When I die, I want it to say 'Short and Funny' on my tombstone.
Seattle was a rabid film town in the '70s and '80s because it rained so much.
I love 'Love Actually' and particularly the story with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. I think it's possibly the best exploration of infidelity that's ever been done because it really feels accurate and real.
It's nice when you're working in Hollywood and there's a movie you'd like to see that no one is making anymore. You make it yourself.
How do you deal with giving yourself the options in the editing room for dealing with problems that come up from a shifting tone? It's trying to convince your actors to give you the genes and several versions to have more options in the editing room.
I think 'A Serious Man' is genius.
Actors come in, and they have their own take on things, and you have to adjust on the fly to make sure everything still works structurally and dramatically.
I'm a huge fan of 'Kung Fu Panda.' I honestly think that Jack Black's voice work in 'Kung Fu Panda' is the best voice work that's ever been done. He's so funny, and it's such an endearing character. It really is great.
