Even now, most people call me Joy or Joe Lee or Joey. It's all fine with me. The only time I correct them is when they refer to me as Spike Lee's sister.
I was not raised to be someone's wife. I was raised so that things should be evenly distributed.
I considered myself one of the boys. My brothers didn't spoil me at all, not at all. I was very tomboyish. It wasn't as if I was like a princess or anything like that.
My mother passed away when I was 14, so there were certain things I missed in terms of upbringing. Maybe my mother would have said, 'You have to get a real job.' I don't know because I didn't have that experience. My fortes in school were Spanish, sports, reading and theater. That's what they encouraged.
Acting is something I always wanted to do and knew I could do.
