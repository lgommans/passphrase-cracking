American,Actor
I mean, I hate when actors talk about how hard their job is. It's ridiculous, because we have the best job in the world.
Let's just say I'm a physical guy.
If you can figure out how to get paid to do something you love, that's the dream.
I think it helps, as an actor, to never know when you're going to get that next script and you're done.
I'm not a big shopper.
I did come to L.A. to try to get on TV and get in front of a camera, so I could have a stage career in New York.
I played baseball in college, and then I went to Russia to study acting and played some pro ball over there.
I don't tweet.
I played sports in high school and in college.
Bugs have always loved me.
You know, I love the South.
I've never been a big gore guy.
