Everything about playing a villain is appealing to me.
Growing up, I would have to say I loved 'Peter Pan' because I was fascinated by Captain Hook; I was fascinated by Hans Conried, who was an actor on screen and also a theatrical and television actor.
You have to realize that when I started to work on 'Aladdin', Disney Theatrical wasn't in existence. I suppose I had always hoped that 'Aladdin' would be somewhere on the runway.
If you look at the Disney Villains, I think you'll find that they do have mass appeal in some way, and it usually has to do with a voice quality that also matches very well with the animation.
It's a very big collaborative effort to do an animated feature and to do a Broadway show.
I always think the villains in all of the Disney movies are almost operatic in scale.
I grew up on Disney movies and, as a kid, I always liked the villains.
As theater artists, it's a great luxury to have time.
