Make sure that you always follow your heart and your gut, and let yourself be who you want to be, and who you know you are. And don't let anyone steal your joy.
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that it's meant to take you.

We didn't have a glee club at my school. It depends on what area of the States you're from. It's more in the Midwest.
I was born and raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania - in Amish Country!
I went to a local high school in Lancaster. Not much I can say about it; it was pretty much your typical public high school back in Pennsylvania.
