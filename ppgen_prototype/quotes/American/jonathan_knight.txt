My belief is that you live your life by example, and not by a caption on a magazine!
I have lived my life very openly, and have never hidden the fact that I am gay!
My fellow band members don't discuss their loved ones, and I don't feel that just because I am gay, I should have to discuss mine!
If there ever has been any confusion about my sexuality, then you are someone that doesn't even know me!
I have never been outed by anyone but myself!
Apparently, the prerequisite to being a gay public figure is to appear on the cover of a magazine with the caption 'I am gay'. I apologize for not doing so if this is what was expected!
I just always had this feeling inside me of always being nervous and afraid of situations.
From 1994 to 1997, I did nothing. I slept and slept and slept. If I was awake, I had to deal with things, I had to do things. In order to avoid that, I would just stay in bed.
I was always doodling house sketches.
I want to be around people, not crickets.
Even when the band got back together in 2008, New Kids fans knew I was gay. Everyone did.
The whole New Kids thing was crazy. The more it grew, the more I just felt like I was trapped.
Being in a relationship grounds you. You feel a sense of home.
I hate heights, that's the most terrifying thing for me.
I kind of live my life as an example, and I just never felt like I had to be on the cover of a magazine announcing that I was gay; it's just who I am. I just live my life, and I never really thought about it.
I hope that I can be an inspiration to kids that are young and may feel different or may feel like they don't belong.
