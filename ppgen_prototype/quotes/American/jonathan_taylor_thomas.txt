I can't tell you how many shows I've done with full-blown migraine headaches.
Success is not in never failing, but rising everytime you fall!
It's difficult to have any animosity towards someone if you recognize that on so many levels they're exactly the same as you.
An education is a more surefire guarantee that you have possibilities opened to you.
I think at this point, I'd eventually like to work behind the camera. That's not to say I would never act again, I'm not quite sure to be honest.
I wouldn't recommend young kids see 'Speedway Junkie.' It's definitely an age-appropriate movie - dark and realistic and edgy. If young kids want to see me, go see the Christmas movie.
