Positivity, that's one of the things I try to spread throughout my company and really anyone I come in contact with. Because as you know, life's too short. You got to keep it positive and keep it fun.
My family came from Ecuador.
Don't be afraid to adapt new ingredients into your own techniques, and traditional ingredients into new recipes.
As long as you remember what you love and why you love it, it will never be far from your heart - or your plate.
I studied cooking in Spain after college.
Some of the best cooks that I've cooked with, whether it's in New York or Chicago or even here in Philadelphia, are actually Ecuadorians. And there's something about their palates that really just inspires me, and has a really deep sense of flavor.
Well, you know, for me, I think Spanish food is festive.
If you were a Colombian, you would have your version of an empanada. If you are an Argentinean, you might find a dough that's baked and has a butter sheen on it. And then in Ecuador, you'll find more crispy-fried empanadas. So, yeah, every culture has their own version of empanadas.
I think that a lot of us at home are iron chefs in their own right in that we have to come up with meals real quickly.
Chicago is a lot of my background as a chef.
There a great ethnic cuisine available to you in Chicago.
Being Ecuadorian is, I don't want to say it's tough but it's... something special to me.
From the time I was 8 until now, I've been working. My Social Security is looking solid.
I spent several years cooking on a line.
I have experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth, and I feel incredibly lucky that I'm able to make a career out of doing the things that I love.
I'm a huge fan of burgers, and they're not my wife's favorite, so we don't cook them at home.
