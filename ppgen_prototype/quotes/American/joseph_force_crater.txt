American,Judge
The truth of the matter was that I made myself disappear. I never liked being a Judge, so I just decided to start over. Sorry to inconvenience anyone.
I've been around doing a little of this and a little of that.
I never saw the play, although I heard it was good.
I heard that you did not have a judge to interview this month in the Bulletin, so I thought I'd help out. Besides, with the Stock Market tanking recently, it reminded me of the good old days.
Later, I became the manager for Amelia Earhart, until, well, you know.
I used my aviation contacts to open a travel agency. I used to book Caribbean flights.
I always enjoyed politics. I worked at the White House recently, primarily for the First Lady. Because of my experience running my travel agency, I was in charge of the files she kept on the Travel Office.
