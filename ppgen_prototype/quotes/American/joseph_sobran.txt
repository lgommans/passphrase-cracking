American,Activist
Politics is the conspiracy of the unproductive but organized against the productive but unorganized.
The most fundamental purpose of government is defense, not empire.
War is just one more big government program.
Most Americans aren't the sort of citizens the Founding Fathers expected; they are contented serfs. Far from being active critics of government, they assume that its might makes it right.
Freedom is coming to mean little more than the right to ask permission.
