American,Musician
After 'Rock Star,' I was definitely doing more high profile gigs. I was playing in Iceland. I was playing in Canada.
I want to be living out of a suitcase in a different city every day.
I like to think of my style as pretty versatile. And I'd like whatever I record to reflect that to be mostly genre - to be just something that people want to listen on to see what I'm going to come up with next. That's the kind of music I'm into.
