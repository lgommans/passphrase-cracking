American,Actor
I hate people saying anything stupid. I don't really suffer fools very well at all. When people are acting like idiots, not that I'm not guilty of doing the odd idiotic thing myself from time to time, but when people say stupid things, it stresses me out.
For me, the desire exists less to get myself a degree than to just go and have the whole college experience, and throw myself into the brain pool and see if I can swim.
I'm of the opinion that life doesn't always tie up neatly at the end of the episode.
If I only dated actresses, I'd be a very lonely man.
I'm not really the type to wear my heart on my sleeve. I would let someone know if I liked them, but it takes a while for me to fall in love.
I've had more of an opportunity to work with Katie Holmes, which is incredibly enjoyable. I think she is really one of the best actresses on the market right now. She forces you to bring your best stuff to the table, because if you don't, she just completely overpowers you.
Uma Thurman is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. She has those wicked eyes - it looks like there is such a brain behind those eyes.
The anti-elitist values in America, I think, are very destructive to education.
I love Vancouver. I can be with my family, I can reconnect with the guys. It will always be my home.
Nobody criticizes the 'Mighty Ducks' trilogy and gets away with it. Nobody!
Maybe it's due to my west coast liberal upbringing, but, the idea of parallel universes doesn't strike me as being too far out there.
Most people call my style of dress slovenly, I call it extreme casual. If I didn't have a mother and a sister for the times I do have to get dressed, I would be absolutely lost.
I think Uma Thurman is one of God's creatures, one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
