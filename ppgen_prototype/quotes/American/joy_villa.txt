Go big or go home. You can either stand for what you believe or fall for what you don't. Above all, make a choice for tolerance and love.
I believe in love above all.
The spooky thing is that two weeks before the Grammys, I wrote down my goals, and one of them was, 'To be on the top of the Billboard charts with a song I wrote and performed.' ... It's completely unheard of.
My friend, singer Kaya Jones of the Pussycat Dolls, told me she could finally come out of the closet and wear her Trump 2016 campaign shirt.
I am 100 percent a Trump supporter. I believe in his message. I believe he will run this country like he runs his life: successfully. I stand as a proud American, and I stand for a unified America that is tolerant of each other no matter who we voted for. I stand behind our President because that's the American thing to do.
I voted for Trump, and a lot of my friends did as well. And we felt like we had to be closeted, we had to be quiet about it, or we would face a backlash and bullying, and I just got tired of the narrative of hate.
