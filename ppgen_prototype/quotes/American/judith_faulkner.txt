I get so many requests for interviews. If I talk to everyone, we can't do our job with our customers and work on our software. It would be hard to stay focused.
I was an undergrad math major and a grad student in computer science. I'm hugely introverted, not atypical of math majors.
One of the things that made Epic strong when I wrote the original code was that it never occurred to me to do anything other than put the patient at the center. I developed a clinical system at a time when the health care world had pretty much only billing and lab systems available.
Health care organizations don't ask us to interface to every type of module because they understand that it could cause safety problems.
