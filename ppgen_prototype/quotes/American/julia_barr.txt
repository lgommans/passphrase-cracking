American,Actress
Sometimes I think it's better to be a diva.
When you see something that is well-written, the actors can get behind it.
This profession has fed me creatively and allowed me to have a home life and a private life.
Working with my husband, I thought we would be at each other. As close as we are, our styles are so different. But it didn't happen - we were surprised.
I don't have a directorial overview, which sometimes is very helpful.
I know my husband really loves me because he takes me to have ribs. He says I'm the only girl he ever took out who actually ate anything on her plate, as opposed to pushing it around.
And I've had vocal training on and off for years.
We love to be with our family and friends and I can tell you that lots of eating will be involved.
Don't know about a cabaret act right now, would actually prefer a role in a broadway musical.
No one is ever really dead unless we find the body.
The CD is dedicated to our dog Nell, who passed away last year.
I get paid to not laugh.
Always wanted to be an actress or work with animals and now I get to do both.
I am a makeup junkie... Yves St. Laurent, Christian Dior, and anything else that looks good.
