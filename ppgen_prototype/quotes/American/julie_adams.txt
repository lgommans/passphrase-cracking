No matter what you do, you can act your heart out, but people will always say, 'Oh, Julie Adams - 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.'
Who could have asked for anything better? I was cast in movies with great actors, with great leading men.
It was a great learning experience to work with James Stewart.
I remember so vividly playing a scene with Jimmy Stewart. I was in the back of a covered wagon, and we were doing this little talk in the wilderness. They did his close-up first. I was looking at him and thinking, 'How does he do that?' He is not 'doing' anything, and yet everything is there.
