American,Author
I've written about superheroes. I've written about talking ferrets and math geniuses being chased by madmen. I've written about spies and demon-hunting soccer moms. I've created an entire world that centers around a paranormal judicial system.
There are a lot of wonderful books out there that aren't marketed properly, and readers who might love them never even know they exist.
I absolutely adore writing books with paranormal elements - and I love creating the often-complex worlds and/or plots that go along with those stories - but at the heart of all of that ,you have the characters, and when you get down to the core of it, it's spending the time with the characters that is what I truly love.
I know authors shouldn't play favorites with books, but 'Release Me' really is right up there for me. The characters truly came alive on the page and drove the story as much as I did from behind the scenes. It was a pleasure to write, and I'm so thrilled that it's the first of a trilogy because I get to spend more time with the characters.
It's that drama that drives authors, you know.
I try not to think about the trope or whether or not my books are like 'Fifty' or 'Crossfire' or any other series.
Bantam has an incredible team working on my books, and I'm so thrilled that the art department is so amazing, since those covers are the 'face' of my stories!
I've never listened to any of my audiobooks, but I'm very, very happy that they've received such excellent feedback from readers!
If the characters are acting true to themselves, then that chemistry and suspense will flow.
My characters populate a big, vibrant world. Sometimes they rub shoulders. Sometimes they don't.
'Dirtiest Secret' is Dallas Sykes' story. And it is a stand-alone trilogy that readers can come to completely fresh.
