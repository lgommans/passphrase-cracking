I always say whoever can figure out how to make ice cream healthy will be a gazillionaire.
As for restaurants, I'd say I'm always down for Wendy's. A little fry dipping in a Frosty - that's a good deal.
If I could be a country music star, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'd hit the road and just jam out.
I would love to do something on the other side of the world. I'd trade places with some guy on a ranch in Australia and see what that's like for a day. Somebody with different ideals and things that I would probably take advantage of.
I'm a procrastinator. That's a pretty bad habit.
I get up in the morning and I kind of go, 'Man, I feel like going on a five mile run!' And the thing for me is I enjoy running... I understand what maintenance means, and maintenance means you have to do cardio, but the most important thing that you have to do for your body as you get older is you have to eat right.
I find it very endearing when a girl is dorky because it takes a very brave person to act that way in front of people. And in every girl that I've been attracted to, I recognize the dorkiness about her because I think I have some in me. That makes me feel a lot more comfortable with her.
I love to sing, but I'm just terrible. I play guitar, and I play enough where I can play most country stuff, and I'll sing when it's just me.
