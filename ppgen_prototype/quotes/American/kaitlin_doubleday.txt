The business breeds such a deep insecurity. It's the nature of the beast, and there is nothing you can do to get away from that.
Actors in general have some place in them that can be sensitive and easily damaged: not damaged in a bad way, but insecurity, because that's what it breeds, especially in females and female-lead types.
My favorite thing about this business is you're just jammed in a room on a set with like-minded people - writers, directors, and art designers and hairdressers. People who didn't work a 9-to-5 but chose this life. You're going to like at least two or three people in that you love these people so much.
I was thinking of going to college or staying in L.A. to act, and I stayed to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. I've had a lot of wonderful experiences - some horrible ones, but mostly really beautiful ones.
