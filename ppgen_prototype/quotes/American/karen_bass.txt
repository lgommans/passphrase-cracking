American,Politician
I think that women are much more collaborative; men are much more competitive.
It's so much easier to throw rocks than it is to govern.
When I was in my early 20s, I studied tae kwon do and hapkido. I earned brown belts in both of them.
You know, I was a community activist, so I'm used to standing out in front of an elected official's office and protesting.
My father was from the South and turned me into a news junkie at a very early age. I would sit and watch TV with him.
I have been a lifelong community activist and frankly did not dream of being in public office.
