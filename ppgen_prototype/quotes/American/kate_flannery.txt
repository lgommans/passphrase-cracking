American,Actress
I do have a lot of female friends who are stand-ups and also women who are actresses and also happen to have an act.
I think the whole concept that women aren't funny is dead. It's over; it's done.
I love Tig Notaro; I just think she's so awesome.
Well, one of the things I love about 'The Office' is that it has so much heart.
I think comedy is funnier when it's real.
I think the genetics of being Irish are that you sort of prefer when it's rainy and cloudy. It's just genetic.
I feel like I'm the luckiest actress in the world.
I cannot believe that in all the years that there have been female stand-ups, there has never been a show just for them.
'TV Guide' is smart to aim toward women. More women will go there to find out what's on - just like when guys won't ask for directions, a woman will break out the map.
It's easy for people to strike if they're not working on a regular basis.
I feel like people are funny, and women are people, so I'm sick of the distinction.
Obviously I've gone out of my way in my career to not look good, so it's always nice to, every once in a while, get the opposite going.
