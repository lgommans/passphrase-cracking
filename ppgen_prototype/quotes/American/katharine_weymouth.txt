American,Publisher
My mother doesn't cook; my grandmother didn't cook. Her kids were raised by servants. They would joke about Sunday night dinner. It was the only night she would cook, and apparently it was just horrendous, like scrambled eggs and Campbell's soup.
I don't feel like my job is to be beloved.
I certainly hope to be a great publisher, and if people want to love me, too, that's even better.
Women are often meeker in meetings and afraid to ask for raises and promotions. I've told countless female colleagues to stop apologizing when they ask for more. It's not personal, it's business.
Hillary Clinton famously talked about how raising a child takes a village. Except our society isn't set up that way. We're organized in nuclear units, and a single mom can ask her friends only so many times for help picking up the kids.
Part of my job is to make the tough calls.
I care deeply about journalism, but we need to be a business.
We're no longer a newspaper in the morning, we're a 24/7 newspaper organization.
Moderate to conservative Democrat. But I'm not going to impose my views on the editorial page.
I think I felt like a regular kid. Growing up in New York, I never felt I was a big deal.
My grandmother knew J.F.K. and L.B.J. That was her world. I enjoy meeting interesting people. But that's not my world.
I don't personally feel that I have to save democracy and journalism.
The way I live is really me.
It's not like I pretend the past doesn't exist or that I'm not proud to be a part of it.
People assume that I came back to Washington because of the 'Post', but the truth is less romantic. I came back for a job.
