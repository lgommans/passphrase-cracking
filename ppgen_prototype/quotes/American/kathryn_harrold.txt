American,Actress
I'm always saying I won't get involved with an actor again, but then I realize how silly that is. The men I meet most often are actors.
I don't see any reason why I couldn't have a child when I'm 40.
I think I'm going to end up as one terrific old lady!
One of the reasons I moved to New York was because I thought it would be easier to say no to dreadful scripts. I wouldn't be tempted to fly back and do them. There are some things even I won't do.
I haven't had a great deal of luck with my career, have I? Maybe because I'm not pushy enough.
