American,Actress
I know how to tell a story to a thousand people. Sometimes I don't know how to tell a story to a piece of tape on a wall and a camera.
You can go to the Internet and know more than your mom in two seconds. It's crazy how fast teenagers have knowledge and information these days. So, I think it's harder to say, 'Your father and I know more than you.'
I really feel that the thing that I love the most about my career is that it is so eclectic. You know, I've gone from so many genres and so many different mediums and I love that most - that people have always given me the chance to do vastly different things.
I love singing and I think I have a really nice voice, but I don't think I have an unbelievable singing voice. I think I have a great character voice.
I love characters songs and I love to fit into a story. I love singing through a character's journey.
I would love to go back to Broadway.
I don't feel like I need a break from the theater, ever.
I love the theater so much, and it's where I feel most comfortable. I love the people and the community.
My two favorite musicals growing up in were 'Annie' and 'Sweeney Todd,' and my best friend and I would sing all the songs when I was a kid.
