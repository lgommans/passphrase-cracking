American,Actor
What has been happening more lately - of course, I also put in my bio, I say I do the voice of Goliath, but some people go - you know, I say something, and it's a funny thing when you work in this business, people will talk out loud in front of you like you're not there.
Actually, I wanted to be an actor when I was two years old.
And it has some weight, I mean, the whole history of the gargoyles, that's some wonderful stuff.
But Gargoyles, bar none, is the most fun I've ever had in life.
I am working on my nightclub act, definitely want to do more singing.
I came out singing, the doctor slapped me on the head, and I started singing.
I don't think they're going to pay me to play Mufasa.
I loved old movies as a kid, so I always watched old movies.
In fact, I have never met anyone who didn't like Gargoyles.
It can't hurt, publicity is publicity, controversy and all that, it's all good.
My whole life, I always wanted to be an actor.
Well, you know, I played Mufasa in the workshop of The Lion King.
