American,Actress
I've been lucky enough to play some funny, nasty ladies in my day, and if you can make them foolish, they're even funnier.
I accredit animals for keeping me going when times were bad.
I do have a mouth - I will say. I speak up when I see things I don't care for.
As much as I love to dance, and I still take class, aerobics and that sort of thing, and I still move very well and all of that - I'm really not a dancer anymore.
It's always a thrill to walk through a Broadway stage door.
I love stage actors. There's something special about all people who have to do a performance eight shows a week, and musical people, especially, are so much fun.
There is nothing more joyful to me than hearing a live audience laugh. Especially when I planned it that way!
