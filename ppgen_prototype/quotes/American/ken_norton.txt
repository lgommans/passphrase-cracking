Ali had a break that was an inch and a half long, and you keep getting hit as hard and as much as I hit Ali, the pain would take over and you would pass out.
I lost my edge for boxing, I didn't put as much into it as I did before. I didn't run as far. I didn't train as hard. I didn't eat correctly. I started drinking a little bit every now and then.
Hitting Ali in the body or on the arms was like hitting a piece of cement.
When I talk to youngsters today, especially those involved in athletics, I tell them to get their education first.
