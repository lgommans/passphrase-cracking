American,Politician
We have a system that allows us to manage a free and fair election, free of fraud, free of intimidation, and that's what we delivered on election day, and we're very very proud of it.
We have 45,000 square miles of geography in Ohio.
And I'm very proud of the 50,000 poll workers and election officials who delivered a free and fair election.
And we have the most scrutinized election system in the United States, and we have met every test.
I am running for Governor of the great state of Ohio and welcome your support.
I have nothing to do with counting the votes.
I would anticipate that the Electoral College will be held on the 13th of December, and our 20 electorate votes will go to the certified winner.
In order to spur economic growth we need to put the brakes on out of control spending, lower Ohioans tax burden and create a most efficient and effective government.
Job creation requires a business friendly environment with a tax structure that is not punitive and a state government designed for efficient use of fewer tax dollars.
Once they ask for a recount, we will provide them with a recount.
The fact of the matter is that they are entitled to request a recount. We're entitled to give them a recount.
The reason it takes us from November the second to December the sixth to certify is because we have a very tedious, very comprehensive process where we audit by precinct, across the state, every vote that was cast to make sure that every vote that was legally cast is counted.
They know, the courts know, the people know that they have no way of changing the results as it affects them.
They reality is that we have 70% of our voters use a punch card system that I tried to change and that bipartisan resistance in the legislature stopped.
You know, Jesse Jackson is just trying to stir up a hornet's nest.
