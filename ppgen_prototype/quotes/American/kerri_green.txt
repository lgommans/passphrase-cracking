I had a chance to get used to the lights and the camera without all that pressure to... emote.
I try to think of school - this is going to sound awful - as something I do in my free time.
It is so unexpected, it goes beyond my wildest dreams. Sometimes I just sit back and think. 'Oh my God, I'm in the movies!' It still hasn't sunk in.
I have always wanted to work with Steven R. Monroe, and when I read his script, I was blown away! I think 'Complacent' hits a nerve that people try so desperately to avoid, which is what I love about Steven's work.
