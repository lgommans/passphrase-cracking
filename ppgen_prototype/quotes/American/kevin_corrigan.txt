I've had many idols growing up. The inclination for idol worship comes naturally to me.
I've had many idols growing up. The inclination for idol worship comes naturally to me. Or it did, anyway. I think I've gotten over it. It came as naturally to me as wanting to act.
There are a lot of actors whom I love, who personalize their work. I want to know everything about them, like De Niro, like Gary Oldman.
I don't really pretend to know what's going on, but I've been immersed in the excitement of watching sports, particularly football. I like baseball, probably more than football.
When I was working on 'Big Fan,' I didn't really feel like any lines needed to be changed or enhanced or expanded upon in any way. I thought it was a solid script. All you had to do was what it said.
Inspiration can come from anywhere. But I do love actors. I wish I could drop a bunch of names, but there are just too many.
