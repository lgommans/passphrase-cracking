American,Actress
Everyone's been on a ramen noodle diet once or twice.
I like the intimacy of independent films and I like the idea that people aren't being paid necessarily as much money as some one on a studio film.
Everyone always asks me, 'Do you want to be famous... ' I never really thought about becoming famous. I just want to work, to be able to put out inspiring and good film and TV.
I love movies, I love television and I know that the kind of stuff I love to watch and that's what I want to do.
With any modern relationship between a man and a woman, everyone - including their own friends - assume that they're going to hook up.
I probably wore out my VHS copy of 'Office Space.'
I'm a huge fan of Asian cooking in general. I love shabu shabu, and I love hibachi. It's kind of like an experience as opposed to just having something in front of you and you eating it.
I'm really proud of this show I did called 'I Just Want My Pants Back.' I was very proud of my work on the show and such a huge fan of everybody involved.
