Tomorrow is not promised to any of us.
I was told I would never make it because I'm too short. Well, I'm still too short. It doesn't matter what your height is, it's what's in your heart.
Everything has been written. Everybody knows everything about me. There are no secrets. Except the skeletons in my closet.
