There's a lot of people that have great ideas and dreams and whatnot, but unless you're willing to work really, really hard, and work for what you want, it's never going to happen.
I am living my dream because I get to work with my kids and watch them find their happiness. It's so rewarding - we brainstorm around a conference table and have a really great time doing it.
Costco is a passion. Costco is like a massage.
I worry about my grandchildren because the Internet can be brutal.
I raised my kids kind of old-fashioned - if you don't have something nice to say, then don't say it at all. I teach love, acceptance, and tolerance... I sometimes think that this generation is lacking in decency.
I love the creative process and being able to build something out of nothing.
I have learned to be ready for anything - and be there for my kids. That's what life's all about.
I guess if I get a little weird about something that isn't the way I want it, and I complain, then it's called controlling.
When my kids are happy, I am happy.
When I was young, I loved shopping at a store on Rodeo Drive called Lina Lee. Shopping there made me feel so special.
I'm strong enough and have a pretty thick skin, but when people go after my kids, I just hit block-delete, block-delete. It's my mantra.
Oh, my goodness, I am obsessed with Costco! We do runs at least twice a week. I love the salmon and rotisserie chicken, the dog beds.
I like everything a certain way. I'm not somebody who can just lay back and let it happen... And I think that's what's gotten me to where I am in life.
