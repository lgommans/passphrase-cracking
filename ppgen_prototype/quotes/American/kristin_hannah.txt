What I know now about life is this: your mother is a part of everything you do and everything you are.
The hallmark of my books is the relationships that define women's lives.
We women. as glue for the family. lead lives that are important and conflicted. What we women choose to give up for our families is important and valid.
I can be a little OCD when it comes to my writing.
I am such a Pacific Northwest girl.
Whenever I write about motherhood - and I write about it a lot - I am drawing on my experiences as a mother and also my experiences as a daughter.
A romance novel focuses exclusively on two people falling in love. It can't be about a woman caring for her aging mother or something like that. It can have that element, but it has to be primarily about the male-female relationship.
Sitting around and waiting for your muse is not the best choice.
