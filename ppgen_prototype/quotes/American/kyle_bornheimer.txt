For a year, I was the world's worst assistant to a talent manager. I was awful at it. Really disorganized. Just not the person you want at the front desk of your office.
I don't find that I subscribe or believe in many rules about what comedy is and what makes it funny.
In high school, I tried to cook dinner for a girl, and it was horrific. It was at her house. I was trying to make pork chops with my mom's recipe, just trying to be Mr. Awesome, like, 'Yeah, I cook, too.' But I just burned everything. There was smoke everywhere.
Even when they have a star that they're going after, casting directors love, if anything, just the excuse to see people. They like to have a dugout full of actors that they can go to.
I've been at this a long time, but commercials are what hit for me. Casting directors watch those commercials.
My dad had a huge movie collection. So we all had a good sense of entertainment history. I was a Jack Lemmon fan more than most people from my generation.
I played a waiter on 'Will & Grace,' a waiter on 'Medium' and on 'Weeds.' They all got cut out. I'm an awful waiter in real life. Maybe I was an awful waiter on screen, too.
