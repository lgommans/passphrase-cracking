You never know where life is going to take you. So everything I do, I just take it one day at a time, and it always leads you to the right place.
I just like to hop up on the dance floor and do my thing.
I support Children's Hospital of Los Angeles through Disney Channel and Britti Cares International in support of children with various diseases and illnesses and donate my time with pride and dignity.
People have been watching me since I was eight. They've been watching me grow up, so they feel that connection with me.
Working with animals forces an actor to work harder because you have to be quick when it comes to improvisation, and you can't break character - at all.
My brother, Chris Massey from 'Zoey 101', was acting first at a young age. I just followed in my sibling's footsteps.
