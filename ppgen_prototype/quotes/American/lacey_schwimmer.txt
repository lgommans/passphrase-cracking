American,Dancer
If I'm dancing, or teaching, or having a family I would want to live life to the fullest as possible.
I like having curves - I'm proud of them!
I think on a bucket list for a performer is definitely doing a stage show, whether it's in Vegas or on Broadway or whatever.
I've always danced. I've always been around it.
Dancers have always been a kind of background image, we've always danced behind an artist or we've danced in a movie behind the actors. We've always been very secondary.
I've had every hair style imaginable.
I think being sublimely happy is the only thing I could ever hope for in life.
Swing dance has been a part of my life since I was born.
