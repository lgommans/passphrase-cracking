Finding your style is like putting puzzle pieces together.
'Antiques Roadshow' is my favorite show. Every Monday night I have one hour of appointment television. I get the popcorn out and tell my husband, 'Don't bother me.'
I love charity thrift stores. Amazing one-of-a-kind pieces at terrific prices, and all the money you spend goes to a good cause.
I absolutely love American folk art, can't get enough of it.
I love going to tag sales, to auctions.
I think the reason I love 'Antiques Roadshow' is that it is sort of like the lottery. There's the chance a regular Joe could walk in with anything and come out close to a millionaire. There's the thrill of the find.
If my daughter has a bad dream and wants to get into my bed, I'm a sucker for her sweet face and warm body next to mine, so I let her jump in. I should tell her to go to bed, but secretly I love it.
A mom has to be ready for anything.
Being on TV is similar to being an athlete. You get no second chances.
After college, I went into the NBC Page Program. It's one of those great programs that allows kids to get their feet wet in every area of the business.
I try to be athletic.
If I don't eat something after I work out, I get shaky and cranky - not a good combination when you're a television host.
I always recommend rewiring vintage lighting. It's not a bargain if your house burns down.
It's not a bargain if it has bedbugs.
