A nonfiction author has to bring a platform with him - radio, a TV show or some kind of recognizable vehicle to help launch them. And the agent is really necessary to represent all of the business interests of the author.
I'd only been in the business three or four years, but I told myself that someday I'd like to be Mort Janklow.
If the books are selling, the money will follow.
