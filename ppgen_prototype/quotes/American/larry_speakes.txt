You don't tell us how to stage the news and we don't tell you how to cover it.
Those who talk don't know what is going on and those who know what is going on won't talk.
Being a press secretary is like learning to type: You're hunting and pecking for a while and then you find yourself doing the touch system and don't realize it. You're speaking for the president without ever having to go to him.
I would dodge, not lie, in the national interest.
