I personally don't even try to compare New York and L.A. To me, they are just way too different.
I've always gone for the more sensitive, bookish guy, totally. The jock boys, the sporty guys, I don't know... they just didn't do it for me.
When you go in and guest-star on a TV show, they already have their family - everybody pretty much knows everybody, and everyone sort of has that base already formed.
Statistically, Portland, Oregon has the most street kids, like kids that run away from home and live on the street. It's like a whole culture thing there. If you walk around on the streets, there are kids living on the streets, begging for money, but it's almost like a cool thing. They all just sit around and play music and squat.
The Internet is so big that no one can control anything, really.
