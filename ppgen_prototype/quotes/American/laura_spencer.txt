American,Actress
I graduated from the University of Oklahoma, and I got the opportunity to take some on-camera classes while I was in school and met a casting director who informed me quite a bit before my move out to L.A.; it made L.A. feel possible, coming from Oklahoma and not having a family that was in the industry.
When you get to the point where you know the material so well and you know the character so well that you can just sort of play off of whoever your reader is - that's the best feeling at an audition.
Auditioning is an entirely different part of what we do as actors.
You could give the best audition ever and not get the role or not get a callback because you just weren't what they were looking for.
