Fear has been a big battle, it runs rampant in my sport so I love to overcome that, to challenge it head on, because there is nothing that feels as accomplished as overcoming a fear, and something that has blocked you in such a big way.
I love overcoming challenges and fear.
There's nothing like overcoming something that scares you so much. Nothing feels better.
I love chocolate chip cookies - really anything with chocolate will do!
There are a lot of eating disorders in our sport, so I try very hard not to get consumed by all that.
I was vegetarian for a long time, and in the last four years I started eating chicken and fish. I feel like it really built up my strength a lot.
The women are stepping up their degree of difficulty more than the men. A lot of us do the same dives as the men now.
I definitely want to win a gold medal, that should be everybody's goal.
I want to do my hard dives really well, I want to see what my true potential in this sport really is. I want to grasp that.
I think there's nothing that can drive you more than a huge dream or a huge challenge.
