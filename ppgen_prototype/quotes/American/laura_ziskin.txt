American,Producer
I describe myself as someone who was always putting on a show, even when I was a little girl. I wanted to be an actress but I liked organizing everybody and putting on plays. I was a producer.
What's great about making movies is the sort of additive process of bringing people together and having an idea and watching the idea be added to and at the end you have this thing.
For me as a filmmaker, I do the projects I'm really excited about.
You know I'm proud that I was able to develop and produce movies that I wanted to make.
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004.
When I was diagnosed I didn't know how epidemic cancer was. You find out that everybody you know is touched by this disease.
