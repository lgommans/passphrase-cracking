American,Musician
I didn't lose. I got second. That's still winning. How could I be unhappy with second place? There are a million people who would love to be in my position.
I knew Scotty was going to win. At the beginning of the episode, I was like, 'Scotty, are you ready to win?'. I knew he was going to in my heart. I accepted it. I couldn't pick a more perfect person to get second place to. He's my best friend.
My favorite type of music to sing is a crossover between country and pop.
I like to sing in the car with the windows rolled down and hair blowing all over my face.
I hope each week I grow and impress you guys and make you happy.
I hope I'm exactly what America is looking for, I don't know, I'm just going to be myself and hope that they love it. That's all I can do.
He might be my boyfriend. He might not be my boyfriend.
