American,Novelist
I get up at 7:30. I grab a canvas bag and go out. I say hello to the people in the supermarket and liquor store. I buy the 'New York Times.' I go to the beach and think about characters and plot.
At 2, I start preparing fish or chicken for dinner. I don't drive. I don't have hobbies. I have no desire to travel.
Writing is the most important thing in my life - above marriage.
I'm not Gore Vidal or William Buckley.
