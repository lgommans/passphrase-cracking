Decorating has always been my hobby.
I've always been interested in art, architecture, color.
I think there's nothing that makes you happier than to be really involved in something. I can't imagine a totally idle life.
Regrets? I think everyone has regrets, and people who say they haven't are either liars... or narcissists.

My childhood taught me nothing... zero.
One can't help but be a bit melancholy when you see how the world has changed, and I don't mean that nostalgically.
When I was married, I didn't work. When I had my children, I didn't work. But before that, I'd work for Diana Vreeland at 'Harper's Bazaar.'
I think grieving is the same for everybody that lost someone you love deeply. It's the same. You know, you're really no different than anybody else who's lost somebody they adored.
I eat like a horse; sometimes I think I must have cancer.
If I see an orchid that's fantastically expensive, I'll buy it. It's worth it, for no other reason than it gives me pleasure.
Divorce is a 50-50 thing, and it can be a number of petty things that finally drive you out of your mind.
Marriage is an extremely difficult relationship.
