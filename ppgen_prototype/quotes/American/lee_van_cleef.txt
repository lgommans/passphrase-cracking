American,Actor
Being born with a pair of beady eyes was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Bad guys have always been my bag... I look mean without even trying.
Audiences just naturally hate me on screen. I could play a role in a tuxedo, and people would think I was rotten. You can do much more with a villain part.
Movies are full of leading men, most of whom aren't working. It's much harder to find a good villain.
