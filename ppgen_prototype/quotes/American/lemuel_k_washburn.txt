Honesty is never seen sitting astride the fence.
The foolish and cruel notion that a wife is to obey her husband has sent more women to the grave than to the courts for a divorce.
Religion is no more the parent of morality than an incubator is the mother of a chicken.
If God exists, what objection can he have to saying so?
If there were no ministers and no priests, how long would there be any churches?
If we do not need to worship God six days in the week why do we need to worship him on the seventh?
