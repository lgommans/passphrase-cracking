I believe in rules. Sure I do. If there weren't any rules, how could you break them?
I come to win.
Baseball is like church. Many attend few understand.
Nice guys finish last.
God watches over drunks and third baseman.
What are we out at the park for, except to win?
Show me a good loser and I'll show you an idiot.
If you don't win, you're going to be fired. If you do win, you've only put off the day you're going to be fired.
I never did say that you can't be a nice guy and win. I said that if I was playing third base and my mother rounded third with the winning run, I'd trip her up.
Buy a steak for a player on another club after the game, but don't even speak to him on the field. Get out there and beat them to death.
Win any way you can as long as you can get away with it.
As long as I've got a chance to beat you I'm going to take it.
I never questioned the integrity of an umpire. Their eyesight, yes.
You don't save a pitcher for tomorrow. Tomorrow it may rain.
There are only five things you can do in baseball - run, throw, catch, hit and hit with power.
Give me some scratching, diving, hungry ballplayers who come to kill you.
How you play the game is for college ball. When you're playing for money, winning is the only thing that matters.
I made a game effort to argue but two things were against me: the umpires and the rules.
In the olden days, the umpire didn't have to take any courses in mind reading. The pitcher told you he was going to throw at you.
Nobody ever won a pennant without a star shortstop.
Some guys are admired for coming to play, as the saying goes. I prefer those who come to kill.
You argue with the umpire because there is nothing else you can do about it.
Winning is a habit.
You can't get any pictures from way back there.
