American,Actor
I met Roger Ebert at an independent-film awards or something. And he said, 'When I saw you just now, I wanted to punch you in the face. And then I had to remember you're an actor. So, congratulations!' Those are my accolades.
The last thing I wanna do is sit home and watch television.
I've known Larry Clark since I was fourteen. I've always skateboarded in Manhattan. Larry got into the scene in the early '90s, taking pictures and skating with us.
Miramax didn't introduce the actors at any of the screenings. That's why a lot of people thought 'Kids' was a documentary. I still meet people who think it was real.
I had no money. I just figured out hustles to get by, like maybe selling my clothes. I wanted to travel around and be broke and live in sketchy apartments.
Two of my favorite artists are Josh Smith and Joe Bradley. But I argued against them for years, until I grew to love them and felt stupid for my immediate reaction towards their work.
I never went to school for art or was told what to like or when. So every day is a learning process, like most of life.
I'm not an artist or a collector. I'm a skateboard kid with no one to tell me if I'm not doing things the right way.
I just thought it made sense to call a book 'Not Garbage,' even though the majority of it was going to be the scraps from people's studios; like newspaper clippings, weird drawings and stuff they might not necessarily show as artists.
Ray Johnson was a great innovator of mail art and photocopying and sending people photocopies.
I was a very close friend of Dash Snow's, so whenever I get a chance to revisit his work, that's always amazing for me.
