Opportunity knocks only once. You never know if you'll get another opportunity.
I'm happy 'bout life. Still trying. I ain't giving up on life.
I'm gonna keep going.
Kids always need a role model. I let them know you can do it, too, if you really want to.
I know a lot of people think I'm dumb. Well, at least I ain't no educated fool.
God gave me the strength to see, and breathe, and talk.
I didn't push Cory. I wanted him to decide if he wanted to go into boxing and he did. Can't blame it on me.
It ain't what you do it's how you do it.
Well, I'm still breathing.
I have no regrets.
I still am champion in my own right.
You do the best you can.
I got hit a lot. I'm glad I lived through it.
If I can give you some kind of knowledge of life you should listen.
I never did think I had brain damage.
I don't want the kids to go through want I went through.
I love helping the kids.
You can't do nothing but try if you still got it in your heart.
It's still in my heart. I can do it.
