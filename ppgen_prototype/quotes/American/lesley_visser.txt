Guys do not have a genetic blueprint that allows them to understand or love sports.
I don't know if everybody is ready to hear a woman tell them so-and-so is going to run off left tackle. But you know what? They're going to hear it.
My schedule has slowed a little. I've cut back on some of my assignments. But I still have the enthusiasm for the sports world that I had 38 years ago.
I'm proud of my status as a pioneer in this business.
For years, I stored my sweaters in the oven.
Everything is working.
All the cameras shifted from the players to me.
I went to the top of the Cotton Bowl by myself, sat down and cried.
What kept me going through all the years? More than anything, the love of and respect for competition. That's what it comes down to for me. That's why I do this.
That I've lasted is one of my greatest accomplishments. Maybe my greatest.
