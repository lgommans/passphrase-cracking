The monuments of the nations are all protests against nothingness after death; so are statues and inscriptions; so is history.
When people are lonely they stoop to any companionship.
Beauty is altogether in the eye of the beholder.
As a rule, there is no surer way to the dislike of men than to behave well where they have behaved badly.
One is never more on trial than in the moment of excessive good fortune.
