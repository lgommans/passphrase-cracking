A happy life is one spent in learning, earning, and yearning.
You can get through life with bad manners, but it's easier with good manners.
What you get is a living, what you give is a life.
The older I get, the more I believe in what I can't explain or understand, even more than the things that are explainable and understandable.
Never get caught acting.
Young man, if God had wanted you to see me that way, he would have put your eyes in your bellybutton.
The stage was our school, our home, our life.
