In the end it's about the work, not an award you get for the work.
All I'm thinking about today is cleaning my bathroom.
I would love to have children, yes. Maybe even adopt them. I'm not sure that I should pass on my genes.
I'm convinced my mother only had sex eight times.
Sometimes the only thing we women want is a dick and no arguments. What could make us happier?
As actors, the thing we have to fight, more than even the business part of making movies, is boredom.
Chazz Palminteri is just the ultimate screen husband.
He allowed us to choreograph the sex scenes.
I don't look at scripts in terms of commerciality. I just look at the part, the people involved.
I go to bed with men, not boys.
I never wear leather.
I would like to do maybe a smaller romantic comedy.
I've been in the bargain basement of the movie business.
If I'm not afraid when I'm reading a script, that means I know I've done it before. If I read something and think, Wow, I can't play this part, then I want to play it more.
It didn't rain today, so I didn't have to work. Why don't you have to sit around and wait until it rains?
Marriage is a financial contract; I have enough contracts already.
People over 30 are interested in sex too, but they get real movies about it.
Teens aren't just interested in getting laid. I won't believe that's all they're interested in. I have four younger sisters and they're sick of being shown how they're supposed to react in bed.
They're my favorite two words these days: Oscar reject.
You can talk about movies all you want, but I have this porcelain fetish. I've had it since I was a kid, because there were so many kids in my family, the only place I had any solace was in the bathroom.
