I was devastated when 'Days' let me go and couldn't help but feel it was my fault. What did I do wrong? What happened? It sucks. You always think it's your fault.
The confirmation for both jobs - 'AMC' and 'Smallville' - came through on the same day, so there was a lot of wine flowing in the Hartley house that night!
I just want to keep going with the soaps. Maybe it's because I'm just so used to them. I was 21 when I started 'Passions' and did that for nine years. It's what I know.
I started in musicals. My first professional experience was Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' in Palm Springs.
There is an event once a year that I'm able to sing at, through 'Passions,' in Tennessee. That's always fun. We perform at the Wild Horse Saloon.
I've been doing musicals since forever. Actually, I was focused on singing and becoming a singer until I landed on 'Passions.'
When I left 'Days of Our Lives,' I was like, 'I don't know if I'm ever working again. I'm going to do the best I can. If it happens, great. If not, well... it sucks for me.'
If you've got comic book fans and soap fans and country fans, I think you've hit the whole world. What else is there?
When I say, 'We're a team,' the reason why I point that out is because at 'All My Children,' that's the mindset. They're a team. And I've said this to other people: They're like a united front.
