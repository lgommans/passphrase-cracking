I don't take myself too seriously.
If you follow the trend, you'll always be right behind it.
My father played with Air Supply, Yes, B.B. King and even Sheryl Crow when she first started out, so I've sort of been around the industry for a long time.
My mother was a choreographer, so music has always been around.
I'm not really afraid of somebody who's very politically vocal. My mother is very strong, and I really believe in freedom of speech.
I think everybody has their pain. For me, the time that I really had to grow up was when I was 15 and I had my best friend die of leukemia. Watching somebody so strong go through that is definitely something that will give you a little bit of depth. There have been a lot of things that have happened in my life that has forced me to grow up.
I use acting to get away from myself and to live in someone else's skin, and I do singing to get inside my own skin. I need them both for my emotional health.
I was feeling really restless in my hard-rock band. I wanted to learn more about storytelling in music, and that's what country music is.
