American,Model
I dress myself, not to impress, but for comfort and for style.
Real success is not, like, materialistic. It's being where you want to be when you want to be; just living your life how you feel; having an ultimate goal and being able to accomplish it.
I love singing, it lifts my spirit.
Being nervous is a waste of time.
You can't just come from Kansas, go into fashion and be all naive. The fashion world is very different to where I'm from.
I measure the amount of shows I should do by my hair. If my hair isn't good for campaigns and editorials, then obviously I am not going to look good.
If I didn't ever model? I would be back in Kansas. I would probably end up being a pastry chef. My grandma taught me how to make a pie.
If you're a model, you're paid to be a muse.
I love hats! I collect vintage ones - I find them at antique shops in Kansas.
If you're a model, you're supposed to know how to walk, aren't you?
I really like Amelia Earhart. She's from Kansas. She disappeared, so I have to take her place. I want to be Dorothy. I want to be Amelia Earhart... I want to do it all.
