When I talk to young people who want to go to Broadway or whatever, I say, 'The highs are very high and the lows are very low and then there is a lot in between.'
There's just something that is kind of magical that happens when we sing live.
A lot of my albums that I've done, a lot of the songs have been the first take. It's before you mess with it too much - you can take away all the spontaneity and the emotion of something by trying to make it sound perfect.
I love originating shows and originating songs - there is nothing better than being the first one to get to do a song.
