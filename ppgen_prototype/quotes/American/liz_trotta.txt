The military is not a social services operation or a testing ground for gender wars. It is a fighting machine. Women are not as strong as men. Their instincts and reactions in crises are markedly different.
I'm very apolitical. I mean, after having covered politicians so much all my life, I basically have no belief in politics. But it's more of an attitude and a discipline in the way you approach life, I think, than it is just what lever you pull in a voting booth.
I'm intolerant often, especially of incompetence, particularly my own.

Unless you're really interested in sleaze, you should not buy 'Newsweek.'
