American,Cartoonist
All cartoonists are linked together in the world - it's our language, one we can communicate in.
One of the perks of being a 'New Yorker' cartoonist is that you get to hang around with interesting people. My fellow cartoonists are all interesting, and all highly creative.
It was actually an Israeli cartoonist, Nurit Karlin, who made me think that I could draw for 'The New Yorker.' I saw her work published in the magazine in the early 1970s - she was the only woman working as a cartoonist at 'The New Yorker' at the time.
I'm not a politician or a political expert, but I believe that there are many ways to look at peace.
