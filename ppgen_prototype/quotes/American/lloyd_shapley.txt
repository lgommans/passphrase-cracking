American,Economist
I never, never in my life took a course in economics.
I'm a mathematician and always have been, as far as I can remember. I don't remember when I first got involved with mathematics, but I think of myself always as a mathematician first.
Now, I'm ahead of my father. He got other prizes... But he did not get a Nobel Prize.
