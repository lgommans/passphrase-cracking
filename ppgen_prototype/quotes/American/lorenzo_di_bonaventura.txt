The amount of piracy is extraordinary. People don't realize how big it is.
If the studio wants to spend money on making your movie better, let them.
I mean, I'm not a contrarian.
I think when you're doing something cutting edge like 'The Matrix,' it might mean when everybody's saying 'no' that you're really on the right track.
What I can't figure out is why we're not making more R-rated movies, actually.
One of the things that's driving films in a particular direction is that the after market value of them is dropping really fast and in many segments of it, not just DVDs. Pay television is dropping.
My experience is that you can't possibly win against whatever the tidal wave is that's coming at you.
The action pictures I've been typically involved with, when somebody gets punched, you really feel the punching, and when somebody gets shot, you really feel the shot.
What I keep searching for in movies, more and more, is the right gravity.
I don't like the term 'ensemble.' It's bland to me.
As a producer, I try to bring as many nice people as I can to insure that there's no screaming, there's no shouting, there's no bullying. The more of those kind of people that you can bring together, the better the experience everyone has on set.
It's so hard to find a director who, when you look at their body of work, you like everything.
People laugh at me because I don't even know what I'm doing tomorrow.
