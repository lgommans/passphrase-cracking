American,Composer
Three days in a city now and I'm quite flipped. There's too much noise. I just can't do with it.
We get more dangerous as we accumulate knowledge, and that's both a sadness and something to control, try to learn to live with, make terms with.
I don't want to wear my compositional tools on my sleeve.
