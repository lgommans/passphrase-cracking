American,First Lady
I was a Scout years ago, before the movement started, when my father took me fishing, camping and hunting. Then I was sorry that more girls could not have what I had. When I learned of the movement, I thought, here is what I always wanted other girls to have.
The independent girl is truly of quite modern origin, and usually is a most bewitching little piece of humanity.
I majored in geology in college but have majored in Herbert Hoover ever since.
The independent girl is a person before whose wrath only the most rash dare stand, and, they, it must be confessed, with much fear and trembling.
