A rabbi should not despair if people do not do as much as they should. Every parent has that with children. God is merciful.
We realize that Judaism as a faith can survive only in an atmosphere of general faith.
The road to success, and by that I mean... the possibility of giving the best one has to the cause that one loves most, is not easy.
It therefore become essential for the future of Judaism itself that its advancement should be correlated with a similar effort to advance the cause of religion generally.
It is a grave matter to enter a war, without adequate military preparation; it may prove fatal to come into peace, without moral and religious preparation.
In taking action we must remember that the things which are happening to the Jews today are but a part of the general disintegration anticipated by philosophers and historians of different schools for almost half a century.
I hope to devote all of my spare time, which ordinarily would go to research, my summers, and every ounce of strength I can muster to further the project.
I feel very strongly that it is vital for us to constantly keep in mind the fact that the Jewish problem is but a phase of the world problem.
From the long range point of view, I do not know of anything we can do more important than to make some contribution to the preservation of religion as a vital force in America.
For as Jews, the problem happens to be more urgent and vital than for others; because the destruction of religion on America will involve the destruction also of the religious training of freedom; and with that our civil liberties.
