American,Artist
I didn't really come from money. So I wanted my thesis show to grab as much attention as possible.
I definitely am concerned with preservation. For me, what's interesting is the archival state, or how long oil paintings last.
I started thinking about how rain is depicted in illustrations. In comics that use gouache or watercolor, they use light blue, so I started using that color.
People understand what art is supposed to look like, and so it's easy to make something that looks like art but isn't - especially in an abstract form.
I was born in L.A., but raised in New York.
