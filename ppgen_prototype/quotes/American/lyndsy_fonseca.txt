Pilates is my favorite meditative way to get in shape. I don't like the gym and I don't like running, so I just lay on my Pilates reformer. It's great.
Comic-Con is overwhelming when you have such a long day of press schedules.
Literally since I could walk... I was performing.
I'm very bubbly, so when people meet me, they sometimes think I'm fake. I'm excited to meet new people, but I guess I sound like I'm being sarcastic.
Women tend to take care of men a lot, but I like a guy who balances that out and takes care of me, too.
Guys need to know when to take charge.
The best relationships are when you both want to make each other happy - you buy the groceries, I do the dishes.
When a man leaves you notes saying he loves you, or asks how your day was - and then listens - you feel special.
I wanted to be a dancer my whole life. And when I gave it up to act, I always had a really sad part of myself that missed it and missed performing and missed being physical in that way.
It's really hard to meet good women in Hollywood.
I think it's very rare that you see girl friendships on television. It's always cattiness and all that drama.
I love 'Breaking Bad.' I think that's my favorite show.
When I was a dancer, I felt this great sense of knowing my body and being in my body, and I think it's really easy as women to lose that and not really be one and loving it.
