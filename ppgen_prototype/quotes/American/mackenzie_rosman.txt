American,Actress
I like having a smaller family. I think the more people you have in the family, the more people there are to have problems with.
It's really important to find something you really enjoy - something you can focus on and be good at.
I like 'Star Wars.' I mean, I don't go to the conventions and dress up like Obi-Wan Kenobi or anything, but I like watching the movies.
I don't deal with the whole 'bad boy who doesn't call you.' That doesn't interest me at all, and I just look the other way.
I used to have a really big crush on Hayden Christensen.
I've never been strong with my time-management skills.
I'm not really the one in my family who knows everything that's going on, because I don't really pay attention.
I don't know what I want to be when I grow up. It's funny - people ask me that, and I don't know what to tell them.
