American,Actress
Im not your biggest girly girl.
As a theater actor I always wondered, 'Is there a place for me in Hollywood?'
Cate Blanchett is somebody who I could watch do anything. I love what an extraordinary chameleon she can be. There's something about the way she bends and transforms that feels otherworldly to me.
A day on a film set is maddening.
I was an English major in college!
I so never went through a bad-girl period.
I grew up in the Bronx, but in Riverdale - not exactly an area of New York that's known for being rough and tumble.
