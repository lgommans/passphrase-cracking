American,Actress
It is possible that blondes also prefer gentlemen.
I came to Hollywood determined to follow in Jean Harlow's footsteps, but I was determined not to die young. My hope was to endure. And endure I have.
I have never been a Marilyn Monroe wannabe. I have always been happy in my own skin!
I didn't feel like I was meant to be a nurse or a secretary.
Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and I were so different from each other. I was doing very young movies, and Marilyn, who was ahead of me, was doing a lot of homogenized movies that weren't quite as wild as the ones I was doing. Jayne was more of a character of herself.
I took my acting very seriously. I did over 40 films, and naturally, some of them were called B-movies because the woman was at the top of the billing. Women couldn't star in their own movies.
I never wanted to be a trophy wife. I wanted to make it on my own. I didn't want to depend on a man.
I studied really hard. But Hollywood never appreciated my talent.
My best asset is my brain. Without my brain, I don't think the rest of me would be too hot.
