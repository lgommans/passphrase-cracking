American,Photographer
I photograph the things that I do not wish to paint, the things which already have an existence.
It has never been my object to record my dreams, just the determination to realize them.
Of course, there will always be those who look only at technique, who ask 'how', while others of a more curious nature will ask 'why'. Personally, I have always preferred inspiration to information.
I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive.
One of the satisfactions of a genius is his will-power and obstinacy.
An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an originals motivated be necessity. It is marvelous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms. To create is divine, to reproduce is human.
A creator needs only one enthusiast to justify him.
Don't put my name on it. These are simply documents I make.
To me, a painter, if not the most useful, is the least harmful member of our society.
All critics should be assassinated.
