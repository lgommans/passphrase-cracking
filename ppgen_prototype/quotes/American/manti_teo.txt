As long as my family's OK, I'll be fine.
The NFL is my goal, not my dream. My dream is to have an impact on people.
Ever since I was young, if somebody needs help, you help them out.
Things happen. And good things happen, and bad things happen. And I'm a person - I'm a believer that everything happens for a reason.
I think I've learned the difference between the things I can control and the things I can't control. And hopefully, by doing the things I can control well, I'll have more favor in the other category.
I think what I bring to the table is a lot of heart, a lot of energy, and somebody that works hard. Somebody who hates to lose.
The reason why I love to win is because I don't have to go through that feeling of losing. It's those times where I lose that feeling that will stick with me.
Ray Lewis, I've grown up watching Ray Lewis. Just watching his intensity, his passion for the game, his love for the game, his work ethic. Everything in a linebacker that you want to be is in Ray Lewis, from leadership qualities, all that.
For me, the greatest fault would be to tell somebody something I'm not.
