When you don't inherit an identity you have to define it on your own.
I just like that dynamic in relationships in movies where they're kind of lovers as rivals, you know?
It's such a thrilling part about being in a relationship at a young age, and all your feelings are apocalyptic, all your emotions are so huge.
I was a Marvel guy. I started reading comics when I was a kid.

One of my life philosophies is that you have a choice to make when you're doing something creative. You can be cheesy... or you can be lame.
Everybody's part of the greater whole and skepticism and virtue are a part of that.
I always remembered that when I saw people get married they got on a rocketship and went to Planet Happiness, Population: Them.

'Batman' was scary.
