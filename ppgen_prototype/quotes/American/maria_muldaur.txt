I've been told that 'Midnight at the Oasis' has been responsible for the conception of more children than any other song of the '70s.
I'm not one of those spoiled rock stars who complains about how tedious it is to perform my old hits.
I am always most excited about the newest material I am doing, and other songs get put back on the shelf or dropped.
