I love people who are inches away from completely falling apart. I think that's a fun, electric character to take on.
I think the trick to playing villains is that you can't play them as if they know that they're villains, otherwise it becomes some sort of mustache-twirling caricature!
There's nothing more fun than putting on an old costume and jewelry and being in a house that's decorated from the '20s or '30s or whatever.
It's not like I'm that wildly famous that it's disrupted my lifestyle in some way.
I'd love to do more TV, but I'd love to get into more feature films. I'd also love to go back to the stage when the time and opportunity is right. I haven't gotten to do a lot of that here in L.A., but my favorite thing to do is live theatre. I'd love to actually have a career where you can kind of move in and out of all of those mediums.
