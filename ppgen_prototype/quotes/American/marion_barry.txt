The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. The law of gravity is racist.
I am making this trip to Africa because Washington is an international city, just like Tokyo, Nigeria or Israel. As mayor, I am an international symbol. Can you deny that to Africa?
I read a funny story about how the Republicans freed the slaves. The Republicans are the ones who created slavery by law in the 1600's. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was not a Republican.
I have to admit I didn't do as much as I should have back when I was mayor, but now we're getting it done. It's not where you've been but where you're going.
Outside of the killings, Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.
First, it was not a strip bar, it was an erotic club. And second, what can I say? I'm a night owl.
The brave men who died in Vietnam, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice.
Aside from the murders, DC has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.
I promise you a police car on every sidewalk.
If you take out the killings, Washington actually has a very very low crime rate.
I am clearly more popular than Reagan. I am in my third term. Where's Reagan? Gone after two! Defeated by George Bush and Michael Dukakis no less.
People have criticised me because my security detail is larger than the president's. But you must ask yourself: are there more people who want to kill me than who want to kill the president? I can assure you there are.
People blame me because these water mains break, but I ask you, if the water mains didn't break, would it be my responsibility to fix them then?
This is not a sham, not a game. This is the real stuff.
What right does Congress have to go around making laws just because they deem it necessary?
I like boxing.
When you know more, you can do more.
My greatest work comes in the community.
