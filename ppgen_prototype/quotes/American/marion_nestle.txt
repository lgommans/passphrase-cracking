I follow my own advice: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and grains, and don't eat too much junk food. It leaves plenty of flexibility for eating an occasional junk food.
How we grow food has enormous effects on the environment - climate change as well as pollution of air, water, and soil.
It's time to get the FDA to reverse its 1994 decision not to label GM foods.
The best way to eat is to eat lots of different kinds of foods. Except for breast milk, no one food is perfect.
I have a generally optimistic temperament and am thrilled by what I see as a rapidly growing food movement, especially among young people who care about how food is produced and what it does to their health and the environment.
I am not a vegetarian. I subscribe to my own mantra: eat less, move more, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, don't eat too much junk food, and enjoy what you eat. Or, to summarise: eat less, eat better, move more, and get political.
Healthy, sustainable food production methods give us food that is nutritionally better and with fewer pesticides, antibiotics, and hormones.
I don't define anything I eat as a vice.
