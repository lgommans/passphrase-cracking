I think there are very few people who have a real style, a real personality, and real beauty.
A lot of men are very possessive and they want to control you. But as you grow older, you attract people who are on your wavelength and who understand who you are.
I'm a free spirit, so if I am with someone it has to be a man who understands that, and not all men do.
I wanted to become a model since I was a kid.
I'm not someone who lives in the past; I find other people live in my past. I live in the present and the future.
I adored my father - I was more attached to him than anyone.
I do think I learned to accept myself through the eyes of others when I was young because I wasn't brought up to think that I was beautiful or told I was beautiful.
I think I was very shy and introverted when I was younger, and yet, when I got in front of the camera or went out on the town, I was able to go out half-naked and do anything.
As I get older, I feel better about myself because I've done a lot of spiritual work on myself and balanced myself out, and so I feel more confident about myself as a person and as a woman.
I wasn't happy at all as a child. I was very privileged and knew extraordinary people, but I felt very lonely: my mother thought I was extremely difficult and my grandmother was extremely severe.
When I get in front of a camera all my fears and my inhibitions just go away. As a model, I feel that I am acting, too, playing different parts and showing different facets of myself.
My ultimate goal is to become a saint.
