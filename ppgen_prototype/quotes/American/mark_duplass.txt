I'm interested to see what happens to Spike Lee with limited resources, you know? I love Spike Lee's movies. But you know what? I kinda liked his movies when he used to scramble and fight more for them.
When you're improvising, it's fun to find something that you can lean on that is similar to your life experience. In my opinion, that's very helpful.
'Somewhere in Time' is in the top-five cheesiest movies ever made. It's super melodrama.
They're each on separate coasts but I think that the deep Maine woods shares some similarities to the Pacific Northwest.
If you're locked to the words on the script, as good as those scripted words are, if you didn't have the time to rehearse them correctly or if the perceived dynamic between the actors is different from what the writer imagined, and you're not allowed to stray from that, you're going to have a stilted scene.
I question every move. I'm constantly second-guessing myself.
You know, I watched the original 'Same Time, Next Year' on DVD about ten times this year, and I cried all ten times.
Obviously we know Bill Hader is funny and charming, but my question is, can he do raw humanity and naturalism? I think so.
