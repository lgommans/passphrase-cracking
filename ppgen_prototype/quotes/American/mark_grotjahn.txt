American,Artist
I've got two girls, and they both make beautiful drawings. One of them really has a gift for the way that she colors around certain lines.
I got my first show at Blum & Poe because Paul McCarthy postponed his show, and they came to my studio and asked me if I could put together a show in two weeks.
I think my masks reference artists who reference primitivism. They're not directly connected to tribal arts. I think they look more like third-grade art projects.
