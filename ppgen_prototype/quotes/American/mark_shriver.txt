Children without access to quality early education programs start kindergarten with an 18-month disadvantage, and that gap continues to widen. By the time they are in fourth grade, many cannot do math or read at grade level.
Every family struggles with different things, and everybody struggles with different things.
I never met my Uncle Jack. My mom was six months pregnant with me when he died. But I knew his wife and two kids very well.
I miss both of my parents terribly every day, but especially as we approach Thanksgiving. We always came together as a family for that holiday, playing capture the flag and touch football and laughing a lot.
I had the fixation that comes with being a Kennedy to be a great man on the big stage.
Dad was joyful until the day he died, and I think that joy was deeply rooted in his love affair with God.
I had had a father whose shoes I could never fill, against whom I would never measure up; yet, I felt no pressure do so.
