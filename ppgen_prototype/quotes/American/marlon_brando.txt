American,Actor
Never confuse the size of your paycheck with the size of your talent.
To grasp the full significance of life is the actor's duty, to interpret it is his problem, and to express it his dedication.
The only reason I'm in Hollywood is that I don't have the moral courage to refuse the money.
I have eyes like those of a dead pig.
An actor is at most a poet and at least an entertainer.
With women, I've got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end. I slip the loop around their necks so they can't get away or come too close. Like catching snakes.
If you want something from an audience, you give blood to their fantasies. It's the ultimate hustle.
The only thing an actor owes his public is not to bore them.
If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner.
Acting is the expression of a neurotic impulse. It's a bum's life. Quitting acting, that's the sign of maturity.
There's a line in the picture where he snarls, 'Nobody tells me what to do.' That's exactly how I've felt all my life.
I don't mind that I'm fat. You still get the same money.
An actor's a guy who, if you ain't talking about him, ain't listening.
Privacy is not something that I'm merely entitled to, it's an absolute prerequisite.
If there's anything unsettling to the stomach, it's watching actors on television talk about their personal lives.
