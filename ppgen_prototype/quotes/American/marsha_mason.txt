The complexity of the emotional life of the play is what you live to work on.
I always hated the part when I had to look pretty. I love that I don't have to look pretty.
It's enormously good fun. I love it. I really do. I have this sort of set face.
I thought I wasn't attractive or talented anymore. I cried easily and was depressed and removed. I became emotionally insecure about what the second half of my life would bring. I was angry, scared, frightened and lonely.
The idea of being a single woman in Hollywood is a very peculiar thing.
