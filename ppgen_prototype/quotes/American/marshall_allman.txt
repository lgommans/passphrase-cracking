American,Actor
To act, no matter how the character is, you have to love and have compassion for the character you're playing.
You can't judge a character that you're playing, because then you're fighting against doing what the character's doing.
To me, 'Blue Like Jazz' is a quintessential American story. So many people are just like Don - raised Christian and go off to college only to abandon their beliefs in order to fit in or be accepted.
For me, the more talented the actor is that I'm working with, the easier my job is because the circumstances of a scene are easier to believe when the people around you are in the moment just as much as you are.
To me, the most interesting part of 'True Blood' is that the entire crux of the show is based on identity and finding your true identity.
