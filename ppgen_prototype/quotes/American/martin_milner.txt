Actors really should be tramps.
It seems the farther away we are from Hollywood, the better the ratings.
My main worry is that after a certain point you become so identified with a character and a series that you might not be able to get work when your show goes off the air.
Having covered some half a hundred cities, towns, villages, and wide spots in the road during the last tow years, George and I fairly wallowed in the comfort of our own home base.
My wife and two children traveled with me on locations all last season.
Every weekend he'd have me come down to work on Dragnet, which by now was on television as well as radio.
We also have 2 horses, but they're not allowed in the house.
Three days a week and I'm home at the ranch in Fallbrook with my avocados.
On other shows, guys can't wait to put 3000 miles between them during hiatus.
I have no complaints on any level. I'm pretty happy about the way everything has turned out.
I did radio back in the era when we did radio drama.
I even played Jack Webb's partner on the radio version of Dragnet for a while.
We host some trips all over the world. We go to Alaska. We go to Mexico. We're going to Venezuela in December. We've been to Russia, all in conjunction with the radio show.
There is no overt rivalry among our children.
I was never a celebrity - just a working actor.
I love talk and I love fishing. I'm having a ball.
