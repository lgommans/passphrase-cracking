I love to work with people and do what I love.
I love working with my friends.
I'm not one of those guys that's a purist when it comes to videogames.
Every day's a blessing, right? It's all in your control.
I feel like there are things I can relate to in every character. But I feel like when you read a script, you don't get to see the definition behind someone, you just get to read what the person goes through and find a place to come from to make it real.
