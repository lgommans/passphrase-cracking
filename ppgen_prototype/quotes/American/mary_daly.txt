I saw women that were repressed. When they're in classes with young men, they shut up all the time. They're laughed at if they have unusual ideas. They have to be sexy; then, they can't really think.
Almost everything has been stolen from us by the patriarchy. Our creativity has been stolen, our creative energies, our religion. I want it back.
'God's plan' is often a front for men's plans and a cover for inadequacy, ignorance, and evil.
The message is risk, really risk. Be yourself. Create.
I'm a complete deviant. All creative work breaks new ground.
For a radical feminist to try to change the church was like a black person trying to reform the Ku Klux Klan.
I didn't study theology out of piety. I studied it because I wanted to know.
Why indeed must 'God' be a noun? Why not a verb - the most active and dynamic of all.
It is the creative potential itself in human beings that is the image of God.
Women have had the power of naming stolen from us.
Work is a substitute religious experience for many workaholics.
Courage to be is the key to revelatory power of the feminist revolution.
I hate the Bible. I always did.
The Adequate Protest demands far more than protests. It calls for Great and Daring Leaps of Integrity and Courage to See.
I have a theory of living on the boundary: on the boundary of patriarchy and the boundary of different dimensions.
I'm trying to get to a deep future, but in order to get to a deep future, I had to think about the deep past.
I don't want to be a fulfilled woman.
Think of Virginia Woolf, 'A Room of One's Own' - that's what women have always needed under patriarchy and can't be creative without. They took away my classroom and my status to teach, and now they have taken away my office, and all of it is giving the message that Virginia Woolf and I are losing what I call 'womenspace.'
I was honestly a Catholic.
Radical feminism is still threatening.
