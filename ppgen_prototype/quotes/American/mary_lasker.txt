American,Activist
I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes the way I am opposed to sin.
Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes. I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people.
Without money nothing gets done.
In Democratic administrations, I visit the White House.
