One of the things I love about shooting the most is that there's no specific body type or body build that someone has to have.
There is nothing wrong with my mind.
A big endorsement deal would be awesome.
Failure and things of this sort - you can take it one of two ways. You can either let that hurt you and really affect the way that you live your life in the future, or you can use that as an opportunity for growth.
It's sometimes the random people that say things that aren't so nice, but that's okay.
In my sport, we're measured in millimeters and fractions of millimeters.
You know, life is long. My shooting career is long.
I grew up with people staring at me because I was such a tall, awkward girl.
I had the '80s hair and braces and a 6-3 frame as a 16-year-old.
Basketball made me happy to be tall. And more secure about myself than I ever would have been without it.
