I always see people tweeting about these crazy amazing things their boyfriend or girlfriend did for them. You shouldn't have to constantly be trying to prove your love when you're in a relationship.
My mom always liked the idea of us acting - me and my sister - like, one of us trying it. But my dad always thought it was a joke.
My first real kiss was in seventh grade. It was at the movie 'Hardball,' starring Keanu Reeves, and it was with my little sixth grade girlfriend. It was the first time we were alone. Her mom was sitting two rows in front of us!
When you're young and dating someone, just play it safe and don't try so hard.
