I've done all of them except for Oprah. My shoes were on Oprah but they ran out of time so I wasn't on. I left my shoes in Chicago so they could put them on the show.
I just like to take it as it comes, go where the wind blows me. I'm not going to plan.
Yes, for my undergrad I majored in Criminal Justice and minored in Political Science and English.
Yeah, what happened was Universal wanted one of the characters to be nice so they chose me so there was a scene where the girl was tied to the bed and I let her go.
Yeah, I did a cameo in an upcoming movie called Constantine.
Well, I see myself in the same business but a lot more successful and doing more movies maybe behind the camera. I plan to do some growing in this industry and take it as far as I can.
There are a lot of things you can do with a law degree background, but I just didn't have a passion for it.
The Dead was cool, It's a great horror story. I went to the casting director of this movie and talked to him, then they called my agent and had me come in and read for it and they wanted to use me.
Short films don't go too far.
It was weird because I'd only been in L.A. for about six months and I had my first feature.
I'd love to work on a script in collaboration.
I would love to do a comedy spoof, like a Spinal Tap kind of thing.
I thought I wanted to be a lawyer and was going through this growth phase.
I think for something like law or medicine you really have to love it and I didn't love it.
Hmm mmm I mean, work is work, I'll take whatever work I can get.
Basically, right before college I got into the Guinness book for my feet and started to do local commercials and little radio spots, just little things and found I really liked it.
Actually, that's one of the things I was thinking about writing a story about me, loosely based or autobiographical. I just don't want to be like some people that are in their twenties and writing autobiographies.
