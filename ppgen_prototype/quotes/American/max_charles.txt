American,Actor
I like to do a lot of different things in acting.
I would like to be in tons of different types of movies and do different things. I like action movies, and with 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman', I got to see a historical movie, too.
I love math.
I like being outside and seeing a lot of new things.
I have an awesome team. We all talk about what projects are the best for me to work on for my career and which ones to pass on.
My favorite super hero has always been Spiderman.
I like the superhero comic books, and I like to see what the actors do creatively with the characters and how they bring these superheroes to life in the movies.
When I finish my school work for the day, I like to go play basketball, ride my bike or skateboard, play video games, or go free running.
