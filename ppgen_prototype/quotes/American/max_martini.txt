I want people to take the initiative to find veterans that need help, veterans that are suffering and in need of assistance reintegrating from combat back into society, into normal family lives and jobs. We need to take a real 'boots on the ground' approach to helping veterans in need.
When passerby's ignore homeless people, they don't know if that was a man or woman in uniform previously. They should not be invisible. They cannot be ignored.
When suffering from TBI and PTSD, it's difficult to find the motivation to seek help. I want society not to forget those that served this country.
I want people to get involved and to connect with veterans.
While shooting 'The Unit', I went to the Middle East twice to see the troops. I met some great men and women.
When I started as an actor, I kind of started with a couple features. I've been waiting for the opening.
Television was a great place for me to kind of fall on my face and make mistakes and be okay with it and move on.
