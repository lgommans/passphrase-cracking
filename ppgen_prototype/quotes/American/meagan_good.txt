The beauty of having short hair is that I actually can wash and style it at home!
I love anything vintage. And I love Marc Jacobs and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti.
I love creme liner because I have lash extensions and sometimes the liquid liner can get into the lashes. It's also easier to guide. I can create straighter lines with it.
Make sure your desire to do what you're aspiring to do is deeper than just fame and being a celebrity.
When I was growing up, I lived in a neighborhood that was largely Latino and I thought I was Latino!
I use bath gloves in the shower every day. People often comment on my skin and I just tell them that I use bath gloves.
