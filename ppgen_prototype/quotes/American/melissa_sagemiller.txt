American,Actress
I'm very ticklish. They say being tickled is a form of torture.
I like drama. My first movie that I did, 'Soul Survivors', was a drama, and I'm just drawn to that; that's sort of my forte.
I don't have any control of how I am received. People will either like me, not like me or love to not like me.
