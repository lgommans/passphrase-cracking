American,Actress
I used to joke that if acting didn't work out, poetry was my commonsense fallback.
I usually spend my free time worrying about when I'm going to work next.
I do think there are trends in your life once you've been auditioning long enough. I was the angry teenager and then the sweet victim.
I wrote a lot when I was younger, though never anything like plays or scripts.
Unfortunately, I don't think I can call myself an activist because I don't really do enough of anything.
I went to really good New York City public schools that had arts programs. So in junior high, I got into the drama department. From there, I went to a performing arts high school in New York City called Laguardia and I just kind of fell into the professional side by happenstance.
Theater has always been terrifying to me.
I wish feminism wasn't so scary to people. It should be an evolving concept. I think it's an umbrella term to embrace conflicting ideas.
Broadway is like a club I haven't been invited to, and I'm hoping that maybe they will give me a guest pass one of these days.
I think when you're on a show that takes place in N.Y.C. but film it in L.A. there is just a vibe that feels wrong.
