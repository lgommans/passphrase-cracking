I was always 'foot-in-mouth-Mia.'
To keep your skin looking healthy and young, wear a hat.
Rick Owens is my desert island designer. I could live in his clothes alone, and I collect Ossie Clark.
I'm always in favor of more glamour. I embarrass my children, I think. I am the lady in feathers in the car pool line.

My style was nostalgic and involved pearls and penny loafers, always with the pennies in them.
Most of the time, people think they went to high school with me.
