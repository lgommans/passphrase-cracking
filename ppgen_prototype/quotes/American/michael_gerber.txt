My experience has shown me that the people who are exceptionally good in business aren't so because of what they know but because of their insatiable need to know more.
Most entrepreneurs are merely technicians with an entrepreneurial seizure. Most entrepreneurs fail because you are working IN your business rather than ON your business.
The greatest business people I've met are determined to get it right no matter what the cost.
