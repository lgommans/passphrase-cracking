American,Politician
I'm aggressive, quite frankly, because Staten Island gets screwed all the time. And if I'm not aggressive, then I won't be successful. That's not being a bad boy. That's doing my job.
America stands for the land of opportunity.
The ability to be successful should be a good thing.
I would want to teach my children someday that they should strive to be successful.
What I'm guilty of is trying the hardest and giving 100 percent of myself and putting my heart and soul into representing the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn.
One of the things that I try to do when I have a tough time with anything - whatever it may be - is just look at someone else's situation. Here in Staten Island, look, I have people that have children that haven't been back in their home for 18 months after Sandy. They lost every worldly possession.
I have people coming to me every day, coming to my office, with life-threatening diseases - life-threatening diseases - and they were dropped from their health care because of the Affordable Care Act.
There's no question that, um, you know, the oceans have risen, right? And the climate change part is, is a real part of it.
I have been one of the guys who have been skeptical of global warming from the beginning. The jury is obviously still out on it. We see nothing but conflicting reports from across the globe. I'm not sure; I'm not a scientist.
I don't think it's good for economy to have a broken immigration system.
I am the only Republican Congressman who represents a borough within New York City, a city of 8.5 million people.
