American,Writer
People who are much too sensitive to demand of cripples that they run races ask of the poor that they get up and act just like everyone else in the society.
If there is technological advance without social advance, there is, almost automatically, an increase in human misery.
That the poor are invisible is one of the most important things about them. They are not simply neglected and forgotten as in the old rhetoric of reform; what is much worse, they are not seen.
It takes a certain level of aspiration before one can take advantage of opportunities that are clearly offered.
Clothes make the poor invisible. America has the best-dressed poverty the world has ever known.
Life is lived in common, but not in community.
