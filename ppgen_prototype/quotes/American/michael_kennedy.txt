Israel is one of the easiest places to play ball. When I say easy I am referring to the easy lifestyle an athlete has while in Israel. It's very easy to get around the country, because it's so small.
No one country has a team that hold a monopoly on the league like Maccabi does in Israel.
It's always been an ebb and flow of interest and energy.
I learn something every time I go into the mountains.
Skiing is the pleasurable part of alpinism - way more pleasurable and fun than alpine climbing.
It's about the pleasure of being in the mountains, traveling efficiently over the terrain, having that sense of dynamic motion which you don't get when you're on foot.
