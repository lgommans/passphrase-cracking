It's kind of hard to believe that 'Sherry,' 'Walk Like a Man,' 'Big Girls Don't Cry' - the big three - belong to the same group that does 'Oh, What a Night' and 'Who Loves You.'
I grew up in a town of 5,000, surrounded by cows and oil fields, but there was a lot of opportunity in my tiny little town.
Architecture was always the plan. I always figured I'd just do theater on the side.
Take the leap. If you love theater more than anything, take the leap. It's so rich if you give over fully to it; there are no halfers or returnsies in this business - if you don't... There's no way to go other than full tilt with your life and job.
