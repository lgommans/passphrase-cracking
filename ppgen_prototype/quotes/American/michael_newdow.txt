American,Lawyer
And as soon as I did the research, I realized the law seemed to be on my side and I filed the suit.
But in America, if you're an atheist, you lose.
Government needs to stay out of the religion business altogether.
I believe I am strengthening the Constitution with my case.
I brought this case because I am an atheist and this offends me, and I have the right to bring up my daughter without God being imposed into her life by her schoolteachers.
I choose to worship not believing in God and government should not thrust a religious idea down my throat.
I have numerous people who have expressed a willingness to be plaintiffs.
I was considering running for political office.
It's one of the nice things about this nation that when the Constitution is violated, if it affects you, you can bring a suit.
Most people I know I think agree and even many theists agree with this. We don't want government involved.
My daughter is in the lawsuit because you need that for standing.
Obviously, I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution.
The Constitution says that government isn't supposed to be infusing religion into our society, and so I asked to have that upheld.
This issue is whether or not our government should be infusing religion into (schools).
A federal judge did as he was supposed to do and upheld the Constitution. We should be thankful that we have judiciary that will do that.
I believe in the Constitution. The Constitution says that government isn't supposed to be infusing religion into our society, and so I asked to have that upheld.
No person who denies the existence of a supreme being shall hold any office under this Constitution.
Those who deny the existence of a supreme being have been turned into second-class citizens by a government that continuously sends messages that 'real Americans' believe in God.
