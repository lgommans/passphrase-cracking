I do like to write but I also like to get and out and play. I am losing track of all the Cooper versions that I do - I have one for Iceland, different one over here.
Towards the end it got really rough. I take my hat of to Alice, he's still doing it. This is probably more work than going on the road for 2-3 months. I wish I was 25 again!
It's a gamble. A band like Kiss, a lot of those are our audience but we don't do as much make-up. Alice would have more to lose if we got back together.
I've got them in the can and I am looking for a label.
It started twelve and went on until twelve. I never had to buy a drink all day!
