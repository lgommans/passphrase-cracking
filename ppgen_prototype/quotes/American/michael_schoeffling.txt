Actors spend most of their time out of work, so I actually spend more time making furniture. The thing about furniture that's much better than acting is that it's just me. There's no director, no script - the concept is me, unless a client wants something.
In film work, you do the best you can under the given circumstances, but you don't have control. At least, I don't.
