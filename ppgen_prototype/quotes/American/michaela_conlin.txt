I sample a little bit of everything - a bit of 'House,' a little bit of 'Prison Break.' I love 'Project Runway;' it's my favorite show!
Pilot season in L.A. is just this blood bath. They make so many pilots, and such a small percentage are picked up. And then if you are picked up, there are so many variables. You have to get a good time slot, and you have to get promoted. And then you have to thrive in that time slot.
I never used to get homesick when I first moved to L.A.
Hart Hanson is one of the coolest, smartest producers I've ever worked for. He's very open to ideas, he says no when he should, he says yes when it would work for the show.
I was trained on stage at NYU in New York City; I did a lot of theatre then.
I love 'Project Runway.' It's my favorite show!
