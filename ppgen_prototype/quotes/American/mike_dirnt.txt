I have a daughter and she's the greatest thing that ever happened to me. She gives me a good excuse to watch cartoons.
I think that's the most important thing you can do to be a real person - is to be honest with yourself.
When I listen to songs, I can smell a rat. I like songs that speak to me with some deeper truth.
Listen to the silence. Listen to your life. Be present, not just think about what's going on next week, next month.
I'm an optimistic agnostic. I think the second we die, within a matter of seconds, everybody else arrives, and that's the party, and you live your hell on earth.
I'm an optimist, so I believe in some sort of life after death; I don't know what kind.
