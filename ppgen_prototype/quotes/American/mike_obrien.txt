American,Actor
I share an office with Jason Sudeikis, and I'm friends with him, so I end up writing for him a lot.
The most clear way to decide the actor is to watch them doing stuff during their downtime. When they do something that's making both of you laugh, you see if there's a character or situation that could be written into.
I enjoy, in the summer, getting back to writing in my own voice.
I really loved Andy Kaufman growing up, like every comedy person does. I like when sometimes the audience isn't quite sure what's supposed to be happening right then and that sort of unsafe feeling, as long as you're not punishing them.
