We've gotten through a lot of tough times, and we're going to keep working to make them better. I wish the record was better.
How can you wonder what's going to happen when you don't know who's going to be the new guy in town?
No matter what the situation, winning takes care of a lot of stuff. Things are never perfect, even when you win. But it does make for a lot better environment, for sure.
I'm really going to miss all the people in the front office, media relations, marketing, all the great people at the ball park. They were my family for a while, and that part really stings. But life does go on.
They say baseball is a slow game. It sure doesn't seem that way when you're in the dugout. You think you have it figured out, but things come up quick.
At the minor-league and major-league level, you know how important your coaching staff is, but in a big market it becomes absolutely huge.
You go through all the emotions when you're told to move on.
Everyone knows the game is about the players.
You make decisions and you're not going to please everybody all the time.
It's the age-old thing - it's such a cliche - but why worry about things you have no control over?
I always get a kick out of who is going to be the larger cheering section.
I think the one thing about me is I'm a fairly demanding guy, and I give a great deal of myself, and I expect that in return.
We're going to play better, and we're going to play harder.
We've got to give a quality effort every day and play better.
You look around baseball and when things go south, that type of fan apathy happens.
I watch every day when we hit and take ground balls and the way we go about our business. If I saw any lackadaisical approach, that would concern me.
