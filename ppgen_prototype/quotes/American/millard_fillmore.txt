American,President
God knows I detest slavery but it is an existing evil, and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution.
May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.
It is not strange... to mistake change for progress.
Upon you, fellow-citizens, as the representatives of the States and the people, is wisely devolved the legislative power.
Nations, like individuals in a state of nature, are equal and independent, possessing certain rights and owing certain duties to each other.
