American,Photographer
Be still with yourself until the object of your attention affirms your presence.
No matter how slow the film, Spirit always stands still long enough for the photographer It has chosen.
Often while traveling with a camera we arrive just as the sun slips over the horizon of a moment, too late to expose film, only time enough to expose our hearts.
A very receptive state of mind... not unlike a sheet of film itself - seemingly inert, yet so sensitive that a fraction of a second's exposure conceives a life in it.
I'm always mentally photographing everything as practice.
