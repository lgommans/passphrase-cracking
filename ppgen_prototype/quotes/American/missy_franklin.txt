A huge part of swimming for me is I love it, and it is so much fun.
I'm just an all-around happy girl who loves everything about her life.
For me, it seems to help me take the pressure off if I don't pay attention to what other people are telling me.
Hopefully I don't annoy people too much.
For right now, I still believe that college is what's going to make me the happiest girl.
I don't like watching myself on TV, I don't like reading about myself.
Sometimes when my mom finds a fun article and really wants me to read it, I will. But I prefer to just kind of focus on what I want to do and not really what other people are saying, because I don't want that to affect me too much.
I don't think about the trials and the Olympics a lot. If I do, it's just going to stress me out and get me worried.
I'm always so excited about what I do that I try to get everyone to feel that way.
