American,Actress
As an African American actress, there are people who have been staples in my life that opened a door that I can walk through. I hope that I can have that impact.
'High School Musical' is definitely the best thing that's happened to my career and I walked away with great friends from it.
I have a gajillion headbands - yellows, pinks, reds, blues. I'm obsessed.
I was babysitting the night High School Musical premiered last year. I watched with the kids and we sang along to the lyrics. I was making $12 an hour.
I'm good in the kitchen. I can cook seafood, collard greens, black-eyed peas.
My character, Taylor McKessie, is a little bit brighter in the math and science department than I am... okay, a lot.
When I get recognized, every time feels like the first time.
I look like a child - and I love it!
I've been in the shallow end of a pool, just kind of walking around, but this was my first time really swimming - and I was horrified! I actually lost it whenever I saw the edge of the pool. But I took baby steps and rewarded myself every step of the way.
I play so young because of my looks.
In case of emergency, do whatever your best friends tell you to do!
I love the idea that somebody is going to compare me to my character or think that I am like my character when they see me. I feel like that is a role that I am willing to fulfill.
I think it is important for girls to see movies where it is not all just about 'the boy' or it's simply being about 'the relationship' or 'Am I pretty enough?' or 'Am I cute enough?'.
You have to split, bend over backward, touch our toe to our heads to get recognized.
