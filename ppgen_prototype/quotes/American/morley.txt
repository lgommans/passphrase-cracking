The word 'hope' for me is always infused with action.
What really shifted my understanding of my potential placement in the world of art is when I had a chance to choreograph a show for... It was just this incredible production with all these masters.
My big inspiration for hope is the courage that I read about from people from all over the world, or that I see on a daily basis from the kids I get to work with.
Hope is like compassion to me. It's like possibility and living in possibility.
So many people define themselves by what they've accomplished or not accomplished.
I include myself in the posters because I feel like it forms a more intimate relationship between the artist and the person passing by. And it's important to include some vulnerability and use fears and rejections and various aspects from my own life so people look at my work as more than greeting card fodder.
As a screenwriter, there's so many layers you have to go through in order to tell your story. You have to write the script, get money for the script, shoot it, find distributors, make it into film festivals, all of that just to get to your audience.
In a big city like L.A. you can spend a lot of time surrounded by hundreds of people yet you feel like an alien or a ghost or something.
