American,Musician
Composing is my life blood.
That is basically me, and although I have done many things in my life - conducting, playing piano, and so on - what is fundamental is my being a composer.
I've always felt that music should be a normal part of the experience that surrounds people.
It's not a special taste. An American composer should have something to say to a cab driver.
