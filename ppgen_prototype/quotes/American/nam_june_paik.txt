Our life is half natural and half technological. Half-and-half is good. You cannot deny that high-tech is progress. We need it for jobs. Yet if you make only high-tech, you make war. So we must have a strong human element to keep modesty and natural life.
Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence.
The future is now.
