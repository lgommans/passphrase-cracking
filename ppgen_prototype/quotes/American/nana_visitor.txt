I don't get what my signature is supposed to mean if we haven't had some kind of exchange.
I would love to have seen a male-female relationship that had nothing to do with falling in love, I'd love to prove, even on TV - even if it's not true! - that men and women can be friends without any kind of involvement.
Now I'm going to put my eyelashes on and stretch my legs out and do a show.
The point of writing my name to you is that I see who you are, you see who I am... and that's what it's about.
