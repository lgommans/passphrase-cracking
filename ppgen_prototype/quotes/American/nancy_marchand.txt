American,Actress
I had spent my childhood making up adventures in my head. Then I realized when I went to acting school that there were adventures written down, and you could learn lines, and you could do the adventures for real, not just in your head.
I'm always very uncomfortable with people. It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe.
There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.
Acting was something I had to do.
I was a very shy, overly big, kind of creepy-looking kid.
I wasn't a glamour-puss, and there were more interesting roles for an actress like me in the theater and in live television.
