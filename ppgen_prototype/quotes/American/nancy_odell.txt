American,Celebrity
Marc if you want me to go to the bottom of the pool, I'll go there.
I'm so excited and honored to be part of 'Entertainment Tonight!' 'E.T.' was the show that started all the entertainment news, so I couldn't be more thrilled.
Sometimes I will tweet an interview I have coming up and ask my followers what questions they have for the celebrity. I feel that way I can really know first hand what people want to hear answered.
I just love Jamie Foxx!
I love to post behind-the-scenes photos of what is really going on. My twitter friends really seem to like that and the great thing is I can deliver them information right away.
Kids love to look at pictures of themselves.
We play tag and kickball almost every day. It's one of the ways that I've figured out how to spend some fun quality time with my kids while getting exercise.
I like to call it 'album making' because everybody hears the word scrapbooking and thinks, 'All the glue and the glitter - I don't have time for that!'
When I first got married to my husband, he had boxes full of photos of my two stepsons, ages 5 and 8 at the time, and I put them together in some little albums and wrote notes about how happy I was that they were a part of my life.
Family photo albums are so powerful in that they make kids feel valued, cherished and respected.
When you save book reports, art projects and put them in a scrapbook, it shows a kid you care and you are taking an interest in their lives.
To be honest, I haven't had a lot of time off.
You do have to overcome the child's thinking that this new woman, who is not their mother, is going to be in their lives.
