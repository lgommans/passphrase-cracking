To wait for hours to buy a train ticket or to see a doctor is accepted as a normal way of doing things. Privacy is not a great preoccupation, and this is a very crowded country.
The alarming thing in China is the almost total absence of primary care. Even in cities, there are no independent doctors' offices or neighborhood clinics, so people have to go to the hospital for every health care need.
I really enjoy doing sitcom television. It allows me to stay in Los Angeles and spend more time with my husband and kids.
'The Bill Engvall Show' is a comedy about a middle-class family in the Midwest. It's a great family show to watch if you want to laugh and unwind.
I wish my real life could be as simple and scripted as it is on television.
I love zoo sanctuaries.
I've probably said that in every feature I've been in. I've been repeatedly defined as the girlfriend or wife.
I want to do a show about a woman who's juggling a career with a relationship.
