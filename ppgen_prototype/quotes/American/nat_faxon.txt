There's something about the schedule of working in TV that's attractive. You know exactly what the next six months is going to be like: You'll work Monday through Friday and have the weekends off, and then there's going to be a hiatus here, so you can kind of plan a little bit.
The benefit of film is that you're shooting something for an intense period of time - and then it's over, and you move on to something else. In TV, you're doing the same thing over and over.
