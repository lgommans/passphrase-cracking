I actually love swimming but I just hate jumping in the water.
I live in a swimsuit so I'm really comfortable with my body.
I generally wake up at 4:30, have breakfast No. 1, then get to the pool by 5 a.m.
I don't have any superstitions, but what I always travel with is my pillow and my coffee.
I'm comfortable in the locker room situation, so whatever.
When I was little, I wasn't so little. I had a big old round belly and I was really clumsy, but I was super confident.
I was the official wedding photographer at one of my best friends' weddings. Fortunately she was one of the most easygoing brides ever, so she made it easy for me.
I very much looked up to Janet Evans and Summer Sanders.
The pressure of the Olympic Games is real overwhelming.
I hate how late we have our Olympic Trials, always have.
There's an adage that a lot of coaches have, that I completely disagree with, is if you make the Olympic team too early you become complacent.
I was tempted my junior year to go out of college and forgo my eligibility. I had broken several world records. I did have a lot of people telling me that I should go pro.
There's just something about that cold rush that I know I hate and a lot of other swimmers hate.
You see a lot of us lingering around. We'll just stand there on the edge of the pool and kinda psych ourselves up into getting in.
