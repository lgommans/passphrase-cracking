American,Actor
I married my high school sweetheart, and I do have two kids.
I feel like I was in the last graduating class of commercial actors.
Even through 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League,' I have yet to have that instant recognition and at such an early stage, where people totally didn't know my name, but they knew my face immediately.
People weren't willing to bet on 'The Commercial Guy' when they were casting movies and television in the beginning, but I stuck around, and now it's slowly starting to pay off.
I'd say specifically after 'Get Smart,' people now know me either as The Guy from 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League.' When that came out on DVD, everyone was recognizing me from that.
I had never heard of Cingular, but they needed people to jump on trampolines. Well, when I was 13, I was a trampoline gymnast. I had actually won nationals in my age group. So it was like one of those perfect, unbelievable miracles.
I specifically had my son wear a Browns jersey on the streets of Pittsburgh while we were there.
To be honest, I've just become a Steelers fan.
I loved my start. I'm proud of my spots. I don't feel embarrassed by anything that I did... It definitely helped me more than hurt me.
I feel like I was in the last graduating class of commercial actors. TiVo! I was out there before TiVo came out, man.
I'd say, specifically after 'Get Smart,' people now know me either as The Guy from 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League'; when that came out on DVD, everyone was recognizing me from that. But as far as the amount of people in a time, nothing touches when those Capital One commercials were playing.
