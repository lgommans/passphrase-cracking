American,Soldier
We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict.
I am not an enemy of the Negro. We want him here among us; he is the only laboring class we have.
Get there first with the most.
I've got no respect for any young man who won't join the colors.
No damn man kills me and lives.
War means fighting, and fighting means killing.
Never stand and take a charge... charge them too.
I ended the war a horse ahead.
