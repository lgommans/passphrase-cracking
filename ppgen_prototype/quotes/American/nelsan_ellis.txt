With 'True Blood,' you don't know what to expect. You don't know how wild it's gonna get.
I love working with Alexander Skarsgard. He brings such gravity to a scene.
But no one told me that when you're in the military, they own you.
I'd always dabbled in acting.
I was quiet. If I really wanted to say something, I would. I just wasn't interested in saying anything.
When I moved to Chicago, I was coming from a school that didn't have any arts in Alabama. I essentially came from a town where the arts didn't exist and the desire for education didn't exist and wasn't valued.
