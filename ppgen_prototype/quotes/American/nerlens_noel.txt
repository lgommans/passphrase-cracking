I think I'm mostly looking forward to the college life. I'm looking forward to more freedom. Here everything is really structured and scheduled, but in college you've got to be more responsible and you can get things done on your own time. I'm really looking forward to that.
Anyone who knows me knows my mom, Dorcina, has to sign off on any decision and that she will play a major part in any decision.
I look at Syracuse and I love the way that the coaches say they'll use me in their offense. I really like the family atmosphere there and I feel really comfortable there.
Then you've got Georgetown, and I really just like everything about them. When I went down there with my mom, it really opened my eyes to what they were all about. I have to factor in what a school like that can do for me, even away from being a basketball player.
By now everyone knows that I picked Kentucky, and I am definitely happy with my decision and that it's all finally over.
My goals for next year are to win a national title first and foremost.
Then I want to beat Anthony Davis' shot-block record, and I want to win National Player of the Year. I definitely plan to put the work in to accomplish those goals.
It's just a great school and they have a history of developing big men. Georgetown is definitely a great option for me.
