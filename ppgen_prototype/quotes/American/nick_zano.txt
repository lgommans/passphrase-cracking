I think to love somebody every day for a long period of time is the most romantic thing you can do.
One of the things I noticed about the '2 Broke Girls' pilot was that it looked like a new episode in a season and not a pilot, and that's an amazing sign.
In TV, you usually don't get a chance to fix anything. It's always easier to cancel something than fix it.
