Working out, for me, is sort of a meditation.
One guy wanted an outline of my foot. Another guy wanted locks of my hair.
For all the concern about bodies and weight, 'Baywatch' has three huge catering trucks on the set at all times. One for entrees, one appetizers and one for junk food.
When short guys start working out to bulk up. I like muscles, but I don't like really buff guys.
I love meeting 'the Odd Man Out' - like fans of 'Baywatch' who regret, as I do, that Tower 12 Productions didn't put nearly as much energy into writing and directing the show as they put into photographing and editing it.
I've heard The Demolitionist described, premise-wise, as 'RoboCop' meets 'The Crow' by way of 'La Femme Nikita'. That, as I see it, could not be more accurate.
The bathing suits they had me wear on Baywatch were all one-pieces, which kill my figure.
