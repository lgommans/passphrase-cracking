I had never written anything before in my life except maybe in high school when I wrote a short story, and my mother had to put an ending on that.
I'd always been a big reader. I credit my mom for giving me my love of reading.
I've always loved horses. I had one horse when I was in high school, but I had to sell him because we moved to Germany, and it ripped my heart out, so I never wanted to go through that pain again. When we moved to Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky, I was able to ride then.
I've found that readers of historical romances really like series because they get to revisit characters and find out what happens with them. I've done several series.
