I'm definitely not a football player, but I can play one for a season.
I definitely think that comedy is my niche.
I was studying to be a dental hygienist and working as a dental assistant. I met a photographer and decided to put my job on hold for just a summer to begin modeling.
I learned how to play football and I got pretty good at it. I enjoyed being on a team with other girls. In Hollywood, girls are always competing against one another, so it was nice to be on a team with other girls for a change.
Guys that play videogames are hot!
