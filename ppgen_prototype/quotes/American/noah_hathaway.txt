Harley's been influential, but I'm not a big Harley fan.
With Harley, you build it, then you've got to take it apart.
In L.A., everybody ain't so nice.
This is really showing me what certain movies mean to people.
I'm trying to open a Chopper shop this year.
So we're going to do a Battlestar Galactica themed bike and bring another one of the bikes.
It's a little weird exchanging pictures for money. You know what I mean. It makes me a little uncomfortable.
We had a showing of Battlestar in LA last week. I walked out the door and there were 50 people. I signed a ton of autographs. Other actors walked away without signing. These are the fans. I guess it depends. on who you are.
I'm a martial arts buff, so anything martial arts.
I speak French fluently, so that really helped.
I'm an action fanatic.
I'm not a huge drama person. I think I liked them more when I was younger.
Now, I'm getting a little older, got more responsibility, I don't need to be depressed.
I don't want to sit and cry for an hour in a movie. I'd rather have an action or a comedy.
My father was a writer and an acting teacher.
I'd have to say the whole experience in making The Neverending Story. I had an incredible time.
I would like any type of character that I could be creative with and totally delve into.
Atreyu comes from a land called Fantasia. It's an imaginary land.
I mean, there are things in the book you could never do in a movie.
Well, TV series tie you up. You can't do films while you're doing a TV series.
I'd rather do a lot of movies than a TV series and do a lot of different roles than be stuck in one TV thing.
