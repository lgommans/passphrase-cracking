Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm schizophrenic, and so am I.
There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.
Happiness isn't something you experience; it's something you remember.
I'm a study of a man in chaos in search of frenzy.
Once I make up my mind, I'm full of indecision.
Every time I look at you I get a fierce desire to be lonesome.
What the world needs is more geniuses with humility; there are so few of us left.
There are two sides to every question: my side and the wrong side.
Schizophrenia beats dining alone.
I don't drink. I don't like it. It makes me feel good.
A politician is a man who will double cross that bridge when he comes to it.
The only difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats allow the poor to be corrupt, too.
I've given up reading books. I find it takes my mind off myself.
Underneath this flabby exterior is an enormous lack of character.
I have no trouble with y enemies. But my god damn friends... they are the ones that keep me walking the floors at night.
I envy people who drink - at least they know what to blame everything on.
I am no more humble than my talents require.
So little time and so little to do.
I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.
Once Dwight Eisenhower makes up his mind, he's full of indecision.
I have given up reading books; I find it takes my mind off myself.
I think a lot of Bernstein - but not as much as he does.
Behind the phony tinsel of Hollywood lies the real tinsel.
Strip away the phony tinsel of Hollywood and you'll find the real tinsel underneath.
