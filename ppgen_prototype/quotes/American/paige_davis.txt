The best thing about New York is everything is available. Whatever you want, New York has got it!
I'm basically for the whole year just traveling with three suitcases.
I think even when homeowners love their room, it's still a shock, because you left your house, went to sleep, came home and your room was dramatically and drastically different.
These rooms are decorated in two days. It's all kept secret. The neighbors spend the night in each other's home. They don't see their finished room until the end of the second day. They have no say what happens in their own home.
You really can't turn on TLC without seeing us.
