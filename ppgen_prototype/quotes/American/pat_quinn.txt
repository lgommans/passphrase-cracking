American,Politician
I have a job to do on policy. And I think that's what people want their governor to do. Not politics, policy.
I will never be an insider. I want to be the champion of people who don't have insiders and lobbyists supporting them.
I don't aspire to have high approval ratings. I aspire, in light of my two predecessors, to be the most honest governor I can be. I'd rather focus on honesty than popularity.
