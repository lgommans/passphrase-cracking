I am not a gamer. Not since the days of Atari.
I've always been interested in the gangster genre, so to play Mickey Cohen was a real thrill. It's always fun to do your take on someone so iconic.
I love things that people hate. I hate middle-of-the-road stuff. It never really interests me.
I do a lot of shows I've actually never seen, and I hadn't seen 'Castle' or 'Scandal,' but it's fun to just go into someone's world for eight days and do your thing, and then leave.
'Mad Men' still lives in my life as the best job that I've ever had because I thought the character was genius. It was so well-written.
I would love to play a regular guy in a family drama.
I totally respond to complex characters, and I'm not interested in anything too simple.
