American,Businessman
Only my phone number and email are private because I don't want random people calling me. But I like the ability to share everything.
The companies that are the most influential and most successful are the ones that care about impact and the influence they have on the world.
I like writing code. I like building product. I like making things that people like.
I'm just more excited about helping new entrepreneurs create the next Facebook or Google.
I think the best kind of virality is a product that people like so much that they just want to tell people about it.
I look to see what things I enjoy doing and just try to figure out how to spend my time doing things that I enjoy.
We created the 'Like' feature in FriendFeed because I realized that people wanted an easy way to let others know that they saw what their friends posted and appreciated it. Putting in those simple little gestures is very powerful.
Google is about information and computers and making things really fast. Facebook is about the sharing and connections. These missions give these companies direction and motivation.
