I think I'm better than all the people who are trying to reform me.
They want to create rather than decimate.
A lot of people relate me to the blues but I don't think it's a hindrance at this point. I've been doing it long enough that I can do different things and be accepted.
I guess if you stay around long enough, they can't get rid of you.
