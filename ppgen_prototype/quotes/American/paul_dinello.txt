Any filmmaker who has translated some personal vision into a film that actually gets shot and distributed is wildly successful. Congratulations! Anything after that is gravy.
I felt like there was a certain standard that we held 'Strangers' to, so I think about that whenever I work on something.
It's never easy getting an independent film made and distributed - even when it's easy.
I don't think any of us think of ourselves as artists or actors - clowns, we'll accept that label.
