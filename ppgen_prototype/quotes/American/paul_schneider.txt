American,Actor
I feel strongly about showing up and being prepared and not taking the opportunity for granted and being conscientious about my fellow co-workers.
I come from a really lovely, really smart family where the only stress was money and employment.
What the entertainment industry can do is tempt you into making stupid mistakes, but the only tool that they have to tempt you is money. So if you're okay saying no to money, then you can say no to a lot of things that you might be embarrassed of later.
I was really affected by 'The Piano.' Had I not seen that movie, I wouldn't have gone to film school.
When I do a job, I do it 100 percent. I am so grateful for the chance to do what I do.
I didn't grow up wanting to be an actor, and I didn't go to acting school.
If I ever stop acting, I'd like to be the author of that decision.
