I was the captain of the pompom squad but not the cheerleading squad. There's a difference. The Peary Poms were the best in the state.
Really, life is so short. I can't believe I do this for a living. It's just unbelievable that Paula from Rockville, captain of the Peary pompom squad, can do this. It's the greatest thing ever.
'Snoops,' that was the worst.
I think I was a pretty normal kid. I wasn't the prom queen, but I wasn't a freak, either.
I think it's rare to get on a show that lasts.
I've said no to shows that have been on the air for six years because they weren't what I wanted to do.
A lot of shows, like 'Cupid,' that I loved with all my heart, it shouldn't have been canceled.
I don't think I was ever responsible for anything being canceled.
I feel really fortunate that people keep hiring me. People think I have talent.
I'm going to get T-shirts made that say 'Paula Marshall is Not a Show Killer.'
