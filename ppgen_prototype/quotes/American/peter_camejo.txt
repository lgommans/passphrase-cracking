I really think the Patriot Act violates our Constitution. It was, it is, an illegal act. The Congress, the Senate and the president cannot change the Constitution.
No one in their right mind can say to me with a straight face that the Patriot Act has not aggregated the Fourth Amendment.

We must have a fair tax in the United States. We have to re-adjust it, we must be fiscally responsible.
