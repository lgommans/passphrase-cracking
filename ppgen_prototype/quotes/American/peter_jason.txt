American,Actor
It's funny, but on a set there's a pecking order. There's a caste system, you know? It goes from the star down to the extra. That includes the crew as well. I've never liked that.
I've always felt that, in America, we're all equal. I don't care what you make or what kind of car you drive. You're not better than me.
I think everybody's the same. I think we're all entitled to our space, and I like to treat everybody like that.
