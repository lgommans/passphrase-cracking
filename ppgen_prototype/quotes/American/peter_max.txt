American,Artist
If I didn't choose art, I would have become an astronomer.
I never know what I'm going to put on the canvas. The canvas paints itself. I'm just the middleman.
Angela King is a lovely person with a tremendous sense of art.
There's nothing like New Orleans. When it comes back, it will be a tremendous highlight for America.
The '60s were an amazing time.
I walked out with 14 advertising projects.
When I am in New York, you know, my studio is big, about 20,000 to 25,000 square feet, and I have painting rooms and rooms I do etching in, rooms I do lithographs.
All day long, I'm creative, and the second I get a little tired of any given medium, I just shut that area down and go to the next room. I just go do something else.
I have 17 full-time archivists working for me who put away in books all the diversity of artwork I do, from drawing to etching to monotypes to prints to lithographs.
I kind of love my work. I really love the pieces I do.
