American,Soldier
Today's tactical victory does not guarantee tomorrow's strategic success.
Tell it like it is.
I have to use the word 'insurgent' because I can't think of a better word right now.
From 8,000 miles away... I would not judge a fellow soldier from a friendly nation and how they are employing their resources.
Intelligence we gathered at the time indicated that this was in fact leadership and we struck the leadership.
Marines are very good at fighting... And if Gen. Franks wants fighters on the ground and he puts Marines in, he'll have what he wants.
Surrender your forces and give yourselves and your troops the opportunity to be a part of Iraq's future and not a part of Iraq's past.
The bottom line is that after we defeat the armed forces of Iraq, that we will want to and need to provide stability throughout that country.
There has not yet been a major ground offensive battle... There are, we know, negotiations going on between the opposition forces and the Taliban leadership for surrender.
We prefer that the leaders of the Iraqi armed forces do the honorable thing; stop fighting for a regime that does not deserve your loyalty.
I believe that homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts. I do not believe that the Armed Forces of the United States are well served by a saying through our policies that it's OK to be immoral in any way.
I can tell you categorically that any mal-treatment of any detainees by U.S. forces or coalition forces is totally unacceptable - that our orders have and will continue to be that we will treat everyone in our charge with - humanely and with respect.
Iraq and Afghanistan will, over time, become stable. But the War on Terror will continue long after Iraq and Afghanistan have had success in standing up their own governments.
