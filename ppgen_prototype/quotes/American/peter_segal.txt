American,Director
I would love to see Steven Spielberg working. I just think he's the greatest living director.
I never put down a bad script and I never walk out of a bad movie because I'm always hopeful things will change.
I'm very spiritual and I'm Jewish by faith. I'm not a practising Jew, I'm more of a recreational Jew. I celebrate the holidays and I try to inform my kids about their heritage because I think we all at some point have to defend our heritage and if they get picked on I want them to know why.
Some people are like cats - if they're dropped upside down, they land on their feet. I get a little irritated about stories like that.
I kind of don't like doing film commentaries because I think they're kind of weird.
The rules I go by are: Always keep your villains bad, and keep the plot grounded and real. If you keep those stakes, the comedy will bounce off that and work.
I think superheroes are heroes with flaws, and in their flaws, there is a sense of humor.
