The integrity of the game is everything.
Baseball is a public trust. Players turn over, owners turn over and certain commissioners turn over. But baseball goes on.
A cloud hangs over baseball. It's a cloud called drugs and it's permeated our game.
Other sports play once a week but this sport is with us every day.
It's not, 'We have a city to bid, now let's go check in with the federal government'.
The international game has changed for bidding cities.
The state is out of control, the state is on a spending binge, the state has to stop putting itself in a hole that's getting deeper and deeper and deeper.
This is America's Team and we are confident this outstanding group of athletes will make our country proud.
