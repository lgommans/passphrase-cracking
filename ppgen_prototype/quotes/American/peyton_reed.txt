American,Director
I've always been a DVD geek and, before that, a laser disc fanatic, too.
I came from a background of directing behind-the-scenes documentaries.
I think there's actually a benefit to working with teen actors: they've got such boundless energy, and everybody is willing to try different things.
I hate when there's a deleted scene on a DVD with no explanation, or you have to go out of your way to find an alternate audio track.
As a Marvel fan who grew up with 'The Avengers' and 'Ant-Man' and everything, I definitely have my own sort of feelings about what I want to see as a fan in an 'Ant-Man' movie.
You cannot separate sexuality from cheerleading. It is inherently what it is - growing up with the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and all of that stuff.
What I loved about 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin,' the title is the easy sell, but when you see the movie, the comedy is more free-form and more relatable.
I think with any movie, the more you know, it loses some of its power.
When you look at Kennedy and Nixon, TV played a crucial part in Kennedy's popularity. He was incredibly photogenic, while Nixon was this scowling figure. American viewers judged him on his appearance on TV.
I forgive 'Face in the Crowd' its uneven tone because it's precisely what makes it feel unlike other Kazan movies.
Maybe I have an affinity for Andy Griffith because we both grew up in North Carolina.
'A Face in the Crowd' is Elia Kazan's forgotten movie.
I love turning on the computer in the morning and reading the things that I did the day before - that I didn't do!
I always loved as a kid reading 'Spider-Man,' and the 'Fantastic Four' would show up... it was all about that larger universe.
