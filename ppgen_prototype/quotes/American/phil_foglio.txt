I didn't really think about becoming a professional artist until high school, when I realized that everything else required too much math.
If we had to go live action, I'd hold out for Tim Burton to direct.
As it happened, I had a friend who was a good person who liked to present himself as a dreadful one. Using him as a role model, I created the first Buck Godot strip.
One of the characteristics I cherish in my friends is their childlike gullibility, and several excited minutes were spent trying to actually find this book.
Why the hell can't people just write nice happy stories about people having happy sex? That's what I want, and I bet a whole bunch of other people want it too.
I've also been busy doing stuff for Steve Jackson Games.
My only requirement for that first story was that there had to be a fight or an explosion on every page. Naturally, no one wanted to publish it, but I liked the character, did a few stories to keep my hand in.
We start out talking about the story, trying to figure out who is who and what should happen, taking notes the whole time. Then I do a rough layout of the issue, showing what happens on each page. Then we discuss that some more.
