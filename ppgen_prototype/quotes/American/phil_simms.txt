I haven't thought about it. I'm not capable of deep thinking.
I criticize a lot of players and coaches. But I back it up with facts. A lot of times guys get mad at me because someone told them what I said. I say, 'You're wrong: Go check the tape.'
Talk radio has almost ruined the sports fan.
Of course it looks bad when you're not executing. When things go bad, it's not going to look good.
I'm not a guy that believes you've got to have a lot of experience to have success in the playoffs.
Sometimes, it's good to have a tremendous star, because everyone understands he has to get the ball.
