American,Musician
I play blues old-timey style.
I grew up hard. I picked cotton and plowed with the mule and fixed the cars and played with the guitar and the piano.
What I learned I learned on my own. I didn't have much school. Three years.
I taught myself off records, Memphis Slim, them old piano players, then added to it. Yeah, hard and loud, beat it to pieces.
What little family I got is in Mississippi. A whole lot of them died before I left, and my sister died a long time ago, before my mama did.
I play any piano with a good tune.
