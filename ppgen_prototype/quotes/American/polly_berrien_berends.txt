Parenthood always comes as a shock. Postpartum blues? Postpartum panic is more like it. We set out to have a baby; what we get is a total take-over of our lives.
We can see that the baby is as much an instrument of nourishment for us as we are for him.
The parent is the strongest statement that the child hears regarding what it means to be alive and real. More than what we say or do, the way we are expresses what we think it means to be alive. So the articulate parent is less a telling than a listening individual.
The gain is not the having of children; it is the discovery of love and how to be loving.
A sense of worthiness is a child's most important need.
Most of us would do more for our babies than we have ever been willing to do for anyone, even ourselves.
