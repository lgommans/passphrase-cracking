American,Politician
I have met hundreds of young people doing just what George Romney did: using a hand up in tough times to become part of the American Dream.
My father ran a corner drug store where he worked night and day, seven days a week, until he died of a stroke. He literally worked himself to death.
Politicians make mistakes. People misspeak in public. God knows I have proven both. A lot.
