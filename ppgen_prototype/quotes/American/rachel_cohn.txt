American,Author
Usually my characters, though young, tend to be street-wise.
I've always been sort of a closet sci-fi geek.
I am a classic 'Star Trek' fanatic.
I feel like there's so much darkness in all of my books.
When I was a teenager, the number one book I was most obsessed with was 'Gone with the Wind.'
I am a classic Star Trek fanatic. When I was a kid, my mom and I used to go to conventions.
No one would want to read a book in which I explain the science of cloning because it would be very dull and it would also make no sense.
