American,Writer
I didn't choose to write a military man as much as Vince Haven chose me.
I finished 'The Hunger Games' trilogy, and I love most anything with zombies.
'Rescue Me' is the first book in a three-book series. Although, like all my series, the books are purposely written so that readers do not have to read them in order.
Each time I reach a goal or read a great review, I am beyond pleased.
The expectation was that 'True Confessions' would be my first published book, but that didn't happen. After it was rejected by every publisher in New York and Canada, I shoved it in a closet and went on to write and publish my next three books.
I write romance because I love to read romance.
The first book I sat down to write was an historical romance. It was really bad and thankfully no one ever saw it.
