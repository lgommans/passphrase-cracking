You can't take the New York out of the girl. It's like a little country girl coming to the big city.
I've never had an audition like that before. They don't let you know about anything on 'Mad Men,' because it's a spoiler for everybody. I thought I was on the right track when I was cracking everybody up.
Maybe some mornings, you come to my house, you'll see 'Miss Blankenship' come out of bed. I'm waiting for that spinoff.
Twitter, Facebook are so different from where I began. It's like a fire that takes off... I'm reading everybody's Twitter.
I've been in this business for 40 years - you do a show, and you don't know what's going to come of it.
It's good just to laugh sometimes, and if it comes out of some truth, it's even stronger.
I hate when people use this term, but Matt Weiner is a genius.
Seriously, I do a lot of yoga, so I'm in control of my body.
I dropped out of the business for 8 years, and I taught English as a second language. Then I decided to go back to acting, and I got 'Mad Men'.
To my surprise, I have an Emmy nomination, and I have never even been to the Emmys! So it's like I am Cinderella. But actually having thought about it, I am Cinder-elder!
