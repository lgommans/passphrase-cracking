American,Actor
I had always been a fatalist about my career. What was to be was to be.
My retirement is both voluntary and involuntary. One reason, and this is voluntary, is the impact of television. All old movies are turning up on television, and frankly, making pictures doesn't interest me anymore. Another reason is that the film industry is in a declining state.
Westerns are a type of picture which everybody can see and enjoy. Westerns always make money. And they always increase a star's fan following.
Frankly, I don't like publicity.
I'm a great believer in fate. I think things happen in spite of, and despite, yourself.
