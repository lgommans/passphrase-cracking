Being a wrestler is like walking on the treadmill of life. You get off it and it just keeps going.
Every sport has its own cast of characters.
From wrestling to my hip-hop thing, I've just been able to do so much and meet so many crazy characters.
I used to hate old-timers who didn't praise the younger wrestlers, but you've got to pass the torch sometime. If you're old, that torch gets too heavy for you and you can't carry it, so it won't do you any good.
There are no tough guys in wrestling.
I've been loving music all my life.
