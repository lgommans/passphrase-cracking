I just smile. And they - my opponents don't like it when I smile at them. They think I'm playing or something. But - like I smile throughout the whole fight. Sometimes I'll be throwing combinations and I just smile and stick my tongue out at them.
I could have gone professional, but I'm not giving up on my dream.
I put a lot of fire in my punches.
It's fun when you're winning and performing well, but it's also hard because now you get older, you got responsibilities.
Every fighter has to go in there with a game plan.
Basically, as a leader, I try not to make any mistakes, because there's a lot of people watching even though you don't think so.
I always had the theory that if you have a dream, chase it. And I'm chasing it.
I've got over three-hundred pairs of shoes back home - I'm twenty-four years old and I wear a size four, so all my shoes are just cheap.
My nickname is Nuke.
I got to fight every second, every minute and every round.
