They call it golf because all the other four-letter words were taken.
If I play my best, I can win anywhere in the world against anybody.
If you travel first class, you think first class and you are more likely to play first class.
Guys get voted into the Hall of Fame who don't belong, who lack the numbers. I'm very upset at the Hall of Fame for that. It's not fair to the people who went in early.
One major should not get you into the Hall of Fame - maybe one major and 40 wins. I'm not gonna pick a guy with one major and 11 wins.
