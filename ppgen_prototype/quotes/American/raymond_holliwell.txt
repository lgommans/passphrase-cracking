No matter what we want of life we have to give up something in order to get it.
The inner thought coming from the heart represents the real motives and desires. These are the cause of action.
Understanding reduces the greatest to simplicity, and lack of its causes the least to take on the magnitude.
To give your best is to receive the best.
God does not require you to follow His leadings on blind trust. Behold the evidence of an invisible intelligence pervading everything, even your own mind and body.
You must see first before you can believe.
Are we controlled by our thoughts, or are we controlling our thoughts?
Desire creates the power.
