It's funny how getting older - or being overlooked and underrated for more than two decades - can make you change your ambitions.
My dad was career Army.
I grew up on army bases all over the world, but I'm from Alabama.
In Alabama, we have ribs with a white sauce, which is really great.
The idea of ignoring your past, only to confront it later in life, is a familiar experience whether you come here from Hungary or French Canada or Ireland.
I think horror or science fiction is another way of telling a modern myth - it's like Ancient Greece; it's like kids couldn't wait for the next 'Orpheus' story, the next 'Jason and the Argonauts.'
I was told I wasn't black enough for certain jobs because of the way I speak and carry myself and because I was raised in Europe. It's why I left L.A.
The world is being destroyed by psychopaths, so of all the things to be concerned about - acting, it's not really up there, is it?
I don't barbeque myself because that would involve me cooking. And whereas I can, I'm not a very good cook.
There's something about being around a long time that puts stuff in perspective.
