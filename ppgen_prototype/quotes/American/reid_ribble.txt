American,Politician
I think if more members of Congress would talk about what they see and what they want to do and what they want to accomplish, rather than talking about their opponent, we would begin to shape and reshape American public opinion on what the political world looks like.
Nobody should be surprised that Republicans vote for Republican policy. Just like Democrats vote for Democrat policy.
My first campaign was pretty ugly: the incumbent came after me hard with a lot of things that weren't true.
For me to get out in the congressional district that I represent and see all the things that we manufacture there, produce there, to get to know its people better, its businesses better and its government leaders better, all of those things have enriched me.
