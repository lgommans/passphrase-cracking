I didn't know a soul when I got to New York, and I felt really displaced. The first week I was euphoric, and then I realized how isolating the city can be.
I like alternative music, so I like to hear new bands.
I love my neighborhood: There are Russian families, the artistic community, the gay community, and industry professionals - all ethnicities and ages are represented. That's the kind of neighborhood that I grew up in.
