My son's the most precious thing to me; he's changed me from being selfish to selfless.
I love my son, but my daughter has calmed me down.
I have experienced firsthand the tremendous impact breast cancer has on the women who fight it and the loved ones who support them. This is a disease that catches you unaware and, without the right resources, leaves you feeling frightened and alone.
I don't go to a lot of parties or do a lot of going out within, like, the Hollywood circle or celebrity-type circles and things like that.
Sure, I'm ashamed of a lot of the things I did, but at the same time, I wouldn't be the person I am today if I hadn't gone through those experiences.
My daughter gets to paint my nails and put clips in my hair, and I love it.
