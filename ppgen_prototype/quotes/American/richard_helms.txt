The real problem is arranging that experience in a way that tells a story, which is just incredible enough to be interesting, but credible enough to be believed.
I had seen so many injustices done in the court by well-meaning people. I had lost fourteen clients to gang violence in only seven years. I was angry at a system I thought had failed my clients, and I was part of it.
It was my angry, Dickensian novel, I suppose. It was cathartic - I expended a lot of frustration on that one.
As soon as I finished the first book, I wrote a second, which I hope to sell this year, and I have just about finished the third book in the series. Two more are already outlined. I'm in this for the long haul.
