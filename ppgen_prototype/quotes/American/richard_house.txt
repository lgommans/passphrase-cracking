It wasn't my intention ever to leave Chicago, that's for sure.
When I started writing the third book, 'The Kill,' the intention was just to write a thriller, a crime novel for myself, really, in which there would be no body, no solution - where you would look at an event from different people's perspectives.
I definitely saw 'The Kill,' when I started it, as an entertainment.
When I first started writing, I wrote a book called 'Bruiser,' and it was pretty much set in Chicago.
