I don't watch the dailies. You want to just turn in your resignation when you watch the dailies.
When I was a kid, I loved horror films. I used to stay up on Saturday night to watch.
A Western would be good. I'd love to do a Western.
Any time you die in a film, it's not real, so it's all kind of fun.
But I loved making 'Eat Pray Love,' and I loved working with Julia Roberts.
I like relaxed sets. I like to feel that I can make a mistake without feeling like I'm costing somebody money. I like a sense of freedom. I like it when people are open and are willing to let you do your work.
When there is tension, arguments and money problems, it's tough to do your work. Some people thrive on that. I don't.
There's nothing like walking onto a Hollywood sound stage.
