I felt like a hunted animal, followed constantly, waiting to be killed.
I want my name back.
While the government can tell you that I am an innocent man, the government's letter cannot give me back my good name or my reputation.
It's a bomb. I've already called law enforcement. Let's get out of here.
I'm sure they're investigating everyone who was in the area.
I believe I am entitled to a public explanation.
