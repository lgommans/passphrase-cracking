My political view really comes from a biblical perspective.
I'm conservative in my thought. I'm conservative in my theology. I'm conservative in my politics.
I'm not only a Christian, but I'm a pastor of a church.
When we started Poco, we were too country for rock, and we were too rock for country.
I don't really listen to much music.
Put me on the river, put me on the golf course, put me on the stage - I'm having fun.
Bonnaroo is the most significant festival in the country. I can sometimes just get caught up in the moment and listening and say, 'Oops, I gotta go sing now.'
I see so many people. They just seem to be hopeless. Being a Christian and being a pastor, the ultimate hope is in Jesus.
