I can't live without my milk. We get 3 gallons every time we go shopping, and I finish it in two weeks. I drink maybe five cups a day.
I think peas are really nasty. I liked them when I was younger, but I guess when you get older you have different taste buds.
For as long as I've been acting, I have been very lucky to be paired with really great actresses playing my mom.
Naturally, people are curious about how my real mom feels about me having a TV mom.
When I was going on auditions, it was nerve-racking. I'd always say to my mom that it would be awesome if I could get a series. When Modern Family came along, I said, 'You know what, Mom? I believe I'm going to get this role.'
I just started watching wrestling in 2008, and I've loved it ever since. I told my mom I wanted to become a wrestler.
I love being on 'Modern Family.' One of my favorite things is looking forward to going to work every day.
I don't write poems. I don't give flowers to girls... yet.
I go for crunchy things - I like green beans, broccoli, asparagus, celery and carrots. I'm not a fruit eater, though.
My mom taught me how to make grilled chicken, and I bake, too.
