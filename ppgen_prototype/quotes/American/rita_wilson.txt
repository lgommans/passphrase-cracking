You've got to want to be married to the person you're married to.
Awareness is empowering.
I'm not trying to prove anything.
Performing live actually thrills me. Just get me a stage, get me a mic, and I'm going to be happy.
I always wanted to sing. I didn't know how to do it. I didn't know how to make the singing thing happen.
I've played so many moms, best friends, sisters and understanding people.
The Greek side of me definitely loves a good meal, a lot of laughing, loud discussions.
As a woman, I feel women get the shaft all the time.
My mother is Greek and my father is Bulgarian. I am a first-generation American and native Los Angeleno. I was born and raised in Hollywood.
I would go to school and be American and then come home and be Greek.
I always did sing. It's always been something I love to do but it has also been the most private and most secret thing that you don't really want to let the world in on.
