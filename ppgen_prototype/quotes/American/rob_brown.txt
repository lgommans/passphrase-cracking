I realize I'm an ambitious guy, but I just try to take things as they come, you know, for the most part.
You think you want to be an astronaut, and then after a while you're a geo-major for whatever reason. That's just the way it is in college.
I'm not opposed to anything. If an opportunity comes across, I'll answer the door if it comes knocking.
I would like to be remembered as a responsible human being who handled business while also taking care of his family.
I know I'm not going to book everything I go in on, and that's just the nature of the business. You have to keep hustling and not get down on it. You have to keep at it and find your way in. Everybody's story is different.
