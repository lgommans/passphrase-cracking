We dominated Survivor - there is no way we would not dominate that, too. I can see it already, us making deals with people. That's the best part, and with the Race, it would be even more fun because I've got a lot of tricks up my sleeve.
I just basically took a chance because it looked like fun and I wanted the .
I have been able to travel all over the country and see many places that I probably never would have visited. I have also participated in many charity events for worthy causes.
Things have slowed down considerably since the new series has started airing and I am currently looking for work. It has been a nice year-long vacation nonetheless.
I am biased to my show as a whole but it is still very entertaining.
Who knows, I have always lived one day at a time. Probably more adventure and excitement.
I'm a kid from Boston.
The one thing that I'm in charge of in this wedding is the food.
I always thought I would have boys, but as a father, when your kids are born and they're healthy and happy, that's the most important thing.
I'm a competitor!
I think people have come to know me, and I don't deviate too much as an individual. What you see is what you get.
I love adventure, so I'm excited to be working on something new and making the transition from reality show contestant to host.
I know I'm not musically talented.
Learning to drive is a scary thing for a parent. I had to basically lie to get the keys when I was a kid.
Sometimes when the going gets tough, people give up.
