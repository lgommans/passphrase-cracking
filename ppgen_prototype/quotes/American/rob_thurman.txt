I need it all: in-depth characterization, fantastic/warped world building, a plot that could out-race Secretariat, and a 'voice.' I need to hear a uniqueness in the author's voice.
Writing monsters is fun, and it's easy. When I want one, I just reach under the bed and pull it out, kicking and screaming.
Don't accept what's out there because that is all that's out there. Look for the new and unusual. Seek out what you genuinely want to read and don't settle.
I love Urban Fantasy, even though I'm inevitably compared to 'Supernatural,' only a little more edgy.
