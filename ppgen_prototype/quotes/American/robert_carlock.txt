I got a lot of incredible experience at 'Friends.' I was there when it was the No. 1 show in the country. And I was a very small part of that.
I will never begin to know what the accountants do or what the camera guys do, as much as I try to learn just out of respect for what they do and to try to make my job as manager more efficient. The most important thing is to let those people do their jobs while making it clear what the parameters are.
