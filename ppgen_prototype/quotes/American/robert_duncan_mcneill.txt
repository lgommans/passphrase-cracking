A lot of fans know that I love motorcycles. That's a big love of mine. I could spend days on the bike if I had the time.
The comedy in 'Star Trek' is always very subtle, if it's there at all.
One week, you can have a real heavy romance 'Chuck' episode, and the next week it can be some kind of murdery mystery. It's not like doing a procedural.
Zach Levi has a huge heart.
I directed an early episode of 'Supernatural' the first season called 'Skin.'
The first season, 'Supernatural' was very anthology-like. It was like a scary story of the week that the brothers would solve.
I always loved working in comedy.
