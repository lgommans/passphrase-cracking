American,Actor
I started acting when I got a summer job at the Everyman Theater Company with the Neighborhood Youth Corps.
I want to be remembered as a loving, understanding father.
If you really love acting, you'll want to act. That's what I did. You don't look for any payday because the likelihood of a payday is slim to none.
What effect am I having on this world? I'm not sure yet. I have my worries, doubts and fears, but the way I'm trying to affect the world is with positive, right action.
