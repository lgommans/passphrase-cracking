American,Artist
Some people like to paint trees. I like to paint love. I find it more meaningful than painting trees.
I think of my peace paintings as one long poem, with each painting being a single stanza.
I realize that protest paintings are not exactly in vogue, but I've done many.
I was the least Pop of all the Pop artists.
I've always been fascinated by numbers. Before I was seventeen years old, I had lived in twenty-one different houses. In my mind, each of those houses had a number.
I never had the exposure to techniques and so forth that children have today with art workshops, but I always had crayons and pencils and still have work going right back to when I was five or six years old.
Many, many of my paintings have come from the first chapter of Moby Dick.
