I've always felt happy at Newcastle. But things have gone a bit differently for me since we got a new manager.
Charlton are a team who play well on the ball, but they found it hard to break us down, they didn't really have an out and out chance in front of our goal.
With Andy Cole up front they can score at any time. We'll be watching him very closely.
The teams who play against us don't give us any gifts, but we were too kind.
It's important to score some goals and make the decisive pass for my club.
