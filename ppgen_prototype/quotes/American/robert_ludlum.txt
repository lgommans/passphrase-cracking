American,Novelist
Characterization is integral to the theatrical experience.
I don't believe that my first name is Leo or that my last name is Tolstoy. I'm a storyteller.
Greater economic power will be in the hands of too few.
Life is extremely complicated.
I have always preferred conflict of individuals over the battle of extreme ideologies.
A theater person should know what holds an audience and what does not.
I try as best I can to enter the realm of nuances of human behavior.
I start every book with something that outrages me. I'm outraged by the FBI, the CIA, and computers that seem to have catalogued our lives. Power too often is accompanied by irresponsibility.
