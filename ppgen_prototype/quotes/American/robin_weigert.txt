I'm curious about people, and I'm curious about getting to the root of where they might be coming from.
I think when I feel fear, that's often a cue that I should do something. If I begin to feel fear, that's a strong sign, psychologically, that something has its hooks in me somewhere deep.
In 'Deadwood,' it was just extremely unaesthetic. They actually put underarm merkins on and covered me with dirt!
Television has changed. Some feels like good old-fashioned TV, and some of it feels more filmic and more natural and more nuanced. I don't think there's any clear line any longer between film and TV.
It's such an obedient way to be for a woman, to try to keep yourself in top shape, to follow all the rules and hope that will get you a measure of stability or happiness. That's part of the affluent suburban dream: to do everything perfectly in a long-winded way, to try to fulfill all the requirements.
I basically have paid for a piano and a flat-screen television completely with my poker earnings. I'm pretty good at it.
I haven't done 'Celebrity Poker Showdown,' and I would love them to have me, but I think I'm not a big enough celebrity yet to get on there.
I remember when 'Deadwood' had first come out, there was this whole deer-in-the-headlights sense of feeling really uncomfortable with being recognized in public.
The Deadwood dirt they painted on us with powder. The air always smelled of livestock and something burning, gave a sooty, dense feel to the air. It was a mixture of odors.
We romanticize the past with an illusion that we'd know how we'd fit.
'Deadwood' was an incredible experience.
