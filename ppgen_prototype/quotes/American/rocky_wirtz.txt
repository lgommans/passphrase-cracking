I look like Scooby-Doo in a beard.
We know we can't win the Cup every year. But we certainly can be in position to win the Cup every year, and if we've done that, I think we've earned our paycheck.
In business, no one pays you to have a really good year and then 10 bad years.
The last thing you want to see is your great players in the press box or in the locker room.
We have multiple businesses, and obviously we want every one to stand on its own, and what you don't want to do is manage one business from the profit of the other one.
You can technically lose money during the playoffs if you don't raise your ticket prices.
Embrace your fans and really work with them.
I understand that fans think short-term, and there's nothing wrong with that. You live or you die in the short term. But I believe in our system, and when you do that, you don't make knee-jerk decisions.
You have to have coaches willing to adapt.
Throughout her life, my grandmother was a champion for the arts and giving back.
I love my father. I disagreed with him. But he was my father. He was the boss.
Having the games on TV, I've always believed it's like watching a soap opera - fans can't wait for the next episode.
My idea is bring in good people and then get out of their way.
Owners are made to be hated. We're the guys that trade away your favorite player.
We don't own the team; we just rent it. The fans own it, and a lot of times, they haven't been happy with the renter.
The last thing that should come between two willing parties, one that wants to adopt and one that wants to find a home, is economics.
I think that with the success of the team, more people realize that Blackhawks charities exist.
I'd rather write a check than make myself look ridiculous.
Winning is good for your bottom line.
