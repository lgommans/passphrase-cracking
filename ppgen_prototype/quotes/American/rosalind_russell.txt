American,Actress
Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death.
Taking joy in living is a woman's best cosmetic.
Acting is standing up naked and turning around very slowly.
A man is insensible to the relish of prosperity until he has tasted adversity.
Success is a public affair. Failure is a private funeral.
Flops are a part of life's menu and I've never been a girl to miss out on any of the courses.
I'll match my flops with anybody's but I wouldn't have missed 'em.
Where is there beauty when you see deprivation and starvation?
It's fine to have talent, but talent is the last of it. In an acting career, as in an acting performance, you've got to have vitality. The secret of successful acting is identical with a woman's beauty secret: joy in living.
