American,Politician
I will continue my consistent record of voting for lower taxes, less spending and fewer regulations to make our government more effective and efficient while upholding our Constitution.
I will work for energy policies that recognize oil won't last forever.
We need to have a culture that says 'the less energy you can use to be comfortable, the better off you are and the better you should feel about yourself'.
