Going home and just seeing what a mess youth baseball was was an eye-opener. I just want to make it a better game.
I enjoy talking pitching and talking baseball. And I don't have all the answers. I don't claim to, but I'm more than happy to share my beliefs.
Anytime you do something different, a lot of attention gets put on it.
I've always tried to work hard. I'm not trying to show anybody up or do something spectacular for attention.
