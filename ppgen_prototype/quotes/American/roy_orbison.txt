I close my eyes, then I drift away, into the magic night I softly say. A silent prayer, like dreamers do, then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you.
Only the lonely know the way I feel tonight.
I may be a living legend, but that sure don't help when I've got to change a flat tire.
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, you're not the truth. No one could look as good as you, mercy.
Love hurts, love scars, love wounds, and mars.
As you stopped to say hello, oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell that I'd been crying over you.
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot, love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot.
You wiggle to the left, you wiggle to the right, you do the Ooby Dooby with all your might.
I got a woman that's mean as she can be, sometimes I think she's almost as mean as me.
