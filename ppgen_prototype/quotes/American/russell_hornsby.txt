I mean, of course, I love sci-fi and stuff like that, but I'm not, like, a comic book crazy guy.
In a lot of work places, you work at a lot of jobs and people work more with their colleagues than with their family.
As an actor, we spend so much putting the mask on and trying to be someone you're not.
At the end of the day, you have to find the humanity in you in each character.
The thing is, about a character, it's not about being right, it's about the truth. The truth comes from within, so you have to search as an artist for the truth.
