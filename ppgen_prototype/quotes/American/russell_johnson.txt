American,Actor
We had a good cast and we loved each other.
Really, we don't know what to make of it except that we're delighted about it. We have all these fans thirty years later and they're still around and will probably be around for a long time to come.
It's a phenomenon that we don't really understand.
I must give an account for what I've done.
If any man be in Christ, he's a new preacher. The old things are passed away and all things become new.
Old actors never die, they don't even fade away. They're always available.
I was always the bad guy in westerns. I played more bad guys than you can shake a stick at until I played the Professor. Then I couldn't get a job being a bad guy.
I have great trouble with the people who envision AIDS as a punishment from God.
