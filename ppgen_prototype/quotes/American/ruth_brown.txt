A fox is a wolf who sends flowers.
If you are speaking about my own songs, I would think so because we were talking about that particular era and I was singing one of my songs that I recorded 50 years ago.
Unfortunately, the young generation, who I believe have their own place in the sun like I had mine; but I wish it was possible there were other ways to have them understand this music was here before they came, and the reason that it was here.
When I saw all of the people I have known all these years, when we got together, it was scary because B.B King and I lived in the same place in Nevada.
We are trying to prove that the blues lives on forever and anybody in this place can sing the blues.
There was a time we decided that it was songs that were done especially from my background because of the things we were dealing with, but nowadays, anybody who has a need, and can find the need, they can sing the blues.
There are stories that people don't want to talk about that brought this music through.
But of course it's different now, the blues is no longer blues, it's green now.
I sang on Church Street, every place that had a stage.
When I got through, Duke Ellington stood up and started the applause.
I was trying to do Billie Holiday, because she was the voice to be heard at that time.
I thought the best thing you were supposed to do was find somebody and try to sound like them.
