I think in the NFL, continuity is something that is helpful, but it's not the end all. In a league where injuries are so prevalent, you're used to guys moving in and out.
If Hollywood was somewhere else, if Hollywood was in Lincoln, Nebraska, then obviously celebrities would be coming around a lot more to the Huskers games.
Some guys milk injuries and miss a couple games at the beginning. Other guys, they tough it out for the betterment of the team.
I'm in the NFL now, and it's nothing like what we did at USC. Not at all. The only difference between my college and other colleges is the games we won and the attention we got because of it. Obviously being in Los Angeles plays a huge role in the publicity. We don't have a football team in L.A., so we kind of are like the pro team.
