American,Actor
I graduated from public high school. I went to the prom. I did it all. But I also worked on 30-million dollar movies with roller coasters and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's been a very interesting and blessed life for sure.
It's nice to have a little bit of action in your world. Sometimes us actors go a couple months without working, it gets a little crazy. It's good to be busy.
Oklahoma's my home. I love it there. I miss it.
I'm definitely a boot-scootin' kind of guy.
I come from a good family. I come from a faith-based family.
I played football growing up in junior high and high school.
It's all about doing work, being creative and staying true to who you are and having fun. That's what us actors are all about.
