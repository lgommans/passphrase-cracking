I hope that one of my legacies, and I worked to pass it on, is moderation in politics.
I believe in operating in the big middle of the electorate and not being to the far right or the far left. I think you get so much more done.
There are people who think I should be using the position of secretary of state simply to weigh the scales on the side of my own party. I just don't accept that, and it would not be proper.
