American,Musician
If you have music that sounds like what you cover, people won't be able to differentiate who you are.
My writing voice is a little quirkier, more singer-songwriter-y than the Top 40 stuff I cover.
Up until I started on YouTube, my first love was musical theater.
There are certainly things labels can still provide that indie artists can't. They can pave the way to radio and pay big bucks for promotion.
I was going to go to college and graduate and move to New York and do the Broadway thing. That's where a lot of my influences vocally and writing come from. Then I did some covers, and towards the end of college, I saw it was a path I could take. I wrote more pop music.
