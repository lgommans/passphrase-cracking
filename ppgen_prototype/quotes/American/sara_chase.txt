I sing 'I Have Confidence' from 'The Sound of Music' as Judy Garland, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Elaine Stritch and Julie Andrews - each alternating lines.
My dad and I watched 'Amadeus' when I was 6, and I knew I wasn't going to be an engineer.
Paul Daigneault of The SpeakEasy Stage Company in Boston gave me my Equity card playing Marta in 'Company' right before I graduated Boston University. He knew my next stop was New York. I cannot say enough good things about the SpeakEasy Stage Company.
This is very unprofessional, but at 'The Toxic Avenger,' Demond Green, Matt Saldivar and I had a contest to see who could say the word 'ochre' the most times during the show. Well, I had a song called 'Choose Me Oprah,' so I just said ochre instead of Oprah the whole time.
