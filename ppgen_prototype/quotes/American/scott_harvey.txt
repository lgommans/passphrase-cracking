Amateur golf is so much fun.
I've seen some good friends playing mini-tour golf, and they just don't seem as happy as I am playing the game.
If you could just turn pro and go immediately to the PGA Tour, that would be one thing. But that's not how it works. And that's not the lifestyle I want.
I got off the school bus every day at the driving range. I'd hit balls and goof around all day out there. I picked up balls by hand every night. That was my job.
My dad taught me everything. It's been fun walking in his footsteps. He played for his whole life and traveled the country and had a great career. He taught me everything about life and playing golf and how to act. Just everything. I learned so much from him and those days hanging around the driving range.
I like to go out on the golf course and talk, cut up, and tell jokes.
Fortunately, I can play a lot of golf with my job.
Mistakes will turn into bogeys real quick.
In match play, you don't ever want to play anybody that you know just because you don't want to send them home, but you don't want to go home yourself, either.
