We continue to elect the very same people, and we wonder why we get the same results.
I think a sitting senator who's been there 36 years is not doing a favor to anyone in the state of Utah nor to the country.
He's 78 years old... He's not the same Orrin Hatch I knew 12 years ago.
At IBM, if we kept our same leadership for 36 years, we'd be bankrupt.
Let's get the elephant out of the room. I'm a conservative Democrat.
Sometimes I wonder if I'm running against Mitt Romney or Sen. Hatch.
We can have open and good discussion with our Republican brothers and sisters. But when we walk into the chapel we should leave our political differences out in the parking lot.
Look, Orrin Hatch is not a bad guy. But he is an old guy, and he's a lifer politician.
Orrin Hatch is old enough to be my father, and I don't want my father running the United States Senate Finance Committee.
You cannot be a part-time candidate when you're running against Orrin Hatch.
Education is not Democrat versus Republican. It's about doing the right things for the right reason for our kids.
I strongly support extending current student loan interest rates and increasing the college tuition tax credit for students and their families.
The chalkboards are no longer cutting it. We've got to adapt education at every level to this new paradigm to keep our kids competitive. Affordability of technology has to be at the forefront of everything we do.
We need fresh, new leadership with bold ideas and a new approach to get more people back to work with quality jobs and restored dignity in the lives of our Utahns.
My experience is not creating debt but my experience is creating jobs.
