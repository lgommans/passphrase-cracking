Just to get the basic fundamentals and empathy - I think that's the most important thing to bring to it if you've acted in the past and are now a director: the empathy.
I get very picky. There's sort of a line you have to walk between working and doing something you actually want to be a part of, as opposed to just working for the work. That often puts you in a place where you have to choose whether or not you want to wait for good material to come along.
I'm always under the impression that directors should act at some point or another.
It can be a detriment to yourself to not be working, but at the same time, you want to hold true to what you're wanting to be working on.
