A healthy ocean is vital to our economy and well-being. We need clean and healthy oceans to sustain tourism and fisheries.
Earth Day should encourage us to reflect on what we are doing to make our planet a more sustainable and livable place.
I don't think we should view corporations as people for the purposes of speech.
Corporations are a fictional entity that are designed to make money, and they're neither people nor patriots.
The unending chase for money, I believe, threatens to steal our democracy itself. I've used the word 'corrupting,' and I want to be very clear about it: I mean by it not the corruption of individuals, but a corruption of a system itself that all of us are forced to participate in against our will.
I'm just not a purist. You set goals and you have to work with everyone to figure out how to get what you can.
The San Diego region in many ways is defined by our relationship with the ocean. It's our front yard and a beautiful playground for families and visitors. It should be clean, safe, and inviting.
In Congress, I am focused on the effects of climate change, including ocean acidification and sea-level rise - both of which are threats to healthy oceans that sustain life on- and off-shore.
Comprehensive immigration reform would reduce the deficit and help grow the economy.
In San Diego, our local innovation economy is a thriving industry employing thousands of highly skilled workers.
Supporting the entrepreneurial spirit is our best chance for economic progress.
If we are to maintain our position as a global economic leader, we've got to end the govern-by-crisis mentality that sets us back instead of moving us forward.
