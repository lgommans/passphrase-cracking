I hope people remember me for the kind of person that I am, not because of what I do.
Anybody can be fit. But you have to be patient. Give your body some time to adjust.
I've dealt with many challenges in my life, with my family.
Working with Michael Chiklis is a lesson in professionalism and staying focused. That's what Chiklis brings all day long.
I hate the polo collar.
I hate junk food. It depresses me.
I don't want a girl who's high-maintenance and wants to go shopping... I like a girl who doesn't wear make-up and is naturally beautiful.
I see so many people in the gym just slinging weight around. You can accomplish more if you squeeze the reps out in perfect form, instead of going big and trying to kill it every time.
