American,Actor
I was pre-med, so I was going to go into the family business, more or less. But I came to my senses, luckily, and backed out, and decided to go to drama school.
You spend most of your time as an actor unemployed, so you're not going to hear me complaining that I haven't had a day off in three weeks.
I've never seen the first three 'Star Wars' movies. It's just not really my genre.
Since 'Heroes' started, I've probably had about 15 or 16 film scripts sent to me with Indian characters, and out of those, maybe one was good.
'Heroes' was a huge show with 12 cast members and giant special effects.
My mother is teaching me Indian recipes. I'll go to the market, get everything fresh, have a glass of red wine, and just do it. I find it really therapeutic.
As the actor, you can't go in saying, 'I'm the bad guy.' You've got to think your reasons for doing what you're doing are good.
I've never really been a big sci-fi guy or a big comic book guy.
