I wouldn't exactly describe 'Detention' as a horror movie. I mean, it does have horror elements in it, but it's got a lot more to it, and it's not a typical horror movie.
Sometimes you go into an audition and you'll do what you think the character is, and then if they agree, then it's awesome and you'll book it maybe, and you'll live happily ever after. But sometimes they don't agree.
I try not to think about any of the production side of things. If you do, you tend to get unfocused and distracted. I just try to think about the character and the scene and what I'm doing.
I had a weird high school because I graduated early when I was 16. I moved out to California, but I was only there for freshman and sophomore year, and I was a bit of a brainiac.
When I was a freshman, I didn't have that much time for extra-curriculars, so I didn't do any theater stuff. Actually, I didn't do it with my school. I did theater with this thing called Teen Source.
I like the paranormal side a lot; that's my favorite kind of horror movie because it plays on your fear of the dark and makes you go home, and you can't sleep at night.
