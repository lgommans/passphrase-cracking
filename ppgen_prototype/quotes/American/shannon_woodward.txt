Being a family in general is a comedy of errors.
When you have parents who are a little out of their minds, somebody has to take responsibility.
I worked for a charity for a while, but... well, I started acting while I was in high school. I kind of just got lucky enough to live at my parents' house until I was actually making enough money to be somebody's roommate.
People just usually think I'm someone else. They'll look at me twice, and I'll just say, 'Not Ellen Page.'
