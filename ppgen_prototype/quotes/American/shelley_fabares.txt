We need to appreciate how precious life is.
I had to have a complete liver transplant.
I waited with a beeper for a year and 10 months to get that gift.
I was dying but suddenly had a second chance at living.
They had to match blood type and meet all sorts of things I don't know about.
This is the kind of situation that can tear people apart. It tears at the fabric of your soul and can certainly tear at your marriage and ours has gotten only stronger.

I think the years on 'The Donna Reed Show,' the years from 14 to 19, were so incredibly important. Donna Reed was simply an extraordinary woman, a woman of great strength, kindness, integrity and compassion. I am not trying to make her sound like a saint, but she had the most profound influence on me. I carry her with me today.

One can't change one's life experience, but even if I could, I wouldn't change it because of all the wonderful things that have happened to me.
It's a terrifying thing to be perhaps 16 or 17 and feel like you are a failure and a has-been.
I can't think of my life without Donna Reed. She has been such an enormous influence on my life.
I had to have a complete liver transplant. I waited with a beeper for a year and 10 months to get that gift.
