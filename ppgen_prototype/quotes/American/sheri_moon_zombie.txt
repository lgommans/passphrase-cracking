American,Actress
I did take some voiceover classes. I always loved the idea of doing a voice for a cartoon character. I just voiced the character of Suzi X in the upcoming 'The Haunted World of El Superbeasto.'
I guess you could say the beginning of my career as an actress was when I started performing in music videos.
Nothing can shock me.
Salem is such a cool little town that's very touristy. It's fun to walk around all the shops and get the feeling there.
I really fell in love with the art of making clothes when I was dancing on tour. Creating my stage image through clothes was a blast. I discovered a total sense for what cool chicks and rockin' dudes like to wear. Total Skull is for those people. People that like to rock - total rock.
I actually started making tank tops under the name Kitty Moon many, many years ago, but I just didn't have the time to fully devote to it. Now that we don't go on the road as much, I have a better ability to focus on a line; that's why I started Total Skull.
It's been really gratifying to see that so many people love Total Skull! I really make things that I love, so it's awesome to see other people love it, too.
