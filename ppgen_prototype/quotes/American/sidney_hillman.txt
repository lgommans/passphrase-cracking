Labor also wants shorter hours and a say in how work shall be done.
Politics is the science of who gets what, when, and why.
I even believe in helping an employer function more productively. For then, we will have a claim to higher wages, shorter hours, and greater participation in the benefits of running a smooth industrial machine.
