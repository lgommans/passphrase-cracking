It's like a prize fighter. He knows he has a fight coming up, so he gets in the gym and trains. So when I have a show coming up, I practice yodeling.
I don't think you've ever heard anything bad about me, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'd like the people to remember me as having a good voice and a clean suit.
I have sold 120 million records. Half of those could be in Europe.
Everyone thinks I'm singing falsetto, but that's my normal singing voice.
I can still sing. If you are dead, you can't sing.
The material I did was lasting material. A lot of people thought I wasn't doing anything, but I was in the studio. The biggest factor is the material you choose. You hunt, you cut.
I'd like my son to remember me as a good dad.
