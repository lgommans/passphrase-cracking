To have a sense of education and ethics is important.
I wanted to create a place where parents can come and find products that are safe for their children, as well as good for the planet.
I don't know why you call it morning sickness, because I was sick all day and night!
It's never too early to involve your kids in giving back. And the more hands-on the experiences are, the better.
I think that's one of the most important gifts we have in television - the ability to heal through laughter.
I had such a hard time finding great organic and non-toxic items for my daughter.
Eventually, I'll go back to acting, but for right now, my children are the most important thing in the world to me.
Catsuits were big for me in the '90s, and I had many of them. Even catsuits with shorts in them.
I wanted to be an astronaut and wanted to go to space camp, but then I found out that I was too short to become an astronaut. My mom really made me believe that if I worked hard enough and if I really wanted to do it, I could do it.
I know there are parents who are very structured and organized and are certainly far more together than I am, it's just not me.
We can all become activists and raise questions.
I used to be a free spirit.
I want kids to know that it is okay to make a change in order to feel better about themselves.
My mom always made sure I lived my life as a regular kid.
I love being pregnant!
It's so important and easy to be a kid at heart.
I love social media and the ability to connect to new people through Twitter and Facebook and share my real time experiences with my mommy network.
I was always trying to find the balance between trying my best and being an incredible parent. I literally realized that it was chaos - but it was happy chaos.
I have those moments with my kids and family where we try to unplug and just be in the moment. We put everything else to the side and just be there with our family.
I love, I love human beings, studying them.
