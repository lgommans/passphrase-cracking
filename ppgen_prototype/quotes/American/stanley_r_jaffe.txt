My only real contact with what my father did was that he could get 16-millimeter prints, so every weekend we would show two or three movies at home. But our house wasn't frequented by stars. My father's personal life was his personal life, and it was separate from his professional life.
If somebody's offering you a $400 million company at the age of 29, I've got the ego to say, 'I'd like a shot at that.'
I spend a lot of time with my children. I like to go to the country with them, where we can spend hours walking in the woods and talking. That's more important to me than anything else.
If you bring a child into the world, you have a responsibility to that child in every sense of the word.
I really did grow up in a world where we were taught that crime doesn't pay and we stood up when the teacher came into the room.
The imagination of our children is blunted on television, and their thinking is done for them.
I'm attracted to stories that deal with the family and what it's like to be a member of that family, whether it's together or apart, given the pressures that are put on it by the outside world.
Occasionally, I'll direct if there's something I feel strongly about. Having done it has whetted my appetite to do it again, but I don't feel an internal pressure to direct. It certainly will make me a better producer, because I'm more empathetic; I really appreciate now what the director is going through every day.
