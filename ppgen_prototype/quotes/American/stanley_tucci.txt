American,Actor
I don't like not being busy.
I have consciously not taken the role of a gangster, which has been offered to me far too many times.
I didn't know you had to change diapers so often. I couldn't believe it - we must change them 10 times a day - each. So that's 20 diapers a piece a day.
I was always attracted to the past as a kid.
Like Joseph Mitchell, I would scour the streets of New York and find little pieces of what other people think of as junk - and collect it.
People wear shorts to the Broadway theater. There should be a law against that.
I'd read Up in the Old Hotel, and I wanted to do something with Mitchell's stuff for a long time.
I don't like to move the camera that much anyway.
I mean, Scorsese's a genius, and that's one way of shooting.
Big Night and The Impostors are both things that I wrote.
Even The Impostors, as silly as it is, is a very intimate film, in a way.
I wanted to be an actor when I was a kid.
I was dissatisfied just being an actor.
I'm a control freak. Totally.
I like to use all of myself, and acting wasn't doing that.
The majority of directors I've worked with didn't know how to talk to actors.
I make time to write.
I write in the mornings. During my down time.
But usually I'll wake up and start writing about nine o'clock. I'll probably write for about three hours, and I'll do that over the next month and a half.
You gotta make the movie you want to make.
I would rather just do the things I want to do.
The thing is, I'm a very practical filmmaker.
I never go overbudget on my movies.
I'm not interested in wasting money on a project.
I like to see how I can do it for less money.
And I love doing my own projects; that's what I've always wanted to do.
