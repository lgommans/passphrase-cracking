I love comedy. There's just something so great about making people laugh. And for me, too, whenever I laugh, it just makes me feel so much better just watching a great comedy.
I want to be in a musical. I love music, and just to be able to mash the music and the acting together, it would be just incredible.
I know it sounds cliche, but to give back is important. Sometimes we're given so much, we need to do something for other people. I think that's really important.
When I'm not working, I love going to the beach. I am from Florida, so I definitely love the beach life. I love horse-back riding. Just to go out to a barn, it's fun. It's kind of like a get-away from the city. And also, I love animals.
I love acting. I love singing. Eventually, I'd love to go on Broadway. I love New York so much.
