Whether you're a mother or father, or a husband or a son, or a niece or a nephew or uncle, breast cancer doesn't discriminate.
My father knew my husband long before I ever did. He actually always says that he loved him first... there really was this wonderful respect and admiration between the two of them before I even came into the picture.
I brought my daughters actually to Staples Center to watch me live in the ring - to watch their mother compete in the ring. It was a very proud moment for me.
It's very important that you tell someone when you are being bullied - someone that you trust. You should never be quiet when you are being bullied or when you see someone being bullied. It's so important to stand up and say something.
The strategy is obviously a business decision to have limited advertising on the WWE Network. We want subscribers to know that there won't be commercial breaks during scheduled programming, so your shows won't be interrupted.
'Monday Night Football' is a competitor to 'Monday Night Raw.'
Late at night, I train after I put my kids to bed because putting my kids to bed is very important to me. I have three daughters; they are 8, 6, and soon to be 4. So I train after they go to bed.
My very favorite wrestler of all time was Andre the Giant. He was sort of like my best friend, believe it or not, and I have a picture in 'People' magazine of me sitting on his lap when I was 8 years old after 'WrestleMania I.'
A lot of people know about the power of the WWE brand. We're in 145 countries in 30 different languages. We reach about 650 million households worldwide on a global weekly basis. But what they don't know about WWE is that we use all of that power to give back to the community through events like Hurricane Sandy Relief.
