'CLUE' is a spin on the classic board game. It uses the original characters and weapons, but it goes even further in depth than the classic who-kills-who idea.
I really do not like auditioning... it's hard because you never know what you're going to walk into in a room.
During the screen test for 'Red Widow' was the first time anyone ever told me that I was good at auditioning.
I feel like people who come out to Los Angeles hoping to be an actor give up too easily, and/or they don't put in the amount of time that it really does take.
I'm not a big fan of doing it because I get really frustrated because I can't do any of the tricks, but I love to watch magic.
I competitively ice skate, and I also dance, and I do a lot of theater, which also involves a lot, a lot of physicality, because you have to do a lot of fast changes.
I'm going to have to go with math. Even though that's one of my harder subjects, but it's one of the funnest. Because I also want to be an architect when I grow up, if I can, and I know that being an architect takes a lot of math in it.
