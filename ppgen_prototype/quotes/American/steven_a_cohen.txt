American,Businessman
There's something to be said for giving and helping to change people's lives.
The way I understand the rules on trading on inside information, it's very vague.
I'm not an introvert. I'm media shy.
Tape reading is a lost art that today is not very useful.
I always tell my traders that they would've loved the 1990s because it was a fairly easy time to make money.
I'm married to a very generous woman.
I'm not reclusive. I'm out and about.
