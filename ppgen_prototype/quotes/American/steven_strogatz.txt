One of the pleasures of looking at the world through mathematical eyes is that you can see certain patterns that would otherwise be hidden.
You can get a certain amount of pleasure as a mathematical spectator, reading and watching some of the most beautiful arguments that have been created in the history of humanity. But that's too passive.
When you love a problem, its contours, obstacles and resistances are all just part of its character.
When you create something new, you're breaking tradition - which is an act of defiance.
