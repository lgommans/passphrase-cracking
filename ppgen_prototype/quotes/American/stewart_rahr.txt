I love my wife to death. I mean my ex-wife.
I couldn't buy my way - I had to work my way. What a great quote: 'I couldn't buy my way into success, I had to work my way into success.'
I can't seem to shake waking up early.
I don't mind being a buffoon.
I put the 'fun' in fund-raising and the 'rah' in Israel.
For 42 years, I worked nonstop from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M., day in and day out.
I have no responsibilities but to make people's lives better.
I just have so few sunrises left, and I want to be happy.
I'm blessed to have these billions of dollars.
I just feel that I'm compelled; that I have a responsibility to give back to those less fortunate.
As you know, I'm all about victory for the underdog.
I never wear suits.
I have yellow post-it notes plastered all over my office - they help me stay organized.
I like getting massages regularly. So much so, that I built a massage room adjacent to my office.
In the small remaining journey of life that I have left, I want to choose who I want to be with and to hang around.
I'm just a regular guy.
Every day I am on this Earth, I will do all I can for so many important causes.
What does legacy mean? I never think or go there.
Purple and yellow are my colors.
I can't stand Tiger Woods. He is the most selfish man I've ever played golf with.
Joining forces with Cardinal Health supports Kinray's mission to help retail independent pharmacies serve as an integral provider of care for our evolving health care system.
I have so much. Why did it all happen to me? There has to be a reason.
Happiness just doesn't happen. You have to force yourself.
Whether there is spec buying or not is not the greatest factor in the high cost of pharmaceuticals.
