American,Producer
I'm in prison. But my heart and mind is free. Gangsta haters on the streets are doing more time than me. They need 30 police escorts with them every time they walk down the street.
For thugs from the ghetto, violence is a way of life - it's what helps you survive.
Prison make you a better judge of character. You pick up on people much faster.
You got good and bad people everywhere.
I made up my mind that I wanted everything, and nothing would stop me.
I'm passionate about everything, like my family and friends. Anybody I am talkin' to is gonna be bona fide real. There is no substitution for happiness. Period.
How could you be from the ghetto and be a rat?
The best revenge in the world is success.
As far as anybody in the rap game ever tryin' to assassinate my character, that's impossible. You talkin' about a man who has always walked the walk and talked the talk.
Basically, people are never happy enough because they want more money.
I am in the penitentiary. The only thing that I do is my time.
I can only spend $140 a month in here. I'm saving, like, $10,000 a day.
I don't care about how many times somebody recognizes my face.
I like Biggie. Like 'Pac, he was one of the best rappers in the business. Why would I try to do something to him?
I never seen no shootin'. I only know what I heard and what I read. I had no involvement.
If I stay in here until I am 100 years olds, I will still be a man.
If you always been my enemy, it's still that way.
If you wanna cross somebody, then do that. Don't act like it wasn't you.
In prison, you get the chance to see who really loves you.
My kids get everything they want and are raised well.
No person ever gave me nothing but God.
Of all the artists on Death Row, none of them went bankrupt.
People don't know how hard it is to have your own business.
They been callin up here, asking when I am gonna get out. When I hit bricks, it all belongs to me.
