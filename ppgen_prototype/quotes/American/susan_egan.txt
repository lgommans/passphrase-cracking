You can admire people for sure, and they're worth admiring, but you need to find that special thing about yourself. It takes working hard, getting the technique, and learning to sing and all that stuff, but the master class is about bringing yourself to the role.
My own cabaret is constantly evolving with what is occurring in my own life, so motherhood is a natural addition to it.
Most people don't think of Los Angeles as a theatre town, and that you have to go to New York to be in theatre, and it's really not true.
You never know what your opportunities are going to be.

I grew up listening to Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone, and Angela Lansbury, so I grew up wanting to sound like Patti and Bernadette. What I realized, though, is that I can't sound like that, and what makes their performances magical is their uniqueness.
I think people are surprised to learn that I'm pretty goofy and pretty funny.
I love to put on a wig, a costume, inhabit a different world and be called something different.
