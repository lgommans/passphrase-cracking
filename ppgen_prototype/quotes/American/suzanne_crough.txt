American,Actress
If I want something, I go after it.
My oldest brother was in 'The Andy Griffith Show' as one of Opie's friends.
I came to the age, at 20, that is hard to transfer to an adult. I had a good list of credits, but it's just hard. So I went out for parts when there were some, and I traveled a little, had some fun, and then met my husband.
I'm an office manager for Office Max. I have two daughters. I'm married. I have a normal job.
There is life after acting.
