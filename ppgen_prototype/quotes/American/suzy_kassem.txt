A heart without dreams is like a bird without feathers.
The number of ways you can live in one lifetime is limitless. So why limit yourself? The sky is NOT the limit. Beyond the universe is.
Fear the vulture, and the vulture will come. Fear nothing, and you are the vulture.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
