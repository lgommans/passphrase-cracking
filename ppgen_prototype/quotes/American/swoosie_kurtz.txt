Working with a great director is like getting a master class in acting.
To me, getting notes, honing the part, and refining the role is the real fun of the play.
The first thing I ask when I'm offered a part is, Who's the director? which is something they never understand in Los Angeles.
My heart was beating out of my chest.
It's so funny whenever things come full circle.
It's great that I don't have to apologize about being over 26.
I'd love to do a musical. I have a little list of them in my head.
I think these are terrible times to be anything in.
I love to be directed, and I can glean something from almost anyone.
I keep both of my Tonys on my mantle. They're in front of a mirror so if you look at just the right angle, it looks like I have four!
I am heartbroken that this movie would cause anyone pain. It should be a source of joy. The story is a metaphor about how we try to stay in our own little bubbles, we don't let life in, we don't take the journey.
