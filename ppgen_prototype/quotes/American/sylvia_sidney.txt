Nooooooo... favorite film, that's like asking if you have a favorite kid!
I don't know if there was even a hundred million dollars in the whole country!
Fritz Lang was one of my dearest, dearest friends. I loved working with him.
Tim and Fritz Lang I loved working with. Not Hitchcock so much. There was no communication.
