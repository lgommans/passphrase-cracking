I guess there have been a few questions about my sexuality, and I'd like to quiet any unnecessary rumors that may be out there. While I prefer to keep my personal life private, I hope the fact that I'm gay isn't the most interesting part of me.
In the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work - that's more important than the money.
David Mamet's writing is pretty spectacular, obviously. I like the honesty of it; I like how funny it is and how sad it is.
They call people who love London 'Anglophiles' and people who love France 'Francophiles.' I'd be the New York version of that.
The list of my favorite experiences would almost equal the list of plays I've been in. There are a few exceptions, but out of politeness I'm not going to mention them. If you don't have a few stinkers, you can't appreciate the good ones.
For an actor, a Mamet play is definitely on the list of things you hope to be a part of before it's time to exit.
