American,Actress
I'm much more shy than most of my family.
People always think actors are really 'out there,' so you wouldn't have me pegged as one, but I knew pretty early on it was what I wanted to do, and I think that's pretty lucky.
I had the benefit of watching good people show me what it really is to be an actor - the day in and day out of it.
I didn't have a sense of being in a show business family or of being different, partly because Los Angeles is an industry town, so you don't think about it as being special.
I used to wonder because I never thought I looked like either of my parents, but now I think I look like a conglomeration.
I really like being married. I love my husband.
I would say divorce, breaking up, being a child of divorce, any of those things are always very challenging.
