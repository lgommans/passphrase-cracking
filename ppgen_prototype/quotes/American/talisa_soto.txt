As an actor, you look for roles that can constantly challenge you and you can learn from.
Being part of the fashion world, I'm definitely not a fashion victim. If the style that's going on at that moment suits me, I might integrate it slightly into my look. I'm someone with my own unique style.
Dresses are beautiful, but I'm such a slacks or a jeans person. Whenever a woman has a slick suit or dress on, she looks sharp.
I eat healthy and don't even get on a scale. I have my favorite jeans that I wear, and if they are getting too snug, I watch what I eat for a week.
