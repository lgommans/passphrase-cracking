I like dirty boys. Mechanics, construction workers, artists who get paint and clay everywhere. They gotta have rough hands.
I really like structured coats and layered scarves, and I especially love cashmere sweaters.
I would like to see 'A Confederacy of Dunces' by John Kennedy Toole adapted.
I would love to go help baby sea turtles back into the ocean after hatching in Mexico.
Moviewise, I would love to make the story of princess Erendira. She was a 16 year old princess/warrior who led her tribe in war against the Spanish around 1513. She almost defeated them, and the Tarascans were the only tribe the Aztecs couldn't defeat.
I don't feel famous.
