Finding out I was pregnant was one of the most joyous moments in my life. I will never forget it.
A lot of the time when people get married in the infatuation, it will go down. That is inevitable. The infatuation stage will not last forever.
You look in my room and it looks neat enough, but if you dared to look under my bed or in my closet, oh what a mess!
I'm totally fine with people criticizing me in shows... people like this show, or don't; you're entitled to your opinion. But when people are criticizing you as a person, I have to say it's a little bit different.
I love to travel the world. My husband and I always travel and everywhere we go I've been to Italy, of course London, Ireland, and you just receive so much love.
I'd rather marry my husband in the stage where I know what I'm getting into and what it's going to be like for our life together.
