The situation at Buffalo was a rough situation, and I appreciate the opportunity, but going back to Seattle was a better situation, even though I'm not the starter. I've got a chance to get back with some familiar faces, back at a place I'm familiar with.
I'm just here to compete and do the best I can and let things play out and just be the best teammate I can be, regardless of the situation.
I'm to a point now where you want to play for your fans and all that, but I'm playing for the guys in that huddle. I'm playing for the guys in that locker room.
If they keep booing, and we keep winning, I don't care.
I don't remember anything from the Bills. It was rough there, but it is what it is. Now I'm here in the Super Bowl, just trying to enjoy that.
I don't care if it's a preseason game or not. You want to win.
