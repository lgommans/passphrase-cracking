I'm not going to get into the writer's skills or what he was trying to portray because that's not fair. I can only say what I felt was trying to be portrayed there.
I'm sure I'm perceived in a more glam way. This is my breakout if you will.
Creating a character and living truthfully through her is a whole different ball game. It's all part of the same person but it's a much newer medium for me.
I love drag queens... they perform me better than I ever could myself.
I think I was perceived in one fashion. A video is based on a song. I think you can get glimpses of people's presence within that. There's some people you enjoy watching more than others.
Singing and being truthful to a song... I've developed that skill, and I know how to do that real instinctively, that's all I've been doing for the last 25 years.
The men were all scumbags, but the whole point of the film is to show the development of that. Each guy is going in there to have a good time. By and large, these men are career men, family men, and you just see the deterioration of them.
