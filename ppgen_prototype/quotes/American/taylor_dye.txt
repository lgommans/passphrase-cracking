Country music is all about telling stories, and we're just telling a little different one.
Writing makes you feel better, to get it all out.
At the end of the day, we're just trying to be honest and, hopefully, get more females on the radio.
Fans who drive insane amount of hours to come to a show still amazes me. I mean, it can get up to 10 hours! That's loyalty.
It is something where I think that people need to take a step back and realize how bad these things we are doing really are for our ears. But nobody really thinks about it. We're playing shows every night with music in our ears. That's just the industry.
I just feel like giving people a voice to something.
I think I've gotten more confident because the more you do it and the more shows you play, you just feel more confident. You feel more confident about everything.
I'm not really the type of person who wears my heart on my sleeve. I keep everything inside.
