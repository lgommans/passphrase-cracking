You have to like the characters you play.
I love my wife, I love my kids.
I don't know why, but I'm an easy target. And I don't do anything to dispel it.
I guess I just wasn't meant to dance.
I remember in high school trying to get home from water-polo practice in time so I could see Happy Days on television when it first came on, because I was so blown away by it. It was just such a cool thing.
I've always said that the word 'genius,' especially in Hollywood, is way overused.
Most of my stuff, I never really watch.
Hollywood's all about, 'Let's make this easy: This is what you do, so you go over here in this group, and we're not gonna call you.'
