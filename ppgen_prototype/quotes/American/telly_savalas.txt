We're all born bald, baby.
I was born with a romantic nature, and I'll carry it to my grave.
I'm a proud Greek. I carry my Hellenism like a badge of merit.
I'm a romantic realist. I knew I would become a star, just as I know some day the bubble will burst.
I came from a tough neighborhood. I used to be a 'dirty Greek.'
