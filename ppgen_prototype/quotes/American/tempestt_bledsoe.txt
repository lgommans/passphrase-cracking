I have personal issues with clutter. I, personally, am very minimalist and like a clean slate. I like to throw everything away.
Whenever someone says, 'You've changed my life,' you can't replace that.
For me, what works best is to try to eat healthy and not worry about the scale.
You can no longer define your manhood by whether you're on a nine-to-five job or you're making more money than your wife.
'Cosby' opened up so many people's vision to something that they had never seen before or really contemplated before and exposed them to things that were going on that were completely below their radar.
'The Cosby Show' changed America's opinion on so many different topics and opened so many people's eyes, and so you really learned immediately the power of what you were doing, that there was a power in portraying a role, and you were made aware of the effect that it could have on people, so it does raise the bar.
There is no substitute for taking off in flight in front of a live audience.
I love helping people put their homes in order.
This is a tough business for anyone, especially if you start out young. I feel really lucky about the way things have turned out.
I like transformative TV.
