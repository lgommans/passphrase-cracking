American,Actor
My mom was an actress, so I got with her boutique agency back in 2001 and started booking a few commercials. She's like my co-manager.
I thought I was going to the NBA, but God knows, I'm not tall enough. I don't know what I was thinking.
Going through different places, I stopped through Dubai and stayed there overnight. There I had an ultra-culture shock.
I started home school around sixth grade, but I'd only done a couple of national commercials. I remember I had this Spalding commercial with Paul Pierce from the Celtics, and I used to go to school, and people made fun of it. It wasn't even cool to be an actor; you got made fun of.
I never got to go to prom. I never went to regular school. I ate lunch by myself.
