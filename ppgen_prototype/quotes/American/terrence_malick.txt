I film quite a bit of footage, then edit. Changes before your eyes, things you can do and things you can't. My attitude is always 'let it keep rolling.'
Nostalgia is a powerful feeling; it can drown out anything.
When people express what is most important to them, it often comes out in cliches. That doesn't make them laughable; it's something tender about them. As though in struggling to reach what's most personal about them they could only come up with what's most public.
I prefer working behind the camera.
There's a good many pictures I'd like to make; we'll see how many I'll be allowed to make.
Martin Sheen was extraordinary. He's a very gifted man.
