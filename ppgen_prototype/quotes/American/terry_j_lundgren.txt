I thought I was going to be a veterinarian. I was good in science and in math, and I loved animals.
Every month I do a webcast for 55,000 people, and it's a great tool, great communication vehicle.
My father worked two jobs. He assembled speakers during the day, and then he sold real estate at night and on weekends. And then he eventually, when he was in his mid-50s, became a full-time real estate salesman.
I'm on the road two or three days a week normally.
I read so much data. There's so much information that comes my way. And there's got to be a way for me to delegate more.
My father was clearly a mentor. He told me if you work 10 years and you worked 40 hours a week, then you had 10 years experience. But if you worked 10 years and you worked 60 hours a week, then you had 15 years' experience.
When I was a sophomore in college, my father called me at the fraternity. He told me he no longer had the funds to pay for college. If I wanted to continue, I would have to do it on my own.
I discovered that the best thing for me was to be very busy all the time. I can get a lot done, and I can do those tasks well.
I had 13 job offers out of college. I went to Bullock's department store and had a fantastic interview, but was skeptical. I knew retail didn't pay much.
I was the only kid out of six of us to go to college, primarily because my parents could not afford it.
