I've been fortunate because I got the gift to do comedy and drama. When you can do both, you get twice as many parts as anyone else.
It's interesting to me; you do four, five or six of these Comic Cons or things like that across the country a year. Obviously, I get busted a lot of 'Weekend at Bernies,' but the fans for horror movies are so wonderful and so loyal.
If you play dead often enough, you've got a great will to live.
You don't have to look like George Clooney. You just have to know yourself.
