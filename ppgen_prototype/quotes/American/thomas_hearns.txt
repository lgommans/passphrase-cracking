American,Athlete
I prayed, thanking God, for making it all possible for me, because I knew where I came from.
I'm going to fight again because this wasn't a fight.
In boxing, everybody has their favorites.
Ray Leonard was more of a favorite than Thomas Hearns that night.
That was the fight. I knew that I had done something that no man had been able to do to a champion.
The loss just made me hungry; it made me want to go out and win another title.
Some people are going to be happy with my decision, some people aren't... But I must live my life.
