American,Actor
I'm looked upon as a theater actor who happened to know martial arts before I got into the movies.
Kids are always infatuated with the action in martial arts films. Let me tell you, there is nothing better for kids than the arts. That is what kept me straight and decent. I always had a place to go. That was the dojo. I always had something to look forward to doing.
I think audiences like to see their favorite actor handle himself physically on screen, however he does it. He can wrestle, or box, or he can know karate.
I enjoy doing martial arts films, but I like the straight stuff, too. I'd like to go back and do some Shakespeare, and maybe knock out a play or two. It's all about keeping balance.
