American,Artist
Everyone can identify with a fragrant garden, with beauty of sunset, with the quiet of nature, with a warm and cozy cottage.
I view art as an inspirational tool.
When I got saved, God became my art agent.
I'm a warrior for light.
With whatever talent and resources I have, I'm trying to bring light to penetrate the darkness many people feel.
People who put my paintings on their walls are putting their values on their walls: faith, family, home, a simpler way of living, the beauty of nature, quiet, tranquillity, peace, joy, hope. They beckon you into this world that provides an alternative to your nightly news broadcast.
People are reminded that it's not all ugliness in the world.
I share something in common with Norman Rockwell and, for that matter, with Walt Disney, in that I really like to make people happy.
I remember my mom had a big collection of copies of Saturday Evening Post magazines, and that was really my introduction to those great illustrators.
I was always the kid who could draw. I had this talent, and it was the one thing that gave me some kind of dignity in the midst of my personal environment.
