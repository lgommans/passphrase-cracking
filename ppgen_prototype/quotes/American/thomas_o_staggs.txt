Disney truly stands alone, not only because of the company's phenomenal creativity, but also because of the thousands of remarkable people who make it such an extraordinary place.
If we can enhance the experience, more people will spend more of their leisure time with us.
Giving our guests faster and better access to the fun is at the heart of our investment in technology.
The Internet represented a really important tool that would be used by every business out there to some extent. But for the vast majority of companies to say, 'We're an Internet company,' is a little bit like saying, 'We're a fax company because we have a fax machine.'
The Internet is an interesting tool to use to reach people with things that you might call 'Disney learning,'
What we are doing is increasing our focus on cash flow, return on investment, and value creation.
One thing that I would like the market to appreciate more is the difference between Disney and other media companies.
