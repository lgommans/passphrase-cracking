Quality, affordable housing is a key element of a strong and secure Iowa.
Now our job, our duty, our responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our citizens cannot be complete unless we guarantee health care security for our citizens.
The future of healthcare security should include flexibility from the federal government to allow us to serve the state's most vulnerable citizens.
My friends, history, history calls us to this time and to this place. A solemn choice rests with us - where do we go from here? Do we move slowly and incrementally? Or do we seize the challenge of our time and tackle the great issues of our day.
Let us tackle the big issues with bold ideas that transform Iowa to accomplish our shared mission to grow Iowa, and realize our shared vision of Iowa as the best place to live, work and raise a family.
We have a long tradition in this state of caring for our neighbors - it is truly an Iowa value.
