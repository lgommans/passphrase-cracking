American,Writer
Without so much as turning a hair I freely admit that I am one of America's greatest realists.
Like life itself my stories have no point and get absolutely nowhere.
Quite casually I wander into my plot, poke around with my characters for a while, then amble off, leaving no moral proved and no reader improved.
