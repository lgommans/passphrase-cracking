Among the many things 'Boardwalk Empire' is, is a gangster show.
Anyone who's stood on the floor of a set knows nothing gets done by itself.
I'm still nervous before I start any episode. I never feel completely secure, and I love that.
When you start out, you're hungry to take any job. I didn't go to film school - I went from high school to a show about high school and on to directing.
As you move along, it's about choices. Once you've gathered enough credits, you have to be more specific. You have to know what level of show you want to work on and be willing to turn down a lot of work to have the career you want.
I feel it's God's work to convey a message.
Life means a lot to me.
I lost my mom to cancer when I was a kid.
It's a little hard to believe 40-year-old men as high school students.
You know people love a show when they keep coming back.
