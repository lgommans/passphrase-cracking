Reading is what people did before YouTube, and I love retro stuff!
I have a couple of games I've wanted to make in the 'Tobuscus Adventures' universe.
In the beginning, YouTube content wasn't up to the same standard as traditional media. Now, people are using it as a launchpad.
I'm excited to bring my characters to life in book form.
