American,Actor
I like acting, alright, and it can be fun sometimes, but the process of it, of not being - not being the author of your own life, I can't take that anymore.
I actually grew up hearing this a lot: 'If you're an actor, you can only be an actor, and you have to just do that.' But in order to be a good actor, you have to draw on life experiences. To only concentrate on acting, you're cutting yourself off.
I've had so many jobs other than acting, it's insane.
