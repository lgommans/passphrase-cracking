I'm not Waylon Jennings, but I do a fair imitation of him, and a few other country greats, like Willie Nelson. It would be great to sink my teeth into a project where I could play a country singer. I'm like an old cowboy.
Will Smith is the biggest movie star I've ever met, and he couldn't be more gracious.
I got my equity card, found my agent, and then I got a part on 'Gilmore Girls.' That turned into a job that kept giving - they wrote more for me.
I'll only work on TV shows that have a 'Sookie' on them! Those are the only shows that will cast me. And I've never even met a Sookie in my life. Sookie on 'Gilmore Girls' was played by Melissa McCarthy. And Sookie, played by Anna Paquin, is number one on the call sheet on 'True Blood.' Somebody should write another script with a Sookie in it.
If I could ask for any life, I'd like to be the lead singer and guitarist for Willie Nelson & Family. That is to say, Willie.
I'm more of an actor than a musician. I've made a little name for myself as an actor, but I also front this band. We have some great players out here, and we've found a little niche with L.A. Hootenanny.
I liked baseball and sports and Garbage Pail Kids and comic books. I know what it's like to really adore something.
Vampires are pretty frightening. Knowing they can 'glamor' you is pretty weird. And you shake hands or hug them and they're cold. I wouldn't like that.
