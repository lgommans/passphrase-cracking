American,Politician
I think that person who actually proposes things, who will save Medicare, will be in a lot stronger position than someone who demagogues the issue.
My first district was Northwest Iowa. In 2002, it became North Central Iowa hooking around Des Moines down to the south, clear up to the northeast corner of the state.
Generally, Iowans are Iowans no matter where you go. There are some different issues in Des Moines than in the real rural areas. But I haven't seen any real difference outside of just local issues.
I listen. I meet with everybody, I don't care what their political persuasion is - whether it be a labor union or small-business folks or individuals who have problems. But I meet with everybody and listen.
It is never a perfect time or a right time to step aside. But for me, this is the time. I want to share with you my decision that I will not be a candidate for any office in November of 2014.
