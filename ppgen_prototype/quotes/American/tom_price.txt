American,Politician
One person's embarrassment is another person's accountability.
I have no feelings for the criminal. All my feelings lie with the victim.
The American people need to know that there are folks here fighting as hard as they can for individual liberty, economic freedom, appropriate national security and the fundamental moral values that have made our nation the greatest nation in the history of mankind.
Anybody that's asked, I've counseled that they not expand Medicaid eligibility. I've been critical of any expansion because you know what Washington does. It promises something for a finite period of time, and then it leaves you on the hook.
Society is now less convinced of the absolute accuracy of the criminal justice system.
I am convinced that, because the criminal justice system is run by humans, it is naturally subject to human error. There is no rational basis to believe that this same type of human error will not infect capital murder trials.
I liked the give-and-take of a policy discussion in the community, with citizens. I didn't know that even took place, frankly, but I never dreamed it would be an enjoyable thing to do.
Evolving societal values indicate that the death penalty should be abolished in its entirety.
'Competent counsel' ought to require more than a human being with a law license and a pulse.
I'm very tough on crimes where there are victims who have been physically harmed. In such cases, I do not believe in leniency.
