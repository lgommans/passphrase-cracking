As a very experienced writer once told me, 'It's in the rewrites'.
I'm currently trying to direct my own material.
Just being hired by a great director is complimentary.
Most screenplays depend primarily on the vision of a director.
Obviously, if a director doesn't communicative a clear, relevant vision of the material, it will not succeed no matter how good the material.
One has the responsibility to oneself, to the writer, director and the people who put up the money, to put out the best of what one has experienced and understood about the human condition as it relates to the role one has been hired to portray.
Rarely ever see or meet the writer during shooting.
TV writing is different than other mediums, involving the writer.
