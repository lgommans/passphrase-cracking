American,Author
I've been in a lot of castles, and they are pretty damp, cold and gloomy. However, I love Windsor Castle in England.
Every part of the country has its story to tell, so I'm always looking for the next place to be.
I enjoy the research and love actually creating the words. There's not too much I find a drudge when it comes to writing.
My writing process is such that a story will be in my head for awhile, and I'll start making notes on my computer. I create character sheets that include a character's past, fears, goals and ambitions.
Sometimes, my books start with a scene I see in my mind, such as a woman in a wedding dress running away from her wedding like in 'Embers of Love.' Sometimes, a book can start with a character.
I used to think I'd like to have been a pioneer on the Oregon Trail, experience untamed America.
I've actually traveled quite a bit with various authors. Judith Miller and I toured the highlands in Scotland with Liz Curtis Higgs, and that was incredible fun. However, I love going with my husband, who - although he is not a writer per se, he is a historian and can give me a lot of insight on various historical locations.
I realized little by little that words are very powerful, and taking those words to encourage people rather than tear them apart was the desire of my heart.
Authors can get an attitude of us-against-them when it comes to publishers, but learning how authors and editors can work together taught me to look at my work in a different way and to make that work as solid as possible before it ever goes to the publisher.
When I was as little as four years old, my mom would give me a pen and paper and tell me to write a story to keep me busy.
