American,Musician
It's the same old story you've heard a thousand times. Somebody's trust gets broken. Somebody's left behind.
If you're gonna sing, sing loud.
People look at you, and they've got just the perfect little box for you, the perfect category. Call you a redneck. Call you a hillbilly. Like those were insults.
Bluegrass is really a big part of my background.
When they talk about music getting in your blood, I understand exactly what they're talking about, because that is me.
I know what it takes to put a record together, so I'm not looking for people to come in and shape it.
I've been very fortunate to have had the opportunities to have the career I've had.
I've been writing on my own. It's like Roger Miller used to say, every now and then, like a dog having puppies, you have to crawl under the house and do it yourself.
