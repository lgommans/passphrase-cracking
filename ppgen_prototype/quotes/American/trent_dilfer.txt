Hit the ball pretty solid. Haven't played a lot of golf this year, so was really unsure of what it would be like. I've been playing pretty well lately, especially hitting the ball solid.
Went to 16 and hit a really bad 3 wood for my second shot and got stuck in the bunker about 70 yards from the pin. Poor execution, chunked it, hit a good chip up to about eight feet, missed it.
So I went way too in depth? I thought they wanted the hole by hole.
I was in the back part of the bunker, so I had to carry the whole bunker. It was probably 20 yards.
I had very low expectations. Honestly, I think I had 11 rounds of golf the entire year in before this tournament, and I had hit balls maybe four or five times.
There's nothing wrong with failing if you learn from it, and I've failed out here plenty.
There are some guys out here that can really play golf, but it has not been their focus for that long.
I used to read every golf magazine front to back; I was addicted to Golf Channel, read Rotella, read every golf book.
If you take my entire golfing life, my favorites are the older courses, the more traditional and the more authentic.
I think Tahoe is one of the hidden gems in the country, and I've played a lot of golf around the country. You can't beat the smells and the clean air and just the way it makes you feel.
I sleep 75 percent of all plane trips I take. I love red-eyes from West to East. I take Ambien to make sure I sleep. I always stay on West Coast time, and I'm always so fried when I come back, I usually sleep naturally.
