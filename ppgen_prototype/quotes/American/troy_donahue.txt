American,Actor
I never really got on my own case about my own acting. I know a lot of other people have, and probably very justifiably. But I don't worry about stuff like that too much.
I've never revised my opinion of myself as an actor. I've always thought I was as good as my material.
I would have preferred to have been in a film where I could've been more authentic or more human, where the dialogue and my approach to the part could have been more real.
I write, I teach, I direct. I sail around the world for Holland America two months out of every year doing a seminar where we discuss film or theater and do improvisations.
