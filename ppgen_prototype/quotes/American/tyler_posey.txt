American,Actor
I love doing stunts.
You know I don't care about what I eat. I love food so much, I can't affect the way I eat.
On my mom's side I'm Mexican, and my dad is a white dude.
Acting is all I know; being on a set is all I know.
I took Spanish in high school and I didn't do too well in it. My Spanish teacher told me not to go on with Spanish anymore, so I was discouraged a little bit.
Whenever something good comes up that sounds like I could be part of the project, my manager and my agents send me in on it.
I'm a big fan of zombies, and I have a zombie tattoo on my leg.
I'd love to be a rockstar.
I mean, people don't know what race I am. They never know if I'm Hawaiian or Italian or Mexican or Spanish or white. I could play Jewish, I could play anything.
I grew up with lacrosse in my life because my dad played lacrosse all throughout college, so I grew up with the gear in my house - like the sticks, the helmet.
I was never really unpopular in high school.
I tell a lot of fart and poop jokes. I can't help it. I have no filter, and it just comes out.
