American,Poet
I am unjust, but I can strive for justice. My life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness. I, the unloving, say life should be lovely. I, that am blind, cry out against my blindness.
To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name.
You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
