What is important is to have values in life. What's important is how you are, not how you look.
In some countries, women aren't allowed to wear a swimsuit.
It is more important to know how to mix and match the clothes than to spend money.
I think I lost at least 40% of my fans when I became blond. They didn't recognize me anymore.
I'd never stop traveling, and I love bringing my family along with me. My children have points of reference everywhere, friends from Milan to Los Angeles. I think it's really fun for them.
Dyeing my hair has become a kind of addiction. I can't see myself as anything other than blond. Once you go blond, you stay blond forever.
