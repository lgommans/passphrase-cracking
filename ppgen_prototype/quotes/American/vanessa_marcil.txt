What makes a woman beautiful is her loyalty to and her friendships with other women, and her honesty with men.
I'm not ready to be a woman yet, I'd like it if my body were more boyish. Maybe I'll like my curves when I'm older but right now they kind of make me squirm.
Because of my crazy work schedule, I have become something of a master at changing my clothes while driving. The men driving next to me love it.
If I deny myself something, I just get resentful, so what's the point?
I eat whatever I want, junk food included.
Acting probably saved my life. It gave me a home and a safe place to let out all of my emotions and have it be okay.
I don't know any woman who doesn't have an anxiety attack about wearing a bathing suit.
My family didn't have any money growing up. I'm just a girl from the ghetto; from Indio, California.
I don't get this whole super-skinny obsession. I really think women look more beautiful when they let their curves show.
I love Vegas. It's like going to Disneyland.
