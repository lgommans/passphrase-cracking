I think there should be a good balance between being a good student and being able to enjoy your high school life.
Well, the thing about my high school, which I loved, is that we had uniforms. But whenever we had a free dress day, it was prep-ville, with sweater vests and polo shirts and khakis and Dockers.
I am an Air Force brat - that's the terminology they use for military kids who are traveling constantly.
I went to eight different schools my first nine years of school.
The best advice I get is actually from my family and friends. That has been a huge resource I've come to rely on.
I didn't grow up with a mother, so I don't have that resource to rely on and ask a million questions.
I do a lot of damage to my hair every day because of my work. I just noticed this huge change. It started getting thinner and it started falling out. I hit 30, and I literally felt like I was balding!
It's a comforting thought to know that I've got my partner by my side walking through life and all the ups and the downs. I know we can handle it. There's nothing too big or too crazy that's going to tear us apart.
I think as I've gotten older, I've learned to look at life and take every day as it comes.
