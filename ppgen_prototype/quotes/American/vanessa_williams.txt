Success is the sweetest revenge.
I am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different. I look at my daughters and I have different relationships with all three and there are parts of each personality that are very special.
I love the French horn.
The wiser you get, the more experience you have, and the more you see people for who they are as human beings, as opposed to figures you have to fight against.
There are a lot of things that you don't realize that your parents are going through when you're a kid.
My parents are both teachers, so we had the summers off.
I think there's a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there's a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it's a matter of planning, and being able to map out your year or your week or let's start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.
Broadway is really my life.
New York is my home.
And when people give me their word, I listen to them.
And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.
Well, my mom taught public school music for almost 40 years. And she's about 5 feet - and very mighty. And she would control her kids a lot by giving them the eye, or the stare.
You're always going to have people that are naysayers, that don't believe in your talent, that don't believe that you have any kind of longevity.
