American,Photographer
Never have I found the limits of the photographic potential. Every horizon, upon being reached, reveals another beckoning in the distance. Always, I am on the threshold.
Passion is in all great searches and is necessary to all creative endeavors.
Photography is a small voice, at best, but sometimes one photograph, or a group of them, can lure our sense of awareness.
I've never made any picture, good or bad, without paying for it in emotional turmoil.
The world just does not fit conveniently into the format of a 35mm camera.
