American,Novelist
In France, I learned about wine and cheese.
I use the city because it saves time, I don't have to do a lot of research on the setting.
I always liked spy stories.
I passed the Bar on the first shot, But I have never practiced law.
I met an American woman and got married so I had to get a job.
I keep working under the delusion that someday a library will ask for my manuscripts.
