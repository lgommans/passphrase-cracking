I am not a 'defender' of the September 11 attacks, but simply pointing out that if U.S. foreign policy results in massive death and destruction abroad, we cannot feign innocence when some of that destruction is returned.
They were targeting those people I referred to as 'little Eichmanns.' These were legitimate targets.
When you kill 500,000 children in order to impose your will on other countries, then you shouldn't be surprised when somebody responds in kind.
If U.S. foreign policy results in massive death and destruction abroad, we cannot feign innocence when some of that destruction is returned.
There's always merit to having a debate.
My comments are reserved for reputable journalists.
Truth is the best defense.
There is no consensus, there is no homogeneity, there is no truth.
I have never said that people 'should' engage in armed attacks on the United States, but that such attacks are a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful U.S. policy.
If I can't drive my old pickup to wherever I'm going, well, chances are good that I just won't go.
The term 'human rights defender,' incidentally, isn't something I or my attorneys came up with. Personally, I find it a little embarrassing.
