Science attempts to analyze how things and people and animals behave; it has no concern whether this behavior is good or bad, is purposeful or not. But religion is precisely the quest for such answers: whether an act is right or wrong, good or bad, and why.
Science is not gadgetry.
We keep, in science, getting a more and more sophisticated view of our essential ignorance.
