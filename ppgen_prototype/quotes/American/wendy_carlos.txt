American,Musician
A nice blend of prediction and surprise seem to be at the heart of the best art.
As human beings we do change, grow, adapt, perhaps even learn and become wiser.
Composition has almost always been solitary.
I'm really a very weak musicologist. Wish it weren't so, but there's only so much you can dig deeply into in one lifetime, as if you hadn't noticed.
