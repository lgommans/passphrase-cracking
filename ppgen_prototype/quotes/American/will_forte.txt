I'm kind of under the radar. Not a lot of people notice me. Which is surprising, because I'm so sexy. They're probably intimidated by my sexiness and crushability.
My life is littered with bad decisions.
It takes a certain type of person to register your 'Donkey Kong' score. So I'm just number 29 in registered Donkey Kong scores.
I don't know if I was a funny kid. I would say I was a loud and weird kid.
I feel like all my faults go into making the person that I am. I like myself as a person. And I think taking any fault away would change who I am as a person.
I'm not very good at impersonations.
You can do anything to my food and I'll still eat it.
