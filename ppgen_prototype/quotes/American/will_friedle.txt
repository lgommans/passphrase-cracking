I want to be in this business as long as this business will have me.
You have to contort your body in a certain way to hit a low note. When you're on film, you can't. So you do, in a sense, get to hide behind your voice, which is nice.
We all got lucky doing Boy Meets World.
It's fun to see a lot of the crowd become embarrassed. You're kind of watching them almost wanting to not watch the screen, but they have to because it's so compelling!
I'm such a video game fan that being able to do voices in video games is just fantastic.
I'm one of those guys that never get embarrassed.
I'll do anything to get the laugh. I love it.
I'd like to do voiceovers my whole life. I get to kind of create a character and go in and play.
I want to go out there and do the best work I can.
I had the honor and privilege of working with John Ritter.
I don't think, until the end, I had read a positive review of Boy Meets World.
Getting to meet people that I've admired my entire life, and getting to meet them in such a way where they're coming in to play completely different characters than I had ever seen them do is just wonderful.
Especially in the last 10 years, the writing on animated shows has jumped by leaps and bounds.
Bad reviews come with everything. I've been getting them my whole life.
All the directors that I've had the opportunity to work with are fantastic.
