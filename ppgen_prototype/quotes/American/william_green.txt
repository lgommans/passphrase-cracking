I feel like I have a new life and I'm going to take full advantage of it.
I'm grateful that the team allowed me back. I'm looking forward to making it up to them.
I've been doing a lot of learning from mistakes, first and foremost, and building off that.
It's just good to be back in the locker room.
They stayed by my side the whole time - my teammates, family and all the fans.
I'm using all my resources to help me with that and I feel the sky is the limit for me.
Football is what keeps me going, what makes me prosper, and what will keep me straight.
