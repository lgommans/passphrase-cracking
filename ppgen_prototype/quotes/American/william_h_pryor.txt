American,Judge
I believe that abortion is the taking of human life.
My Catholic faith is the foundation of my worldview, and my judicial duty is governed, from beginning to end, by the law.
Faith properly informs the religious lawyer or judge, and morality is not in tension with fidelity to the law.
Although the ACLU would argue that it is unconstitutional for me, as a public official, to do this in a government building, let alone at a football game, I will end with my prayer for the next administration: Please God, no more Souters.
I will never forget January 22, 1973, the day seven members of our highest court ripped up the Constitution.
I have a record as attorney general that is separate from my personal beliefs.
I am able to put aside personal beliefs and follow the law, even when I strongly disagree with it.
I believe that abortion is morally wrong.
I have, on several occasions, disagreed with decisions of Justice Souter.
Look at my record. I have done my duty.
The challenge of the next millennium will be to preserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian perspective.
