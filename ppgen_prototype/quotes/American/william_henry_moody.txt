American,Politician
I am one of the crucified dead.
It is always well to get near to men of genius.
The very air in which you live is an inspiration.
At the conclusion of my argument I received very high compliments from the Chief Justice and later from other of the Judges. What they said I do not care to repeat.
It was an argument of rare power and eloquence.
