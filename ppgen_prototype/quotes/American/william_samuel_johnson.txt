Curiosity is, in great and generous minds, the first passion and the last.
Hope is itself a species of happiness, and, perhaps, the chief happiness, which this world affords.
Hope is necessary in every condition. The miseries of poverty, sickness and captivity would, without this comfort, be insupportable.
He knows not his own strength who hath not met adversity.
To keep your secret is wisdom; to expect others to keep it is folly.
To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life.
It seems to be the fate of man to seek all his consolations in futurity.
Whatever enlarges hope will also exalt courage.
Whatever you have, spend less.
