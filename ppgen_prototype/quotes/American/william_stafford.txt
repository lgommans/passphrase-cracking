You don't need many words if you already know what you're talking about.
Kids: they dance before they learn there is anything that isn't music.
I have woven a parachute out of everything broken.
I'll be me, but I don't like it.
I just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing. The real question is, why did other people stop?
The more you let yourself be distracted from where you are going, the more you are the person that you are. It's not so much like getting lost as it is like getting found.
