American,Designer
Quality has always been the overriding factor for us. But you also have to have happy people working for you.
I always try to be a universalist, not a specialist.
I adjust my priorities according to the most important project I'm involved in at the time.
If we admit it or not, skiing is a little bit of show biz.
We have been around in the States in the ski wear market since the 1950s, but now we feel we can compete in the sportswear field.
Our clothes are expensive. I guess you could say we are aiming at the Yuppie market. But we feel America is moving away from quantity to the desire for quality. That is what we offer.
When you introduce something new to a country, you want to do it right. Generally, that means you have to do it yourself.
