American,Actor
I collect records pretty assiduously, so I've got, like, a massive record collection. I still DJ.
It's almost a joke how good I am at charades. Not to pat my own back, but I'm literally - I'm kind of unstoppable.
I've been having these dinner parties at my house in L.A. for years that turn into charades parties. I'm so good at breaking stuff down into syllables and sounds. If I were to be doing anything else besides being an actor, I would be a professional charades player. I'm not sure if it exists, but if it didn't, I'll create it.
I do like all different kinds of sports and stuff. I've taken up gymnastics and slacklining - you know, tightroping, basically.
Who didn't cry at 'The Notebook?' If you didn't cry at 'The Notebook,' something is probably wrong with you.
I actually got fired from 'The O.C.'
