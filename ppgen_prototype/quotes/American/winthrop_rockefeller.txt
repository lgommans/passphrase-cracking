American,Politician
Today is a great day, not only of healing and reconciliation, but also coming together. I'm so glad the whole Little Rock Nine was alive and here to see this.
I have enjoyed the personal use of money; but I have gotten the greatest satisfaction from using it to advance my beliefs in human relations, human values.
I yearn to see other chief executives throughout the nation follow suit, so that as a people we may hasten the elimination of barbarism as a tool of American justice.
