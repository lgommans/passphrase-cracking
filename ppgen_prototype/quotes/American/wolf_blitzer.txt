American,Journalist
We'll have to wait the old-fashioned way.
Looks like a pretty serious race unfolding.
My rule of thumb is that if I am interested or intrigued by something, others will be as well.
My best stories come from well-placed sources who point me in the right direction.
If you are a reliable, honest journalist, sources will open up and trust you and share good information.
There are millions and millions of patriotic Muslim Americans.
I have a few TVs.
My goal is to make the viewer a little bit smarter.
I love politics.
I eat right. I exercise. I run 5 miles a day on the treadmill.
My inclination, as an old-school, classically trained journalist, is not to go with a story unless I have it hard. It's not good enough to say something based on rumors that were flying around.
Two hours on television just doesn't automatically happen. I'm up early, I'm reading newspapers online, talking to my staff, coming up with ideas.
I'm a season ticket holder to the Washington Wizards, and I love going to Washington Nationals and Redskins games.
Almost every day I wrap up my two-hour live broadcast and I say to myself as I'm driving home, 'I wish I would've done this' or 'We really should have gone live longer with this segment.'
When I finished grad school, I sort of fell into journalism. Someone mentioned that there was an entry-level job at the Reuters News Agency. I applied, and, to my amazement, I got the job.
I love covering stories that have huge historic impacts.
I tend to overwrite; I need a good editor.
