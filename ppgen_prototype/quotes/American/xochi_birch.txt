American,Businesswoman
I was never a big-company type of person, and my ideal job was to be self-employed. The ironic thing is you work a lot harder for yourself than you do for anybody else.
My dad is Mexican, and he grew up as a normal chauvinistic Mexican, and he expected my mom to do everything for him.
One of my concerns for my children is growing up with your parents having a lot of money.
I feel there is a big sense of accomplishment and achievement and self worth through what you do no matter what the job, no matter what you decide to dedicate your life to.
