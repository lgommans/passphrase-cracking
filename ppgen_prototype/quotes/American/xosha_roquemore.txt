American,Actress
I'm sassy, even though I hate that word! I'm sensitive and cry real easily.
I'm like, over love. Crush, smush. I can't. I'm giving up on love at this point. I'm hoping for a crush. Actually, no. I don't want a crush. I want someone to crush on me.
I'm pretty goofy. I really do like to sing and dance in real life. I'm a rhythmic person. I love comedy; I love making people laugh. That's my brand.
When I'm not working... I'm an actor! I'm auditioning! I like to hang out, have fun, drink, club, meet boys, look for boyfriends, play MASH, the usual.
I'm a hoot and a half, I like to think.
I have, like, 45 celeb crushes at all times - celeb and Instagram crushes. I'm such a creep.
