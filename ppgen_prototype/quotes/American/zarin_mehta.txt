I think in all cultural organizations there has to be renewal. I'm also of a certain age that someone new can come in with a breath of fresh air. Things change, and I think that's important.
Too many people dwell on the past: the thing is to get on with life.
I grew up with music very much in my life. I achieved success by combining my training as an accountant with my family upbringing and love of music.
Accountancy prepares one to be able to run very different kinds of businesses, and my background prepared me for the music.
My paternal grandfather Rustom Mehta had a huge influence on me because of his ethics and his values.
I would still like to own and run a restaurant serving Indian food with a good dollop of Parsi cooking - which you can't seem to get anywhere.
