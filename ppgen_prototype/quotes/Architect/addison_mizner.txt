God gives us relatives; thank God, we can choose our friends.
Misery loves company, but company does not reciprocate.
Where there is a will there is a lawsuit.
Ignorance of the law excuses no man from practicing it.
Poets are born, not paid.
The worst-tempered people I've ever met were the people who knew they were wrong.
