English,Architect

In things to be seen at once, much variety makes confusion, another vice of beauty. In things that are not seen at once, and have no respect one to another, great variety is commendable, provided this variety transgress not the rules of optics and geometry.
A time will come when men will stretch out their eyes. They should see planets like our Earth.
