Since my Japanese isn't very good, I had to have an interpreter to communicate with most of the crew.
I didn't really discover yakuza films until about five or six years ago.
As you can probably tell, I like films and directors that bring a totally unique style to filming action.
To me, Shakespeare uses the supernatural elements to reveal his character's inner desires and fears.
And, of course, supernatural elements just make a story more interesting.
I had lived in Fukuoka during the mid 1990s, and I was a volunteer with the Fukuoka Asian Film Festival.
There aren't many American directors here trying to direct a Japanese yakuza film. When you combine that with the fact that I don't speak much Japanese and this was an independent film I was financing myself - people were curious about what I was doing.
The awesomeness of God is that even in the works of the Beach Boys, Beatles, etc., the beauty of the music is a mere reflection of what God does everyday. He creates music of all kinds and moods.
