Swiss,Architect
I prefer drawing to talking. Drawing is faster, and leaves less room for lies.
Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.
A house is a machine for living in.
The home should be the treasure chest of living.
To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.
Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.
A hundred times have I thought New York is a catastrophe and 50 times: It is a beautiful catastrophe.
