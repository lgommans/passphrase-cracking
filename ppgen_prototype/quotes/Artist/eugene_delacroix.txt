French,Artist
The artist who aims at perfection in everything achieves it in nothing.
Do all the work you can; that is the whole philosophy of the good way of life.
What moves those of genius, what inspires their work is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.
Do not be troubled for a language, cultivate your soul and she will show herself.
Talent does whatever it wants to do. Genius does only what it can.
Nature is a dictionary; one draws words from it.
A taste for simplicity cannot endure for long.
If one considered life as a simple loan, one would perhaps be less exacting. We possess actually nothing; everything goes through us.
