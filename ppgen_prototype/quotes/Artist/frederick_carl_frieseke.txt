Take a look at your natural river. What are you? Stop playing games with yourself. Where's your river going? Are you riding with it? Or are you rowing against it? Don't you see that there is no effort if you're riding with your river?
Your range of available choices - right now - is limitless.
The key to your universe is that you can choose.
Knowing where you're going is all you need to get there.
