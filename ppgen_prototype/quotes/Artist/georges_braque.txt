French,Artist
There is only one valuable thing in art: the thing you cannot explain.
Painting is a nail to which I fasten my ideas.
Truth exists; only lies are invented.
Once an object has been incorporated in a picture it accepts a new destiny.
To define a thing is to substitute the definition for the thing itself.
Art is made to disturb, science reassures.
Reality only reveals itself when it is illuminated by a ray of poetry.
