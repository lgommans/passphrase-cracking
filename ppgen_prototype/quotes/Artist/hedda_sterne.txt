Romanian,Artist
I was not an Abstract Expressionist. Nor was I an Irascible.
I knew I wanted to be an artist at age 5 or 6. I always drew. At 8, I was permitted to study.
Artists were always referred to as great artists. I thought that's what the profession was. One word: great-artist. There wasn't one moment in my life when I thought I wanted to be anything else.
For me, cooking is an extension of love.
