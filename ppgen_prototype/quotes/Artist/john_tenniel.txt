English,Artist
I carry out my work thus: I never use models or nature for the figure, drapery or anything else.
Well, I get my subject on Wednesday night; I think it out carefully on Thursday, and make my rough sketch; on Friday morning I begin, and stick to it all day, with my nose well down on the block.
By means of tracing-paper I transfer my design to the wood and draw on that.
