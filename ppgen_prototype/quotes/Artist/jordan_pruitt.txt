American,Artist
Someday I want to have my own clothing line, perfume and makeup line.
I auditioned for a play in fifth grade, and that's when I knew that I wanted to be a singer and performer.
I'm an all-American girl.
I can go without make-up and go fishing with my dad; other times, I buy pink shoes and shop for dresses.
Sixth grade was definitely a hard year for me. I got left out because I didn't go to any of the parties or hang out with the 'cool kids.' I was focusing on my academics. I wasn't allowed to go to any of the parties.
