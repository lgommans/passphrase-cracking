American,Artist
We don't have real hours and we don't have a boss, so artists create rules for themselves that they then break. It's transgressive in such a personal way.
When I was in art school, there was a stigma attached to coming from comfortable suburbia. If you were from Great Neck, Long Island, you couldn't be a 'real artist', so I found crafty ways of implying that I was from New York.
I'm innately conservative, and painting is an ideal place to exercise a progressive conservatism. I operate well within limits.
My favourite thing is to discover what someone does well and say, 'Do that for me.'
