Artist
They can put me in a jungle. Still, I can create.
I kept on trying to use so many media and ideas in my work because our horizon is so vast and Indian culture is so rich that I think what we are today, culturally, we have a unique position and I don't think one lifetime is enough to encompass it.
Mostly people are ignorant, what is the language of painting. You know, they're ignorant. It is so difficult to make them aware, but time will teach them.
All this talk about inspiration and moment is nonsense.
Wherever I find love I will accept it.
Ninety-nine percent of Indian people loved me and they still love me.
I'm an Indian-origin painter. I will remain so to my last breath.
I am an Indian and a painter, that's all.
I only give expression to the instincts from my soul.
India is my motherland.
I am like a folk painter. Paint and move ahead.
I think you don't do work for controversy alone, and whenever you do new work which people don't understand and they say it is done to create controversy.
I have not intended to denigrate or hurt the beliefs of anyone through my art.
