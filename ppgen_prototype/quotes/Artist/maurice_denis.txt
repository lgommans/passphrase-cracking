French,Artist
Remember that a painting - before it is a battle horse, a nude model, or some anecdote - is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order.
Art is when things appear rounded.
All artists are now free to express their own personality.
All that is necessary to paint well is to be sincere.
