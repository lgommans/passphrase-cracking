American,Artist
There is a hero built in all of us.
Trump is an icon. He is a part of American history. He is every bit the icon as anyone I paint.
I've been doing this since I was a kid. Then, I got in trouble for painting like this on the wall, but now, I get paid for it.
To me, this is the most awesome kind of art. When the music is right, everybody is as much a part of the art.
By the time I'm done with my show, I'm in Never-Never Land. Usually I leave the room for the auction and try to chill out.
I admire Trump for his accomplishments.
I thought, 'How cool would it be to paint Donald Trump in Donald Trump's house with Donald Trump there.'
I always found that Trump had this power about him.
This is where my notoriety comes from right now: from action art.
It's not about how high you jump. It's about how high everyone else jumps.
I think I only went to college because it was close to the karate school.
