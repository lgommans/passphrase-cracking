The mystery of the soul is like that of a closed door. When you open it, you see something which was not there before.
All that's left now is purely poetic work, putting more life into individual places, as I've made so sure of the fundamental mood and dimension of expression that it won't leave me groping around in uncertainty any more.
There is no such thing as a German, French, or Anglo-American Expressionism! There are only young people trying to find their bearings in the world.
Intellectually, I am already an old man. But in the sensory area, I am still such a child! I shuffle on my bottom between the two.
