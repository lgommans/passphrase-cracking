French,Artist
You cannot possibly invent painting all by yourself.
A painting that is well composed is half finished.
The precision of naming takes away from the uniqueness of seeing.
Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.
Draw your pleasure, paint your pleasure, and express your pleasure strongly.
You reason color more than you reason drawing... Color has a logic as severe as form.
Work on the accent, it will enliven the whole.
I'm trying to do what I have never done - give the impression one has on entering a room: one sees everything and at the same time nothing.
It is still color, it is not yet light.
Art will never be able to exist without nature.
The important thing is to remember what most impressed you and to put it on canvas as fast as possible.
I should like to present myself to the young painters of the year 2000 with the wings of a butterfly.
When you forget everything, there only remains yourself - and that is not enough.
One always talks of surrendering to nature. There is also such a thing as surrendering to the picture.
