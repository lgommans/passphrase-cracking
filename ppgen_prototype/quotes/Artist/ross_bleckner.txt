American,Artist
I see my studio like a laboratory, where I work like an investigator - it's almost forensic. I love the discovery process in painting.
I'm not really a foodie; I could eat the same thing every night, and I go to restaurants that I can walk to.
I like my surroundings to be pretty spare and severe. It helps me to concentrate on my work. All I ever do here is go from my studio to my bedroom. Everything else is extraneous. I never entertain, because to me, New York is about meeting people in public spaces, absorbing a little bit of their energy.
