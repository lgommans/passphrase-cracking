I like the spreads - designing them is a welcome challenge - but for a dyed-in-the-wool page-a-day journeyman like me, it can be tough to leave a drawing unfinished at the end of the workday.
Some artists are able to pull off a very form-fitting, painted-on look that's very modern, but I have actually come around to embracing the idea that that these costumes are more like athletic uniforms than high-tech skin suits.
The requirements for illustrating an eight-page story are as different from that of an ensemble-cast mini-series as they are different from a solo ongoing. Whether or not they're named Captain America or Ruby Thursday matters less to me than whether or not their characterization is consistent and actions logical... storytelling concerns.
I'm doing my best whether it's for a hundred-copy print run or for a hundred thousand.
Birds are hard to draw. I read recently that Katsuhiro Otomo also says he has trouble drawing animals, and while it made me feel better, it didn't make it easier for me.
