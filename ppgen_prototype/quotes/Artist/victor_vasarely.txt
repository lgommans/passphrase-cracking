Hungarian,Artist
In basic research, intellectual rigor and sentimental freedom necessarily alternate.
Every form is a base for colour, every colour is the attribute of a form.
I fight for the debunking of the artist and an end to individual pictures.
It is the original idea that is unique, not the object itself.
