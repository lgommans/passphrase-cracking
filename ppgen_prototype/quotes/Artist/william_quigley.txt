American,Artist
People go into a gallery, and they're afraid to express their opinions about art. No one's afraid to say, 'Keanu Reeves was bad in that movie.' We see so many films that we can tell who's faking it. But with art, we can't always tell.
I never wanted to be someone who's asking someone to put my work in their gallery. I wanted to be asked.
I love Boston.
Art should be witty, like a good Eddie Murphy movie, to make your life a little easier and better.
I love Boston. I come here all the time and play pick-up ice hockey with friends in Concord and Bedford.
