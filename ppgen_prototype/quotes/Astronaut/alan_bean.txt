I feel like there's too many paintings left unpainted that I just don't want to take the time away.
I think everything depends on money.
The moon is very rugged.
But I found that being an artist and doing accurate work is very difficult.
History has spurts and then is steady, and then maybe even backing up a step, and then forward again.
Eventually there are going to be cities in space.
I can remember walking on the moon.
I have the nicest life in the world.
One of the great things about the universe is that it's fair.
I found I have to stay painting.
It's hard not to be excited when you're going to find a way to land on the moon.
We knew it was going to be difficult to get to the moon. We didn't know how difficult.
But I'm the only one who can paint the moon, because I'm the only one who knows whether that's right or not.
