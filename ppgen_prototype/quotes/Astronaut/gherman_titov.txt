Russian,Astronaut
We thought our careers as cosmonauts - we were young then - would end with a flight to Mars. But, you see, life has made some course corrections.
I am Eagle! I am Eagle!
It is difficult to express in words the feelings of happiness and pride which fill me.
I wasn't a very convenient person for the leadership. I had my own opinion about things and knew how to insist on this.
We were young, we were pilots, and we were hungry to test the new technology of 'space machines.' And we all wanted to be first.
It's a pity I flew only once. A space flight is like a drug - once you experience it, you can't think of anything else.
