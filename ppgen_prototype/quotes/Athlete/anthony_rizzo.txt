One game, one pitch can change everything for a hitter. The way I like to approach it is that every at-bat is its own unique opportunity to go out there and do something really good.
I will respect the limits of my experience but that won't stop me from trying to lead by example of my work. Being a good teammate and picking them up on and off the field is a simple goal of mine.
Every day there is something new you are working on. It is a challenge every day and that is what makes this game so great.
I have to go with the approach I had in Triple-A. I need to take a lot of those fastballs I am seeing to left field. Also must gear up for the changeup and take them up the middle.
You obviously want the results but you must do your job in every at-bat and deal with what every situation dictates.
I believe that everything you work at and want in life is a great challenge.
I don't believe a player is ever a finished product.
