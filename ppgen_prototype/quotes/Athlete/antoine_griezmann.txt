My objective is to be among the best.
I always play with long sleeves because Beckham always did it. He is my idol. He had a lot of class both on the pitch and outside. Nobody had his right foot. I would love to speak with him, but in Spanish because I don't speak English.
I was just a kid who had arrived in the world of professional football and thought he could do anything he wanted. But I have learned from my mistakes. I have done everything to change, both on and off the pitch.
I always demand intensity in training. That's my style, and I like it.
I'm very happy at Atletico. I'm very proud to play for these fans, with these players, and with this coach. I want to try and pay back the confidence and care that the people at Atletico have always shown me.
My goal is always to improve what has been done the previous season and also collectively seek to do better than the year past.
The United States is where I want to finish. I love the States. I want to have a subscription to NBA and go with my children to every game. I can already see myself there. I do not yet know the city, but why not play for Beckham's franchise in Miami? Playing under Beckham would be the best.
