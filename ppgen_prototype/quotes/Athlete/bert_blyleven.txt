Your goal as a hitter is to get on. And if the third baseman is playing back and letting you lay down a bunt, I don't have a problem with that, even if it's late in a no-hitter.
I knew that I wasn't a first-ballot Hall-of-Fame inductee.
I'm from Southern California, so I feel much more comfortable with a golf club in my hand than I do a weapon.
My dad introduced me to baseball. Then one of my friends asked if I could play on a team; my dad said I could, and I just fell in love with the game.
I'm probably one of the few people that liked 'Water World' with Kevin Costner.
I really like Kansas City Royals stadium - Kauffman Stadium.
I love baseball. I love watching baseball. As a broadcaster, I get to watch the best 700 players put on the uniform year after year. That, to me, is exciting.
When you're not at the top of your game and you feel like the other team is laughing and embarrassing you by doing certain things, it's time to retaliate.
