I loved the opportunity to play for the Yankees, too.
I've been in eleven no-hitters you know.
In 83 I thought we were going to go all the way. We had Roy Smalley, and Steve King, and good players.
So to get to play for the Yankees was really exciting. Really exciting.
Well, I wanted to play twenty years in the major leagues. I never made it twenty though. I played nineteen.
Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees are so famous for Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig, all of those guys.
Yes, I was in that game where George Brett hit that home run. Billy saw there was too much pine tar on the bat and he went to the umpire, the next thing we knew they were fighting about it.
