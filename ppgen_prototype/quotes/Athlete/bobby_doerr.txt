We lived near a playground that had four baseball diamonds on it, and when I got to be 11, 12 years old, I was always over at the ballpark practicing or playing or doing something pertaining to baseball. And when I wasn't doing that, I was bouncing a rubber ball off the steps of my front porch at home.
I never did work in the off-season, and I never did play winter ball or anything else. I think it was good for me to get away after a full season... In those days, I don't think anyone ever got too complacent.
Even after I played ten years of ball, I still felt like I had to play well or somebody might take my place. They had plenty of players in the minor leagues who were good enough to come up and take your job, and I think that kept us going all of the time. I hustled and put that extra effort in all of the time.
Now Joe Cronin was very good. I loved Joe Cronin, to play for.
