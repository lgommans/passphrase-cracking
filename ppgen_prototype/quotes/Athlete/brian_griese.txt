The only thing I want to be able to do is come in and learn the offense, go out there and compete, show what I am capable of doing and try to get better as a football player.
I'm going to go out and try to be the best player I can be and help the Chicago Bears win.
I really believe the only thing you can control in those situations is what you do as a player but also how you interact with your teammates, which is critical.
We've got a lot of potential on offense. But really potential doesn't mean much if you don't realize it.
I'm going to go out there and work hard. I'm going to get better, I'm going to learn from my mistakes and I'm going to be there when my team needs me.
