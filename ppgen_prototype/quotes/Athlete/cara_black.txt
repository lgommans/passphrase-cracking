Zimbabwean,Athlete
I read French much better than I speak.
I once rode a motorcycle across Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco!
One of my assets is my fitness. My fitness around the net and my movement: that's my defense to the power.
Sport's always a good thing - it's healthy, and it takes your mind off other things.
