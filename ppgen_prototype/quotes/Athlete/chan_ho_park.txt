My main problem has been staying healthy.
This year, I feel strong. I'm looking forward to having my best season in the last few years.
This is normal, to have pressure. It's how you respond. Take the pressure, use the pressure, have fun.
We have a good team, and I think we'll have a good season this year.
I want to be a starter again, I would really enjoy playing for the Phillies again, but my first consideration in making my decision is finding a circumstance that is right for me. I want to play for the Phillies again, but I also wouldn't mind joining a team I've never played with before.
