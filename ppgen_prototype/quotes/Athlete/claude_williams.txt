I used to like whiskey. But it's been a long time since I've been drunk.
I'm a sweet eater. I love lemon pie and sweet potato pie.
I don't see any reason to quit playing. I'll be doing this at least till I get to a hundred and something. You know, I ain't got far to go. But I'm still going to be playing, as long as I have good ideas, and can play as I do.
