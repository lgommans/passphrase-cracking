Iraqi,Athlete
To be able to live and train in Iraq under these circumstances you need to be brave.
Sports can unify the Iraqi people - no Sunnis, no Shiites, just sport for the country.
I'm very ambitious, despite all the challenges I face in the streets.
As long as I have ambition, maybe I can achieve something for my country.
Life must continue, even with the security situation so bad, because I have ambitions. I love this sport too much.
If I leave this sport, I think life will stop.
I need one psychological expert to help me concentrate.
Despite all these obstacles and bad security situation, I have the energy and the resolve to train, but my head is full of ideas and it distracts me, and I need to focus.
It's my dream, my goal to be good at Olympics, anywhere they are in the world.
