It's very difficult for my body to recover after workouts now that I'm older, so we have to keep them short, which means they're extremely difficult and intense. It sucks.
I feel like I have so many middle-aged women who look up to me.
I'm so freaking competitive it's unbelievable.
I can't dance.
When I feel like my body is exhausted, I focus on making my fifth Olympic team so I can push through it.
I get out of the pool after a workout and look on my BlackBerry to see if the nanny called and to make sure everything's okay. My child is always on my mind.
As for swimming, I'm now in the pool 5 days a week from 8 to 10 a.m. And I'm in the gym for an hour and a half, 4 days a week. Two days upper body, two days lower.
