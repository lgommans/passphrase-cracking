We didn't score any runs today. That's not my fault.
It's always frustrating when you leave people on base.
As soon as he hit it, I thought I had it. But I lost it when it went into the lights. I did my best.
I know how to prepare my head.
I don't get nervous.
I feel it's the best thing that could have happened for me, leaving the Braves so I could go to another team that would give me more of a chance to play like with the Marlins.
When I did play, I tried to make the most of it.
I don't know nothing about nothing.
I come to spring training and just try to do my job, try to do the best I can. That's all any player can do.
I need to work on everything.
In baseball, you've got to keep working.
