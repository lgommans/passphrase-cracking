American,Athlete
Asian Americans are the same as African American, Hispanic Americans, anyone: we deserve to be respected, too.
We moved to a town that's predominately Caucasian, some Hispanic and one or two black families, and they do shrimping for a living. Here come hundreds of Vietnamese doing the same occupation. So there was a lot of tension because people were saying we were taking money, shrimp, fish or whatever it is.
I got into sports, thankfully, because I didn't listen to my mother.
The best thing about high school football in the state of Texas is the whole town shuts down, and there's shoe polish all over businesses and stores. Everyone rallies around you.
