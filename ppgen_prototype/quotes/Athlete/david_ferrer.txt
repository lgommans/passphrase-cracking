You can write 'little beast' if you want, but my name is David Ferrer.
Tennis doesn't owe me anything. Tennis is one of the fairest sports. It's given me so many extraordinary feelings.
I always try and do my best and put out the best and find the best in me, as well. But I'm not thinking about it beforehand.
Winning a Grand Slam is not something I'll think about.
