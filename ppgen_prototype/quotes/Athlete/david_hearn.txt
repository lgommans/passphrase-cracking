Putting is an art. When you're not feeling confident on the greens, it will affect the rest of your game.
You have to have fine motor control to make putts when you need them the most. That's why golf is such a challenge - you go from extreme power to slowing down and making putts when you need them.
I played hockey in the winter, and then I would play golf in the summer. But I always knew I'd be a golfer.
When I got onto PGA Tour Canada right out of college, I was competitive more quickly than when I got onto the PGA Tour, but that just shows you how much work and effort it takes to get to the world stage. The best players in the world are the best at dealing with those emotions.
When you're in your young 20s, you know you can play good golf into your mid-40s. That's a lot of time to get better each and every year and achieve your goals. As long as you know you're making strides along the way, you'll get there eventually.
Some guys seem to jump right out and win tournaments, but for me, I've been the kind of player who is getting a bit better each year.
The reasons that major champions are the best in the game is because they're able to keep golf at its most simple. It really boils down to making good shots and good putts when you need to, regardless of what the golf course looks like.
