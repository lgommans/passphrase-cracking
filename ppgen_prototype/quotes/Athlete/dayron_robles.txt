American,Athlete
When I'm in good form there are chances that rivals will worry more about you more than you about them.
I am my own main rival.
I'm looking to get in the best shape possible for London and not worrying about rivals.
The Olympic games are already there and we don't have even half of what you need to train well.
I'm continuing to prepare very well because I have my responsibility and my (pride) as a man and an athlete.
This is the home of hurdling, and the Americans are the kings of the event.
I am very fired up to run in New York.
The objective is to do things well in London.
