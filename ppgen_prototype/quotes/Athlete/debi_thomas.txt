My mother introduced me to many different things, and figure skating was one of them. I just thought that it was magical having to glide across the ice.
Just because you didn't start out perfect doesn't mean you can't have an excellent result in the end.
I tell people I'm too stupid to know what's impossible. I have ridiculously large dreams, and half the time they come true.
For as long as I can really remember, I wanted to be a doctor.
I am not really sure how I got interested in medicine.
I begged my mom to let me start skating.
I just thought that it was magical having to glide across the ice.
I was always very strong in math, physics and calculus.
I watch a lot of professional skating, and I am really looking forward to going to nationals.
I would make my mom buy me the toy doctor kit.
My skating is a very emotional thing that comes from the heart, never doing it for the medal.
Probably the '86 nationals. That was my first real national title and first real statement I ever made in figure skating, and my life changed after I returned.
Right now I am doing my residency in orthopedic research.
So I went for engineering, specifically product design, which I enjoyed.
The Olympics: not one of my better memories.
What was most important to me at the Olympics was going out there and performing my best. When I messed up the first jump combination, which was my big move, it hit me that I messed up the program of my life.
I got a bronze medal and I can't complain about that, the only African-American to get a medal in the Winter Olympics.
I've got this thing with skating and school - to see how much I can accomplish.
Being an Olympian, I always have this strong belief in excellence.
But I like it when my patients are impressed not knowing that I was an Olympian.
I wanted to be a doctor since I was five.
I want people to know when I'm taking care of them I'll give it all that I've got.
