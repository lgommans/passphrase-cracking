Football can generate excitement and bring people together.
In football, the good thing is things can change in a second.
People think footballers are all like robots - we can control everything on the pitch. But your heart is beating 200 times a minute; it's very, very physical.
I believe a lot in destiny and I think that if something didn't happen, it was for a reason.
I have won many trophies in my time, but nothing will ever top helping win the battle for peace in my country.
I feel at home when I go to London.
People have an opinion of Africa and it is not so good, but we have to let sport unite us all.
I prefer people to see me as an Ivorian and as a patriot.
When you don't win games, yeah, you lose confidence. That's normal.
Having a stadium in France named after a footballer from the Ivory Coast, even if I'm proud of my France-Ivory Coast background, is a great proof of integration.
In England, I've never really had a problem with racism.
When I arrived in France, I cried every day. Not because I was in France - I could have been anywhere - but because I was so far, far away from my parents. I missed them so much.
Coaches can teach you two things: confidence and technique.
