Good pitchers, after a tough outing, bounce back. Real good pitchers don't let too many poor games get in there.
With the White Sox, when we do stuff, everybody's opinion is asked for, is given and then decisions are made on just about everything.
I'm not in charge of making moves, you know. I'm in charge of coaching.
I don't believe there's a baseball job that I couldn't take care of.
That whole thing about, 'Hey, ex-catchers are the best managers.' Listen, pitching coaches have some brains, too. Sometimes they're not all there, but sometimes they are.
I've gotta believe that my managing tenure has come to an end here.
