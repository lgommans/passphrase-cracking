A pitcher has to look at the hitter as his mortal enemy.
A pitcher is only as good as his legs.
A pitcher will never be a big winner until he hates hitters.
I've got a right to knock down anybody holding a bat.
That space between the white lines, that's my office. That's where I conduct my business.
I don't like losing a ballgame any more than a salesman likes losing a sale.
