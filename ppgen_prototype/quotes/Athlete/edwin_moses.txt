My concentration level blocks out everything. Concentration is why some athletes are better than others. You develop that concentration in training and concentrate in a meet.
I used biomechanics to save time when I was competing.
I always had to keep improving my skills in order to remain competitive and keep winning.
In digital world, sport provides opportunity to bring people together.
I never struggled with injury problems because of my preparation - in particular my stretching.
I was always a mean and lean athlete - not tall - not large.
I overcame size with mechanics.
Lots of people let it go by and never accomplish what they want. I just wanted to see what I could do.
I wanted to go to medical school. But, I never got a college scholarship.
I went to Moorehouse College. There was no track and field there.
One of my major competitors was Harold Smith. Smith beat me in 1977. I was loafing during that competition.
I always got my work done before playing.
I was always more of an academic than a jock.
In particular, I studied German and Russian biomechanics.
Stretching was a major part of my preparation.
Both parents supported my becoming a world class athlete.
My father was an all-American football player.
My father was also a principal of a school and mother was a curriculum advisor. Both were educators.
The joint lubrication was not what it was when I was competing, and I decided that not having arthritis or rheumatism for the rest of my life was a lot more important to me than returning to the track.
I didn't get an athletics scholarship at a major school.
