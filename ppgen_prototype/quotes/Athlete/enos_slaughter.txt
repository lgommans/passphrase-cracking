I asked no odds and I give none. A guy got in my way, I run over him.
From that day on, I ran from spot to spot.
To be a big league ball player, you have to love the game.
So I say keep yelling and hustling every minute you're in uniform.
I learned early on to never walk while I was on the ball field. I ran everywhere I went.
