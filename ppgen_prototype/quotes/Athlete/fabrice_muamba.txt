Athlete
I am walking proof of the power of prayer.
Family and God - that is what's important. Money, cars, those are things that come and go.
For me there is no such word as 'luck' in the dictionary.
There's more to life than football, right?
I don't particularly get nervous about anything.
I'm a very competitive person.
I've lived most people's dream by playing football.
You don't appreciate life until you get to the other side. Like lying in a hospital bed.
