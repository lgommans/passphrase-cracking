You don't have to be popular with the players to be a good manager or coach.
I'm dumbfounded, but nothing surprises me in this game.
Manchester was a fantastic place to go out in. There were 10 clubs with world-class cabaret and comedians. You'd go in and Tom Jones might be singing, or Shirley Bassey or Engelbert Humperdinck.
I would love to have played with David Silva.
