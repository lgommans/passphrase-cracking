It's never nice to lose someone close to you; unfortunately, life goes on, and we have to make peace with it and move on.
I think rugby is 80 per cent mental.
As soon as you have an average game, everyone is quick to criticise and say, 'You suck; you shouldn't be playing rugby.'
You never know what battles people fight.
