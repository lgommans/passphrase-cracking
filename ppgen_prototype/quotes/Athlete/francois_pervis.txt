French,Athlete
I checked on the Internet this morning, and I realized that with five individual world titles, I was level with my elders Florian Rousseau and Arnaud Tournant, who were the sprint leaders in France when I started at the French Institute of Sports and taught me everything. I had the chance to overtake them, and I did it.
It's good to break records, I love it.
A sprinter is never satisfied; otherwise, he is not a sprinter.
