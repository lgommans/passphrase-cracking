I cannot let this opportunity pass without placing on record how much I have enjoyed my cricket with Kent.
I don't think I ever worked harder at any match during my career to get runs as I did then, nor did I ever have to face in one game such consistently fast bowlers as the Australian pair, Gregory and McDonald.
I was not depressed when they got me out. I have always taken my dismissals as part of the game.
In the old days we were probably educated in cricket in a far more serious way than now.
It is amazing how the public steadfastly refuse to attend the third day of a match when so often the last day produces the best and most exciting cricket.
It was never a policy of the Kent team that the pitch must be occupied all day after winning the toss.
Lots of times I was out through forcing the game.
Square cuts which ordinarily would have flashed to the boundary earned only two, and I believe that those two innings would have been worth 150 apiece in a county match.
Still, I believe it is only a passing phase and cricket will one day produce an abundance of great players.
Those were the great days when plenty of amateurs could spare time for cricket.
We always had to play the game and play for the team. It is a Kent tradition.
