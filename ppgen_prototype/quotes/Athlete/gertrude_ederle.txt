I was happiest between the waves.
The doctors told me my hearing would get worse if I continued swimming, but I loved the water so much, I just couldn't stop.
To me, the sea is like a person - like a child that I've known a long time. It sounds crazy, I know, but when I swim in the sea, I talk to it. I never feel alone when I'm out there.
I am not a person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars.
Oh, I eat whatever I want whenever I want it.
Of course one can't eat in a civilized fashion while touring in theatres. But I still manage to get my three meals a day. I find that is sufficient for training.
God has been good to me.
Don't weep for me; don't write any sob stories.
