In life, you need many more things besides talent. Things like good advice and common sense.
There are many kids in and out of baseball who think that just because they have some natural talent, they have the world by the tail.
When I see three balls, I just swing at the middle one.
In 1930, I was at the top of my career. I won the Most Valuable Player award.
Kids, don't be too big to accept advice.
