American,Athlete
I say my greatest strength is my speed, and I think that I could use some work on my concentration.
My favorite team while I was growing up was the New Orleans Saints. My favorite player was Joe Horn.
I am a big fan of Chad Johnson. I think that I would compare myself to him as well.
