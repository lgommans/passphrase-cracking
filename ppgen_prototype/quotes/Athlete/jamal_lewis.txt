As long as I can stay north or south, I'm gaining yards.
If I'm going east and west, nothing's happening.
I like to hit it downhill, that's the way I was taught to run.
I really liked watching Bo Jackson run just because of his size and his speed.
Watching Bo Jackson, seeing his size, his speed, a lot of his abilities, really drove me.
Luckily, I have the good fortune of being on the same team as Ray Lewis. I don't have to face him on Sunday.
As far as a guy like Ray Lewis is concerned, you know he's going to be around the ball all the time.
That's what we really mean by being feared on the football field. And not actually the player that fears him, it's the offensive coordinator that fears him or the running backs coach.
When your name is out there like that, guys are going to want to see what you're about.
A team is a team.
I never did have a team that I watched in my younger days.
I don't watch that much football... I really like to play it.
I chose Tennessee because I thought they'd give me an opportunity to play.
I also wanted to play with Peyton Manning because I thought he could teach me a lot, and he did.
I hope we can build our offense and go out there and win games.
I am a responsible parent and have always provided for my children. That fact cannot be disputed. I have made mistakes in my life, but failing to care for my children is not one of them.
