British,Athlete
I'd love to win Wimbledon.
I love my life. I'm very fortunate for the opportunities that I have and whatever, but I haven't got to the level where people are interested in where I walk my dog or anything like that, which is fine by me.
My career's had a lot of ups and downs. Once I started playing with John Peers in 2013, that gave me a huge lift, a lot of direction, which I needed.
