My success is the team's success. It's one of those things to a certain degree that it's effort and ability but also how I benefit from what my teammates do, and then it is up to me to perform.
In the game of football, you can never be too sure of anything.
I like to win, I like to compete and I like to sack the quarterback. I imagine there's a team out there looking for that.
I am critical of myself.
Everybody gets all worked up about trash talk but it is what it is - it's talk... You ask any player, honestly, if trash talk's gonna affect how hard they play, because if a little trash talk affects how hard they can play, it just lets us know that they were holding back or weren't playing harder or as hard as they could.
I like to win; I like to compete; I like to sack the quarterback.
Guess in my brain I have a figurative 'man card' that's got certain punches that need to be punched.
