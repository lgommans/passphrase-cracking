Confidence is king in golf.
I played a lot of baseball growing up, and I always hit better if I kept moving before the pitch instead of standing still in the batter's box. I think a waggle does the same thing in the golf swing. It keeps you relaxed and gets your body ready to hit the ball.
People have kind of latched on with my personality and how I play golf and how I carry myself. It seems like every town we go to, I'm experiencing newer things with these types of fans.
It's great to have a lot of support; people recognizing what you're doing out there and identifying with you in whatever way they see fit is a great fit, I think, and for me it's neat, for people to want to come to the golf course and watch me play golf.
There's always motivation coming into Majors. If you can't get up and get excited to win one of these, then you probably shouldn't be playing golf.
I watch a lot of sports. One of the reasons I watch is to see how these guys handle pressure, how they respond to situations.
