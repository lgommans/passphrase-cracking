Mexican,Athlete
The most important thing is to have opportunities and feel confidence in yourself.
We are a big family; we are all very close, and we always want to talk about what is going on with each other.
At times, my confidence is rock bottom, although I try for it to be sky high, thanks to the people that are always there with me and support me.
If you want to win the World Cup, you need to play against the best national teams in the world.
What I miss most about Mexico isn't the food or the customs; it's my family and the way we'd all sit around chatting together.
I think every national team has the same possibilities to win the World Cup.
Moving to a new country is always difficult, but the fact my dad and my sister came to live with me was a huge help. That made things easier.
