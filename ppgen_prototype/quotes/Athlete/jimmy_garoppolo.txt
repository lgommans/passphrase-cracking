I like to think I'm pretty close in comparison to Aaron Rodgers. He's very athletic and gets the ball out quickly. He's very knowledgeable of the game, controls the offense totally, and that's something I try to do. Just know the offense inside and out.
There's not much simplifying. You gotta know what you gotta know. That's how the quarterback position is, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
You see guys in the NFL when you're younger, and you try to model your game after that.
I started playing quarterback my junior year of high school.
By making yourself better, that's how you make your team better.
That's why we all play the game. You want to be a player; you want to be out there to play.
Just like my agent had told me, Tom Brady is a really cool, down to earth guy.
