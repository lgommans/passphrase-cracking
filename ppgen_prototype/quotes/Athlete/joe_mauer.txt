I love catching, being involved in every pitch of the game; obviously, it beats you up both mentally and physically.
I like Lil Wayne.
I hate striking out, doesn't matter what time of the game. I just don't like striking out.
Nobody wants to hear me rap.
I'm not as cool as I'm supposed to be.
As you get older, you learn there are some things out of your control.
It frustrates me if I'm not good at something, so I do it until I get good at it.
I don't even attempt to sing.
