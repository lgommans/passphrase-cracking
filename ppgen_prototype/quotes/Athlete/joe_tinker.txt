You cannot expect to be on intimate terms with everybody on your club, and there is no reason why you should be, so long as you are playing the game.
Because a man is placed in charge of a club does not make it necessary for him to be a taskmaster or a tyrant. In my opinion, he ought to be as lenient with his club as circumstances allow, and the less he interferes with the personal liberties of the men, the better.
I know better than anyone else that my time is near. I've had a good life, and you don't stop and complain at this stage of the game. I've made some mistakes, and I'd like to stay around a little longer and overcome them, but there isn't time. I'll miss baseball. That I know.
