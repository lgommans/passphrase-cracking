Football is a game of mistakes. Whoever makes the fewest mistakes wins.
Soccer is simple, but it is difficult to play simple.
Speed is often confused with insight. When I start running earlier than the others, I appear faster.
Every disadvantage has its advantage.
I look at Messi, and he makes me laugh. A beautiful footballer who is still like a kid. A world superstar, but still a kid. Innocent, you know. He just plays.
Without the ball, you can't win.
One trophy is good, but two are better. That way, when a hero wears his medals on his chest, at least his steps are level as he walks by.
Italians can not beat us, but we can certainly lose against them.
I'm not religious. In Spain all 22 players make the sign of the cross before they enter the pitch. If it works all matches must therefore end in a draw.
Sometimes something's got to happen before something is going to happen.
Footballers from the street are more important than trained coaches.
You have got to shoot, otherwise you can't score.
Before I make a mistake, I don't make that mistake.
Coincidence is logical.
I don't want to be a thief of my own wallet.
The disabled people that do sport, they don't think about what they don't have but try to get better with what they do have. That is the same for me.
Football is about having the best offensive play possible. I always like to play offensive football, and nobody will convince me otherwise.
To win you have to score one more goal than your opponent.
My foundation now has some 120 football pitches laid out for children, a lot of them immigrants. We live in a multicultural society.
Ajax is a multicultural club, and we have found that many talented immigrant players quit when they reach puberty. So we wanted to tackle this problem with someone from the same background who had come through it. And that was Edgar Davids. During one of our fights, I pointed that out to him. But it had nothing to do with his skin colour.
