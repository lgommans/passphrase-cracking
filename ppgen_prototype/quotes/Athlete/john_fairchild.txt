I have learned in fashion to be a little savage.
My new life is being with my wife without any interference, and the children come see us every once in a while.
People say 'Women's Wear' is a scandalous, gossipy publication. Sure we have gossip; we also have some very, very solid business stories. We are a creation of this business, which is fast, mean, tough, sometimes artistic, sometimes horrible.
I find it an exhausting experience, personally, to go to a party every night.
I can't stand the idea of missing something. I've got to know what's going on - it's like an animal instinct with me.
At 'Women's Wear', I always said, 'Get it first - get the bacon.'
