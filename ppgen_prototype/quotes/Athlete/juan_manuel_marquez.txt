Boxing is always serious.
I started boxing when I was eight. Me and my brother Rafael started boxing in amateur tournaments when I was 13. My father was an ex-pro boxer.
I used to like studying a lot.
I want that fifth championship. If that does not present itself, then I'm closer to retirement.
I believe that each fight teaches you something, and a new history is written in each fight.
Manny Pacquiao always makes a fake move that I know too well. He fakes a charge forward and then looks like he is going to follow with a one-two. That's a common fake he has.
Boxing is always serious. Nothing comical or funny about boxing.
At noon I get to the gym to do my boxing workout. Three hours there. Rest. Once in a while I get a massage, because I need it once in while.
I felt good in all my fights. It's all in the preparation. I prepare myself for all of them. And I felt good in all my fights.
