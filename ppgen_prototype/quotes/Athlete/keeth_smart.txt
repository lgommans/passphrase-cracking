In my job, whenever I delivered a presentation I would rehearse several times before the actual event. In sport, it is important to be equally prepared about my opponents.
Being properly prepared is one of the biggest assets in business and in athletic competition.
Some of my competitors overlook the importance of knowing as much as possible about their opponents, but I think that it is an invaluable asset that I have gained from working.
I've always dreamed of an Olympic medal.
Brooklyn is a very weird borough.
