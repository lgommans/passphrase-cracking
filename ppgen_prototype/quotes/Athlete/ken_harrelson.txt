In baseball you hit your home run over the right-field fence, the left-field fence, the center-field fence. Nobody cares. In golf everything has got to be right over second base.
In a blind town, the one-eyed man is king.
I have my detractors, no doubt about it. I look at it as a compliment.
Toughest job in baseball is the general manager. Second toughest is the hitting coach.
I'm a big boy, and I'm a tough guy.
