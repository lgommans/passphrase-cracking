I look at myself as a game-changer, and I try to make that a facet of my game.
We have to back each other up no matter what. Defense, you have to do your job, and offense has to do theirs.
Roger Goodell is doing his job. He's front office. Whatever he says goes, and I'll leave it at that.
I prefer to play inside linebacker.
I'm the type of guy that likes to lead by example.
I like to let my work ethic speak for itself, just things of that nature, like the way I go about practice and show these guys how to do it.
A lot of guys, especially the young guys, I try to do anything I can for them - on the field, off the field, anything.
I just want to be great. I want to stand out, be a great leader for this defense, and I'm just trying to leave it all out on the field.
I can't get carried away with having a good time because everyone, especially the young guys, have to know there's a time and place for everything.
I don't feel as if I have to force anything. I just have to play my game.
