I'd rather be lucky than good.
I've got a new invention. It's a revolving bowl for tired goldfish.
If you don't throw it, they can't hit it.
I'm the guy that made Joe DiMaggio famous.
I was the worst hitter ever. I never even broke a bat until last year when I was backing out of the garage.
The secret of my success was clean living and a fast outfield.
No one hit home runs the way Babe did. They were something special. They were like homing pigeons. The ball would leave the bat, pause briefly, suddenly gain its bearings, then take off for the stands.
