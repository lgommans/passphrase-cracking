I was glad to play in the Negro Leagues. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
It would mean a lot to me to get into the Hall of Fame, to be grouped with some of the greatest players in history.
I was in Cuba in the winter of 1937. I was playing in Cuba, and I'm in the shower, and I slipped and caught myself with my right arm. I felt something pull right then. Then, in '38, when I came back, my arm was messed up.
Until spring training in 1946, the only time I pitched was in 1945 in the GI World Series.
