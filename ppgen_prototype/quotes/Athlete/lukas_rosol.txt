Every single match, every single point, I have to concentrate.
Sometimes I can wake up and I can beat anyone.
Sometimes, how I said already, I just wake up and play good. And sometimes I'm so tired.
For me, it's important to stay healthy more than it is to have one good victory.
I never had goals to be in the top 10 or top five in the world. I just try to find the borders, find what level I can reach. I have a good team around me, so hopefully it's going to get even better.
