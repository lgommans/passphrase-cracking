God guided me to America and gave me a good job. But he also gave me a heart so I would look back.
I love my family.
I'd like to do things to make money to save myself but right now I can't do nothing. If they want to put me in jail, they can do that. It's kind of tough.
I'm not a violent person.
I've gone to war zones before and never got shot.
If God wants to take my left arm, that's OK, as long as I can walk and play with my kids. I'm a lot improved. I was worse than this after the accident.
There's a lot of bad things going on but I didn't do nothing.
Didn't the other guys tell you? Nobody dunks on Manute B-O-L!
