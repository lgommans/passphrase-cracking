The back, it's frustrating. It's hard to figure out. You go to bed feeling good, and you wake up tight. It seems like, when you have a bad back, your whole body feels like crap.
I know where my game is. I know I'm a power hitter and an RBI guy. I need to get on base for my teammates behind me and just stick with my game. I don't try to do too much. Sometimes when you try to do too much in this game you pretty much can't do anything. And that's pretty much my mentality.
As soon as you get traded, you kind of start thinking where you're going to live, your family, you have to pack.
But hitting is so crazy. You feel great today and get three hits. And the next day you show up and it's, 'What happened to my mechanics? Where's my swing?' Sometimes I even Google it and the search comes up with no results.
I'm one of those guys that's going to show up to the field and try my best.
The body doesn't recover like it does when you're younger.
When things are going good, you've got to enjoy it, right?
