No matter how fast or how slow you get to the quarterback, it all goes to slow motion when you get there. Everything just stops. You don't see anything but the quarterback. You don't hear anything but the quarterback's breath. It's almost like you're a shark. Your eyes get real big and everything's just quiet.
Quarterbacks are untouchable nowadays. If you hit a quarterback too hard, or if you fall on him with too much weight - which is a judgment thing from a professional standpoint - you're going to get flagged.
I'm 300 pounds. If I fall on anybody, it's going to hurt.
You've got to be careful of guys trying to chop-block you. You know, running backs, the receivers. You've got to just hope that your knees are fine and you can avoid those chop blocks.
I don't have an ego; I'm not egotistical or anything like that.
I'm used to being the underdog.
You can never, ever worry about making mistakes or things like that. I'm going to go out and play ball, and that's what I do.
