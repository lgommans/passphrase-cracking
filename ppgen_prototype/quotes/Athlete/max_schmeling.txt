German,Athlete
Looking back, I'm almost happy I lost that fight. Just imagine if I would have come back to Germany with a victory. I had nothing to do with the Nazis, but they would have given me a medal. After the war I might have been considered a war criminal.
I had a happy marriage and a nice wife. I accomplished everything you can. What more can you want?
