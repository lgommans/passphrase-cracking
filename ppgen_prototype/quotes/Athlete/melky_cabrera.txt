I just like to be under the radar and concentrate and do my job.
I think the one person that has the most influence on me is the Lord.
I've been very happy with all the teams I've played for. They all treated me very well.
When you are 20 years old, you are immature.
My mom is always with me. When I made my major-league debut I told her, 'That's it. You don't work anymore. I'm going to work and take care of you.'
I need my mom for moral support plus to do the house things.
