American,Athlete
After a few games I knew I was going to be able to compete. The idea of being a star never crossed my mind.
I bet I made close to 20 tackles because nobody on either side knew what they were doing.
I can ski out of my back door.
I just wanted to be an athlete.
I probably played hurt a lot more times than I should have.
I was always the last one chosen for football games in Central Park.
I was captain and should have set the example. I would lift a minimum of weights. Mine was natural physical strength. I always thought quickness and agility were much more important.
I've caught fish as big as I am. I've caught marlin close to 300 pounds.
It took me a while to realize that basketball wasn't football.
Most exciting for me was to make the Pro Bowl in 14 of 15 years.
Nobody cared about swimming. You could draw a crowd for basketball.
Our coach was absolutely out of his head. He must have read Bear Bryant's book. We had 78 players out. The first day 35 quit. Twenty quit the second day. We ended with 17 players. It was depressing.
Our whole philosophy was to intimidate the quarterback. We were able to do it. We were pioneers. People still recognize us as, maybe, the best defensive line of all time.
Team doctors' jobs those days were to keep you on the field.
The basketball coach cut me within two days, so I was back in the pool. I was the first one in the wall after the first 25 yards, but the last one out because I didn't have a flip turn.
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.
You are the land. The land is you.
One of life's most painful moments comes when we must admit that we didn't do our homework, that we are not prepared.
