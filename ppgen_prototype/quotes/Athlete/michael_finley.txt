It's always good to go against your friends, especially when you come out victorious.
To be a part of a championship team, I'm excited... This is the closest I've ever been to a championship. I'm looking forward to the challenge of helping this team repeat.
My thing is, I want to play basketball, I would enjoy playing in the D-League, but at the same time I don't want to take an opportunity away from a young guy to get exposure. I'm still thinking about it.
