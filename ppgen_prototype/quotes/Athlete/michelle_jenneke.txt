Australian,Athlete
It's not like I have media out there when I'm training. I'm training the same. I'm putting in the same work.
I think even if I was to go out there and win the Olympics, everyone's still going to remember the pre-race routine that I do and the video that went viral, so, y'know, that's alright for me.
