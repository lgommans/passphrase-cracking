I come from the 49er, where there is a high error rate in the sailing but the best sailor still wins, and that's why I'm attracted to these kind of boats.
Nothing fires me up like losing. It certainly makes you want to go that extra bit.
Capsizes kind of go hand in hand with 49er racing. I've had four to five capsizes in races and still won the event. It's just the nature of this type of sailing.
I've been sailing from the age of 2, and apparently, when I was 4, I told my dad, 'I know how to do this; you don't have to come with me anymore.'
The thing I enjoy about going fast is the risk-reward scenario you get. If you make good decisions, the benefits are amazing. If you get it wrong, you can lose so much.
Someone asked me the other day, 'What is your most memorable moment in your career?' and by far, China was. Being so close - the medal race was one part of the story, and there were a few incidents through the event that amounted to that massive drama at the end that cost us the medal.
The strange thing about the Olympics is that delivering on your potential is always quite difficult.
