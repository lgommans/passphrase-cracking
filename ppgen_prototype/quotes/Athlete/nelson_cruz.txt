I always have high expectations for me.
When you get a chance to get a W, that's the most important thing.
You can watch videos and hit off the tee, stuff like that, but at the same time, it's you against the pitcher. I just need one swing or one pitch to click, and you can find your swing.
There's nothing worse than seeing your teammates battle, knowing you can't help.
