The universe works in crazy ways. Your good luck will come in waves, and so does your bad, so you have to take the good with the bad and press forward.
At training, I consider myself a bit of a morale booster. I take a pack of lollies just to boost the boys' morale. I see that as crucial. I try and be a good influence and keep a high energy.
I reckon you have to put a presence in front of your opponent - a bit of confidence and attitude - and then you can change what their next move may be.
I like to get in the mindset of the honey badger when I go into contact. There's no doubts, no fears. If you can do that as a human, you're killin' it.

I'd love to go to the Olympics. I grew up watching it on TV, and I was always very patriotic and passionate watching that. I'd like to give that back to my country, but I know I can't just walk into the side.

You don't give yourself a nickname unless you're bloody struggling.
Everyone has their own mission in life and what they've got to do. You can't knock them for it. There's always a lot going in people's lives.
