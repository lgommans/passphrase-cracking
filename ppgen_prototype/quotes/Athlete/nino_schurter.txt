I worked hard to complete my medal collection.
I worked hard to get stronger and better, and I'm really happy and satisfied.
I'm just really happy. Really satisfied with my whole medal collection.
It is really a great feeling to win a World Cup on your birthday.
It is good to get the racing closer to the spectators.
Every race is like training and preparation.
I have bronze in Beijing, silver in London, and now gold in Rio. It is the perfect story.
I really like Pietermaritzburg: it is really a course for me - really technical.
