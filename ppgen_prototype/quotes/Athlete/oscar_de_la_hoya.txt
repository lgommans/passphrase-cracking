There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business.
You get to be famous or have some notoriety and there are so many people who want a piece of you.
I think about making a comeback every single day. I went running, I went training, did that for a few days. But my body couldn't handle it.
Everything I have in this world, I owe to the sport of boxing, and I won't ever forget that.
I think my body went through a lot, went through the wringer. In terms of being inside the ring, getting hit, but also outside the ring, living a crazy life.
