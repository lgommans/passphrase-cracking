The celebration... you cannot practice it or anything. It's a moment when the excitement of your goal make you react to the moment.
Obviously, I have a lot of memories here... but at the same time I'm going to put all my energies into moving forward and doing my best for the Thrashers.
My job is to score goals.
I just cannot have an offer on the table and just let it go.
My speed is my greatest asset.
Now I'm kind of different. I'm not saying I lost my spark - I still have it - but I don't chase the goal as much as I used to. I'm playing for the team and I still know I can score, but it's different than two or three years back.
Sometimes that happens. I know how it feels to lose eight or nine to nothing. It can be frustrating but it was good for us. This was a team that was hot the last nine games. It seemed like any puck we touched went our way.
We talked to the referees before the game; there's always new situations to adjust, for the refs and for us as well. Even on the ice, it's good for players to talk and interact with the referee.
We want to learn all the game and play the best way and take to our advantage.
You have to play defense, that's how you win.
Our team has a lot of talent. I hope that soon we will break out with four or five goals and avoid overtime.
This is definitely a playoff team. There's no question about that. It's just a matter of how much we want it.
To me, it's like we're already in the playoffs. Every game is important for our position. We can't relax at all.
We're getting rewarded. We don't give up on the play and we show some character at the same time, but there is a long way for us to get to where we want to be.
