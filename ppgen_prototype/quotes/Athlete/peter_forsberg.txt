It's been a good hockey life for me anyway.
It's always good to get a goal on your first shift, but this was a game it seemed everything was going in.
It's not only hockey, it's every sport. You know, it's a big event.
Well, you have your regular classes, like three hours every other day, three times a week. You get twice a week to have an ice practice. Once a week you have weight lifting. It was great.
We had a great group of guys when I was there, five of us, I think. It's a great competition. Every practice was hard. I think that's helped us a lot, everybody that was there.
I wouldn't accept losing as a team, wouldn't accept losing as my team. It's like a war every practice. I think it helped us a lot.
It's only 60,000. It's not a big town. It's a big hockey town. Everybody plays hockey when you grow up.
Pretty it's pretty good for me because I'm over here in the winters. It's really improved my golf game.
Of course, I'm sour that if (retirement) happens, I didn't get to quit on my own terms.
