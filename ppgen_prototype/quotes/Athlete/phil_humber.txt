God is so good.
I had never seen a perfect game or no-hitter thrown.
Everything that happens to you, I feel like it helps you develop as a person, as a player.
The difference between a home run and a swing-and-a-miss is, what, an inch and a half? You can throw a great pitch, the guy makes a great swing. And if it's at a guy, it's an out. That's the beauty of baseball, really. There's not just one guy in control.
When you have an injury in your forearm, it affects the command of your pitches. I would yank pitches down away, or they were staying up. I'd go to accelerate, but everything would come forward except the ball. The ball was staying behind. When you have an inconsistent release point like that, it's impossible to throw a changeup.
I told my wife that since we have a little one on the way, maybe when he gets old enough, instead of just taking a vacation to the beach or Disney World or something like that, we go and do something that actually has an impact on other people. That would be neat for him to experience and for us to do as a family.
