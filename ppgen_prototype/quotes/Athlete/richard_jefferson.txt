Businessmen... were not born chief executives. They were often people first.
I try to be as efficient as possible.
I'm insanely optimistic. For odd, weird reasons, things always work out.
I want to play for a championship team. I want to win a championship.
If I get an opportunity to play for a championship team, I'm going to go hunting for that. I have no loyalty.
