There's no such thing as lack of confidence. You either have it or you don't.
The time I've spent in professional Premiership club rugby has been invaluable.
Nowadays there are too many players who can't get a contract elsewhere, who come to England and just take the money.
The players must be at the centre of their industry.
You are always going to get extreme views around coaches and players.
