Here in Cameroon, football is our leading political party. It's football alone that that unites us, it's football alone that brings us good things - football is the window into our country - so we don't mess around with it.
If I can join hands with FIFA and other continental bodies to promote football globally, then I can do more than that to raise African football to new heights.
The president requested me to restore order in the national team. I have been designated to be part of the official delegation to Egypt to help boost the morale of our players.
They have very good individual players, but they need the collective game. And they still do not have it although there are now only six months left to go.
It's true I'm more widely recognised now and get invited to take part in all sorts of events and projects but as a person, I haven't changed.
I'm a big salsa fan!
I'm a fantastic dancer!
I only really watch sport. That's where you see real joy. I don't like watching much else on TV, because it's generally either twisted or sad.
Cameroon is stronger because it's a country of conquerors, of winners. Cameroon's players aren't necessarily very technical, but that when they play, they play to win.
Cameroon is a football country - children are born playing football.
On the field, everyone is equal.
You can be a top, top player for 10, 20 years, then you become a coach, lose two or three games and you're out.
Everybody knows everything about all the teams now.
