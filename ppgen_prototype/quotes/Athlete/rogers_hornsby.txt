American,Athlete
People ask me what I do in winter when there's no baseball. I'll tell you what I do. I stare out the window and wait for spring.
I don't want to play golf. When I hit a ball, I want someone else to go chase it.
Any ballplayer that don't sign autographs for little kids ain't an American. He's a communist.
I always tried to hit the ball back through the box because that is the largest unprotected area.
I don't like to sound egotistical, but every time I stepped up to the plate with a bat in my hands, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the pitcher.
I've never been a yes man.
It don't make no difference where I go or what happens, so long as I can play the full nine.
Now the advantage is all with the hitters.
To be a good hitter you've got to do one thing - get a good ball to hit.
