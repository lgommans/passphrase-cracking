Brazilian,Athlete
God created me to delight people with my goals.
When I was born, the man in the sky pointed to me and said, 'That's the guy.'
I pay my own bills. I feel my own pain.
I'm inspired by challenges. My life was always like this.
Officially I'm not playing any more. I've stopped. My time is up. Everything has been a lot of fun.
I'm happy because I won't have to train again, or travel or sit in team hotels.
I'm like any Brazilian: I like to go out and enjoy myself.
The night has always been my friend. When I go out I feel good, then I always score goals.
I like to say it like it is.
I'm genuine and people can believe what I say.
When things are really good, really easy it's not cool for me.
I'll never forget my friends and where I came from.
I defend the Brazilian people.
Will I become a coach in the future? No way. I'd never be able to put up with someone like me.
The tendency of everyone is to evolve.
We Brazilians, happily or unhappily, leave a lot to the last minute.
Strikers are egotists, selfish. We have to be.
I have my way of doing things.
I have scored against every team, every country, every defender in the world.
If someone criticizes me, I strike back.
