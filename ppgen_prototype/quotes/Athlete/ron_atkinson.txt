I've had this sneaking feeling throughout the game that it's there to be won.
I think that was a moment of cool panic there.
Well, either side could win it, or it could be a draw.
He sliced the ball when he had it on a plate.
I'm afraid they've left their legs at home.
He must be lightning slow.
Zero-zero is a big score.
