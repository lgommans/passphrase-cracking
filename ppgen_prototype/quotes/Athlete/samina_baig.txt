I am doing the mountain climbing to empower women.
Mountain climbing is my passion, and to empower women through my expeditions is the reason. I am doing the mountain climbing to empower women.
Mountain climbing is my passion, and to empower women through my expeditions is the reason.
My most cherished desire is to help our women come out of their routine chores and infuse in them the indefatigable spirit of adventure.
Mountaineering is one of the most difficult sports - we are away from routine life for days, living in tents, and it requires high degree of physical and mental strength.
I hope that the families will understand that the contribution of women is important and can be more powerful for building a greater country.
I want to tell women in developing countries that they are as powerful as their male counterparts, and they can play an equal role in their respective societies.
In my community, women are as important as males, and they are playing an equal role in the society.
I was thinking about the women of Pakistan, those who are not allowed to get education, those who are not allowed to do whatever they want to do in their life. I hope that the families will understand that the contribution of women is important and can be more powerful for building a greater country.
Chashkin Sar was virgin, and we climbed it for the first time, and afterwards, the people renamed it as Samina Baig.
People want to come to Pakistan but are not given visas. We wish for visas to be given to those people who want to come to Pakistan.
I say that Pakistanis should not consider girls as weaklings.
Women need opportunity and encouragement. If a girl can climb mountains, she can do anything positive within her field of work.
