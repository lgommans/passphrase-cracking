I became a good pitcher when I stopped trying to make them miss the ball and started trying to make them hit it.
Pitching is the art of instilling fear.
There is among us a far closer relationship than the purely social one of a fraternal organization because we are bound together not only by a single interest but by a common goal. To win. Nothing else matters, and nothing else will do.
I think it's incredible because there were guys like Mays and Mantle and Henry Aaron who were great players for ten years... I only had four or five good years.
I've got a lot of years to live after baseball and I would like to live them with the complete use of my body.
A guy that throws what he intends to throw, that's the definition of a good pitcher.
People who write about spring training not being necessary have never tried to throw a baseball.
Show me a guy who can't pitch inside and I'll show you a loser.
The game has a cleanness. If you do a good job, the numbers say so. You don't have to ask anyone or play politics. You don't have to wait for the reviews.
If there was any magic formula, it was getting to pitch every fourth day.
