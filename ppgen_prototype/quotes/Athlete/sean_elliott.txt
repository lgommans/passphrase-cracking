I'm a prime example of the way kidney disease strikes silently.
I'd like people to know that you can head off kidney disease, maybe prevent a transplant or stop the disease from progressing after detection by doing a simple urine test in the doctor's office.
All the fans being here got my adrenaline going. I definitely got a burst of energy from them.
It's not every day you do something that's never been done before.
I was a healthy young man, and I thought I was invincible before I was diagnosed with kidney disease.
