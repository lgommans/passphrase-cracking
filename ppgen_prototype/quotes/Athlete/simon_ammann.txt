I'm afraid Eddie the Eagle was before my time. All I know is that his glasses were three times thicker than mine, but I can jump three times further than he did.
When I was younger, I did not have the strength to jump well enough, but over the years I have gained that, worked on it. But the sensibility you simply have to have.
