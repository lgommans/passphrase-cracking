I wouldn't throw all spitballs. I'd go maybe two or three innings without throwing a spitter, but I always had them looking for it.
I was never a strikeout pitcher. Why should I throw eight or nine balls to get a man out when I got away with three or four?
I never did like Cleveland. Don't know why. Didn't like the town. Now, the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town.
