Italian,Athlete
I have found serenity at Monaco.
A champion's strength comes from never being contented.
My mother lives with me in Milan, while my father travels to and from Savona. My parents take care of my money, too.
I am tied to my father's land and am happy to visit relatives in Egypt, but I feel Italian and was never remotely tempted when Egypt asked me to play for them.
I am gratified by Arsenal's interest, certainly, but my objective is to come back for Milan and do well at Milan.
I have learned to make a lot of effort and sacrifice for this sport, and now I can say it's paying me back. So it is important to always show determination and effort on the pitch.
I scored my first goal with the national team against France.
I feel a great kinship with my origins, even though I only learned a few words of Arabic.
Competition is normal at a big club, but I've never been worried about it.
I've always loved the club. Kaka was my role model when I was young, and my aim now is to go down in Milan history.
I'm very attached to my roots, but I feel Italian more than anything else.
With time, I'll learn to do more things, different things.
With myself, Mario Balotelli, Robinho, Alessandro Matri, Giampaolo Pazzini, and now Kaka, we will be too strong.
I'm an attacker, and forwards always want to score.
The Egyptian FA have tried to persuade me to play for them, but all I'm dreaming about is the blue jersey.
The goals will come; we just have to think about working ahead of the next game.
