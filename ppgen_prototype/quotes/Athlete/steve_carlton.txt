You've gotta find a way to get out of your own way, so you can progress in life.
That's the past. I don't agree with retrospect.
Rooting is following, and I don't do that, but I'd like to see the Phillies win because I love Philadelphia.
And the irony is that they wrote better without access to my quotes.
It's all quotes, anyway, and it all sounds the same to me.
I took it personal. I got slammed quite a bit.
To pick up the paper and read about yourself getting slammed, that doesn't start your day off right.
I was probably in the best shape of any athlete at the time, but you don't get to pass judgment on yourself.
My major league debut came at old Busch Stadium on Grand Avenue in St. Louis against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Pete Rose came over to the Phillies in '79 and he became the catalyst that helped us to put it all together.
But I would say basically, I would just like to be remembered for what I did on the field.
Everything I was, physically and mentally, that's what I put on that field.
So what I did on the field was the essence of what I am. Remember me like that.
I trained myself to perform on the field.
The final release point for the fastball is the tips of your fingers.
To get the feel of how the slider should roll off of your index finger, use this grip and practice at half speed and roughly half the distance to the mound.
