The sound of the blades on the ice in the morning is like smelling fresh coffee.
The highlight of my career? The Olympics, of course.
Acting is easier than skating in a way and harder in other aspects. In skating, you get one chance, and with acting you get to do it over and over.
I can't even imagine what it's like and right now I'm like in shock, I can't believe that I'm Olympic Champion.
It used to be that I wanted to be taller. Once I made 5-foot-1, I was happy.
Over the years, God and St. Therese have kept me going no matter how bad things were.
