American,Athlete
I wouldn't say I'm lucky, but I do take care of my body. I never drink or smoke, and I get the most out of my body.
Arizona was the best place. I like the competition in baseball, and the football program has been great for the past five years. I think I'll be playing as a freshman in both sports, and I think I can play with them.
Records are made to be broken.
