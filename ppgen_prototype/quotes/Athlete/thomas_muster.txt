Austrian,Athlete
My comeback was not about winning or losing; it was about the feeling of being able to compete at top level again.
I think my family needs me more than anybody else, and tennis doesn't need me anymore. I respect my wife a lot for taking all that in. She said, 'I didn't marry a tennis player; you'd retired.' Now it's time to do something else.
To work a vineyard, you need a lot of guts to do that. To go out there and work all year, you almost feel that these people talk to the grapes. Wine is a lifestyle, and you can talk about it for ages. It's a passion, but it's not something I can do on a daily basis.
Way of life in Australia focuses more on the outdoors.
I've reached most my goals and when my career is over I will have many other things to do.
I was so tired of playing tennis, so tired of traveling, of hotels, everything related to this sport.
