You're always playing the game to reach the ultimate goal.
I think you use the negative things that happen from the year before - and from other years, too - to spur you to do the things you need to do to take the next step.
Well, we can't all be Terry Bradshaw.
It's easy to say you're more mature because all of a sudden you have a child, but it's a process.
I think my best years are ahead of me and that's exciting.
As a competitor and an athlete, you love that you get to go back and challenge someone, especially the world champs.
I'm ready to rock and roll.
I feel like I'm going to be with the Cowboys the rest of my career, definitely. I love it.
It's just like high school. If you're a freshman or a sophomore, it's hard to tell the seniors who've been through two, three, playoff games what to do.
If you get a great wife who understands the demands of someone in athletics, I think that's important.
When you're younger, it's about, 'How can I get better? How can I become the player that I want to be?' As you get older, it's, 'How can this football team improve?' While all along getting better along the way.
The first game of the year is always an in-season adjustment game.
I think as a player there's a sense of urgency every single year that this is the year we're going to have success and do the things we're excited about.
