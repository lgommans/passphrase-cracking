One thing I like about boxing is that I will not have to deal with the same kind of politics that I had to in skating. In boxing, it is not about your appearance, or how your costume looks, what color it is, or how much it costs.
I have never been the stereotypical figure skater.
She hits me and she beats me and she drinks. My mom is an alcoholic.
It's an image that the media has given me as a bad girl, and the only reason they gave me that image is just because of the few things that have gone wrong in my life, and also because I grew up living in a trailer.
I moved around 13 different times before I was in fifth grade, not having money, not having a lot of friends.
My biological mother made my clothes or bought my clothes from Salvation Army or Goodwill.
I was told my whole life, you're fat, you're ugly, you're never going to amount to be anything.
