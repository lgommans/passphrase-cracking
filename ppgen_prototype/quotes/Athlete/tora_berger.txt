Norwegian,Athlete
I started competing in cross-country when I was seven years old.
When I was about 18, I started to think that I could have a long sporting career.
I started to practise shooting more seriously, more than once a week. I wasn't very good at it before, but I got a lot better. I've also become a little bit stronger on the tracks, too, which has increased my chances of success.
