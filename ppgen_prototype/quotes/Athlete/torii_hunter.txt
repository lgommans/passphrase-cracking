Sometimes I get so pumped up, I get a headache. I get woozy. I get dizzy. I like that feeling, I don't know why.
I tell kids to have dreams, have goals, and believe in them because if you have any doubt, worry or fear, it will choke the life out of your dreams and goals.
A lot of kids are broken, and it's hard for them to believe in anything. But you have to have an imaginative mind and tell yourself, 'Hey, I can do whatever I want to.'
I'm like the Shaolin monk, the counselor in the clubhouse.
My grandmother was the type of woman who always smiled and said, 'Treat people like you want to be treated, and life is so much easier.' My mom is the same way.
Nothing in baseball can bring me down to the level where I was growing up in Pine Bluff, crying and broke. This is fun for me. Whenever you see me slumping, nah, I don't get upset; I'm all right.
When you do what you're supposed to do and don't complain much, I think the fans, media, players and front office appreciate and respect that.
