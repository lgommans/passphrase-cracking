American,Athlete
To meet my goals, I couldn't let up when I was playing tennis.
Venus hasn't been to the semis for a couple of years in a Grand Slam - she's been coming back from injury.
The prize money for first place was $2,800, but I didn't take it because I was still an amateur.
We've gotta give Richard Williams a lot of credit - to give us two number one champions is a phenomenal feat.
Mary Joe Fernandez rarely has a bad loss. She never tries for stupid shots.
Pam has always been my glamorous big sister - 13 years older than I. She played on the women's circuit for nine years and came home to tell me stories of France, Japan.
When I was 11, I won my first nationals at Savannah, defeating Kelly Henry in the finals.
I won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title in 1980.
My mom and dad met at UCLA when he as a captain in the Air Force and she was in her junior year.
I began playing in the Pacific Coast Indoor Tennis Championships.
I didn't want to just rally at the baseline, even though that happened a lot.
My mind started wandering. I started playing carefully, instead of playing the way that had gotten me to that point. I had to force myself to keep driving the ball.
My brother Jeff is now my agent at Advantage International in Washington, D.C.
I was planning to remain an amateur for a while.
My sister and I are opposites in many ways. She is six feet tall, while I'm five feet four.
Winning that first game was so important; my mother always said that the first game of the second set was the chance to keep it going if you were ahead or change things if you were behind.
From one match to the next, I kept on winning.
I started tennis around age 2.
