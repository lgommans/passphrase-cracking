It's been a roller-coaster ride. But I haven't been diving this well for a while.
I used to hurt myself by training all the time.
When I take a break for a week, it takes me three weeks to get back to where I was.
Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow. I'm just going to enjoy it.
Whatever that day has given, you have to make it the best of the best. That's one thing I've learned over my years. On days when you can't make everything what you want, do what you do best, make it as positive as possible, and go from there. Learn from your mistakes.
Let's put it this way: The animal inside of me has not quieted down yet. It's still there. It's still fighting.
Instead of doing thousands of dives, I am focusing on quality, and I'm listening to my body more.
I still have a dream.
You don't get old until you replace dreams with regrets.
Pools have their own uniqueness, design and engineering to depict culture, history or innovation.
You can't make up for something you lost.
As an athlete, when you have a desire and a want to do something, you fight for it. And it doesn't matter how long your journey is; it's whether you give up or don't.
You only get so much time to do something that you enjoy or love to do. If you can continue doing it, you might as well, because I don't want to live in regret. I don't want to be the person sitting behind a desk, wondering, 'Did I do it right, did I finish it off, did I really give it my all?'
Ultimately if the body is in tune, most likely the mind is in tune.
I like to try to hit all of my dives.
My mom worked for a doctor who had a pool that he heated to 90 degrees, and I hated cold water. My dad showed me how to dive in that pool, and pretty soon I started doing flips.
My goal is to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games, and I'll fight and continue going until I do that.
