I was missing out on a lot of things that my friends were doing, but in another way, they were missing things I was doing. It was kind of a trade-off I had to make.
There are so many steps you have to go through to reach a high level, so you're kind of building your own, I would say, mountain. You have to go piece by piece by piece. When you're young and really ambitious, you want to jump right up. It kind of teaches you a lesson, I would say.
I just want to have fun.
I don't really care how I sound.
I'll never be like a Barbie girl, that's for sure.
You cannot be in pretend for people to like you.
I'm always honest.
I like to go shopping, to the movies, all the girl stuff. Just a normal girl.
My grandmother is the person who inspires me the most.
I feel like when the task is more difficult for me it's more exciting.
I always take things step by step and match by match.
I love New York. It's one of my favorite cities.
You know, I think I'm the worst player to talk to about statistics.
I'm not a big fan of watching my matches.
Things are never perfect, so I never get too high about things, or get too down about things anymore.
I have learned how to better handle things as they come.
I love the game and I am so lucky to be able to do what I love.
