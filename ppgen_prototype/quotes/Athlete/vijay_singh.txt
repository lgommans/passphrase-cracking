Maybe I should write 'Tiger Who?' on my cap.
He started pushing to make birdies and you don't do that when you're down.
I'm playing pretty good now, but my ranking doesn't say that. I'm number two.
I hope she misses the cut. She doesn't belong here.
It doesn't much concern me if Tiger plays in the tournament or no.
In my heart I know what kind of person I am, and that's good enough.
If I can hit the ball the way I want to hit it on the range, I'd rather do that than play golf. I just love the feeling of hitting good golf shots.
Golf is about knowledge, and studying another player - more than listening to a teacher - is the best way to get it.
The way you play, you need to talk about winning. Don't talk about keeping your card - talk about winning.
