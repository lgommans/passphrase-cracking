Of course managers win ball games.
The toughest thing about managing is knowing your personnel and what it can give you under all conditions.
I've won plenty of games by knowing when to take out my pitcher; whom to replace him with; or how to place my infield or outfield to defend properly against the opposing hitter.
I always liked Casey Stengel as a manager because he seemed to have a grasp of so many things.
I put myself through college playing pool.
I'm not afraid to learn from my coaches.
I do worry about tomorrow's game, but never about next year's job.
