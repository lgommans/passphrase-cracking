Just because I'm undersized and under-this and under-that, I've still been a good football player since I was little.
When I'm answering questions from the Denver media, I'm not worried about what the Broncos' people are going to think. I'm worried about what Belichick will think. Isn't that crazy?
I grew up playing soccer and always loved playing it.
I think the older you get, the more you realize how important life is, the more you think about your family.
I can't say Boston is 'home-home.' It's definitely a place I'm growing accustomed to. It's such a great sports town.
You always think you're one of those players who will be in one place the whole time, one of those guys they'll never let leave because you play hurt, do what it takes. But it's a different age. A lot of coaches, they like having younger guys.
When I first came into the league, I was with Tim Dwight in San Diego, and a guy named Eric Parker, who really showed me the work ethic it takes to be an NFL receiver, and I've really tried to keep that with me.
To tell you the truth, I thought I would be returning kicks and punts my whole career. I thought that was going to be my deal, and I was fine with that.
I go out there with whatever the coaches call, and whatever they do, I just go out there, and I'm the player. Coaches coach, and players play.
I take really good care of myself, and I make sure that my body's in tip-top condition, and I stay on top of everything - eat right and do everything else to make sure that I can play for a long time.
Basically, I really like to train. That's what keeps me busy during the offseason - just training and getting my body right and getting ready for the next year.
