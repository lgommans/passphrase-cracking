We have only God on our side; they have 'In God We Trust' on their side.
I feel more comfortable with the ball in my hands, playing the point guard. But I like playing the 2, too. I think I bring tough defense and the ability to score and also get my teammates the ball to score.
Thanks to all the fans from Detroit and Philly who are recognizing what type of player I am, and I hope they keep supporting the Sixers.
