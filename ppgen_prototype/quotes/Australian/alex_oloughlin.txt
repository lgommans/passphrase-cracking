I really enjoy doing charity, for a good cause, it's like the least I can do, I really enjoy that stuff. I enjoy giving back.
My trumpeting sounds like a goose farting in the fog.
It is such a cut throat industry where you get knocked down so much and get rejected so much. If you do not back yourself up, no one else is going to so you really need to learn to get up, shake the sand off your chest and keep going.
Losing my anonymity in this world I think is something that I find terrifying.
I write music just for me. I'm certainly not good enough to do it on any kind of a level but I enjoy that time because it's quiet.
I do not think I'm a great talent. I think I'm a medium talent, but I think I understand the business and enjoy the business.
I do have a stunt double because there are certain things that they won't let me do. Like they won't set fire to me. They won't like let me jump off a 20 story building. There are certain big stunts that it's just impossible to get insurance to let me do, but for the most part I'd say I do probably 75% of my stuff.
It's nice having your work recognized but having people follow you around is kinda weird.
I like playing the villain.
I am a big fan of vampires. I've always been obsessed with the genre, and the beautiful romanticism and erotic kind of nature of the immortal being, the undead who lives on human blood.
The mecca of filmmaking in the world just so happens to be in America. It's quite simply a case of us just going where the work is.
I don't know what I'm really good at. I'm really good at sittin' by the pool. I have to work at that. I'm really bad at auditioning.
I'm the son of an everyman. My father is a teacher. He teaches physics at a boys' school in Sydney.
