Australian,Politician
No government, no organisation, no citizen can afford to be less than vigilant in combating bigotry, intolerance and hatred. And frankly, our way of life depends on that vigilance.
I have this view that losing weight is easy, keeping it off is hard because keeping it off is the discipline.
If you've stacked on the weight over time, and if you don't have any health issues, you don't realise. So you'll see yourself in the mirror and, yes, you know what the scales say, but you don't actually see what other people see.
I don't favour ethics classes being an alternative to special religious education classes.
In commendably seeking to protect freedom of speech, we must not lower our defences against the evil of racial and religious intolerance.
Bigotry should never be sanctioned, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
Vilification on the grounds of race or religion is always wrong. There's no place for inciting hatred within our Australia society.
