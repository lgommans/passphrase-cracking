Australian,Actor
Most of life is routine - dull and grubby, but routine is the momentum that keeps a man going. If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street.

I've done a little bit of TV. I'm doing a little mini-series at the moment called 'Scooter.'
Most people are nice and just want to have a chat.
If I could work with any actor it would have to be Johnny Depp. He is cool.
It's very hard to play a hyperactive character all the time, I try my best, but I end up collapsing at the end of the day.
I have mainly come from a theatre background, I did 'Oliver' here I played the Artful Dodger and I did 'The Sound of Music.'
My first scene was a streaking scene, I had to streak at a footy game, that's how I get introduced.
