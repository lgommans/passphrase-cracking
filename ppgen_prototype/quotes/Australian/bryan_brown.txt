Australian,Actor
I simply went down there to catch up with an old mate of mine, who owns the place. He's the one who wrote the book on the place, but no, no movie, just a beer.
We are always going to be influenced by America... I watched the word 'bum' go out and 'butt' come in. And part of me says, oh that's a shame, but Aussie boys are still Aussie boys.
When you live in a place, you're not just taking from it, you're contributing to it. In America I would never be able to make myself a person who could contribute. I wasn't interested in that society; I was interested in this society.
Because I like theatre and I love a challenge. With 'ZEBRA!' I've found a new Australian play where I can create a character first - that's what I live to do.
Look, I've always been a confident bloke. I'm grateful to my mother for that.
I'm a Sydney suburban boy shaped entirely by the western suburbs.
You know, I stumble about what I'm going to do. I don't plan. I've never had ambitions.
I wanted to be an actor, and when that day happened that was sort of like the end. Now let it take me.
It costs a lot of money to release a movie. What you'd call art-house movies - movies that don't have big stars or big budgets - they're very hard for distributors to get behind 'em and take chances.
