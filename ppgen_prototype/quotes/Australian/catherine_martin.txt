I am sufficiently wary of dangerous situations, but I'm not scared of having a go.
When you're surrounded by feathers and sequins and ridiculous Lycra outfits, it's impossible not to have a smile on your face.
If you go to old houses on Long Island you will see painted Chinese wallpaper, which was big in the 18th century. Throughout history, notable, established families have always tried to link to the 18th century.
Constance Spry was one of the first people to put flowers in urns and ceramic swans and other unusual containers, but her arrangements tended to be a little less full.
I'm interested in clothes in the way that other people are interested in cars.
I wish I could swap closets with Diana Vreeland, but I think only my left thigh would fit into her clothing.
My workspace is a white room with a big computer monitor and a light box. It can be very messy. Sometimes I get into trouble with my husband for that. Then I run around like a lunatic cleaning up and creating the appearance of order.
I love every period in design history. Even the ugly ones.
I doubt I'll ever retire, but if I do, I see myself as the little old Parisian lady pushing her trolley from the supermarket to her apartment. Everyone needs a pipe dream.
I always look forward to going for a walk in Rushcutters Bay Park, right down to the bottom where you can look in the clear water of the harbour. I use that time to clear my head and really focus my thoughts.
My children's favourite thing is to con me into buying them ice-cream if there's not too big a queue at our local gelataria, Messina.
