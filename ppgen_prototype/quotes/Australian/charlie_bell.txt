Australian,Businessman
We're not perfect, but we want to do the right thing.
Australians are pretty blunt and we say things how they really are.
The biggest threat to McDonald's lies within - and that is us as a company becoming complacent. There are a lot of companies that get fat, dumb and happy and take their eye off the ball and forget about serving customers.
There are good days and there are bad days, and I've had my share of both.
I was getting old, man. I was staring 27 in the face.
Life is not a rehearsal.
The problem with naming a No. 2 is you really want to throw all your weight behind the guy who is going to be the leader.
Someone once said that life is what happens while we are making other plans. I now know what that means.
Many of the criticisms about McDonald's are false. We are keen to provide people with as much nutritional information as possible to help them manage their diets.
It would be arrogant of us for me to say everything at McDonald's is perfect.
My philosophy in all my jobs at McDonald's is to be honest and say what I think and mean what I say.
