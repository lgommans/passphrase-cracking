As expanding economies continue to grow, the one source of energy that we can develop rapidly, cheaply and with next-to-no emissions is nuclear energy.
There was a lot of stress and assumptions made without me even saying anything, which was very upsetting.
We didn't talk about the decision at all, which was great, just to get together as friends. The only thing he said to me was 'It's your decision. Just do what you have to do and I will back you 100 per cent.
The decision I've made has come from my heart. That's me, to follow my heart.
When assumptions were made that I was going to bail out there was a little part of my brain that thought 'I am going to do to prove them wrong'. In the end that wouldn't be coming from my heart and doing what was right.
No matter what policy initiatives we take on, we are going to need a permanent repository for nuclear fuel based on the law and sound science.
