I never, absolutely never, keep people waiting.
I emphasise the following: don't, whatever happens, be anyone but yourself. Don't act anyone else-that would be fatal.
There are no limits, love, there are no limits.
You know this old style of American family series? Well, I sit there and cry.
You didn't want to laugh, did you? It wasn't very funny, was it?
I'd rather you didn't talk, but it's up to you.
Many people think I'm a television personality. I never have been! Just someone who acts it.
When my mother died, I had to go on air that night and do jokes.
I terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and went upstairs to lunch.
Don't get too close, it hurts.
