I hope, for my generation and for children at high school aspiring to be rugby players, that they will hear the name Speight and associate it with rugby more than anything else.
The more time you can spend in sevens, the better. Time is invaluable; there's no substitute for that.
I dreamt of playing at the World Cup one day, but I never dreamt of playing for Australia. So it's a massive honour to be here and to be part of this team and to represent this country. So for the kids back in Fiji, if they dream big, there are no limits to what they can achieve.
Personally, just being able to compete in an Olympics, being part of an Opening Ceremony wearing a green jacket with the rest of the Australian Olympic team, would be a more than a dream come true.
Obviously growing up, the ultimate dream is to play for Fiji. When I was growing up, everyone wanted to play for Fiji on the biggest stage, which is Hong Kong Sevens, and then the other events on the HSBC Series. So I guess the biggest moment I can have is to play against Fiji: my homeland.
There are certain people who aren't with me any more, but they're with me in spirit. I just want to do them proud and live up to expectations that they had.
