Australian,Musician
When people say to me 'what do you think of rap music?' my answer is there's no such thing. There's rap and there's music.
People refer to me as 'that 'Love Boat' man.'
I find great beauty in songs with a creative interpretation, but most people generally don't get that, and go for the simple songs, but I prefer something a bit more complicated, which is more meaningful to the creator.
Because I'm shy and a bit quiet, I think people assume I'm an elegant person.
I particularly like Hershey's chocolate - the kind which has almonds in it.
I was always one of those fortunate people who never wanted to be anything other than a singer and an actor. Most people know me as a singer, but I am also an actor.
My grandfather was from Aberdare. He was a coal miner who emigrated and then continued mining in Pennsylvania.
I was born into a world where a lot of people who came to the house were performers.
I'm not even allowed to sing in the shower at home. Too loud.
If someone had told me when I was a kid I'd get an ovation from Frank Sinatra! One time, I did a song called 'I Am A Singer', but I rewrote the words for Frank. I was in tears and, when he got up, so was he.
