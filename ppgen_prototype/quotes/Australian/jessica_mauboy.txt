I've always looked up to Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey for their outstanding vocal performances. I've always been inspired by them.
I have a black pair of suede Jimmy Choos. I've only worn them once to a Sony event. The heels have these arrow plates in a pattern. There's gold, black and white and they're amazing!
My father is Indonesian Timorese, my mother Aboriginal Australian.
I just want to play music with a band, live.
When I get into the studio, it's not about trying to get a good song, it's about whatever comes naturally.
I've always been a big fan of Mariah Carey. I think it's her personality. As much as she has an amazing voice, she has a crazy personality and I love the fact that she's not afraid to hide that.
