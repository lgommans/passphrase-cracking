The liberal entertainment industry is a fickle world. So it's about living in the moment, and it's about being clear with it and understanding that this is another opportunity to step up the staircase a little bit and create some newer opportunities and get involved in some other projects, as well as possibly creating your own.
Something great about 'The Last Ship' is that it employs a lot of actors, and a lot of actors are getting work because of it, and all these people are in here, and all these artists are working together.
There's a slew of actors that I'd love to work with. I'd love to work with Gary Oldman. He seems like not only a solid dude and a good man, but a pretty inspired actor.
