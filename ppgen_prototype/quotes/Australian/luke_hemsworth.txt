Australian,Actor
I've seen sharks in the ocean, it hasn't made me get out of the ocean; that's for sure.
My head is massive. My head is, like, off the charts.
I don't think most people decide to become an actor because they want to be followed around all the time... I see it when I'm with my brothers, and I don't get it. I don't understand why someone wants to take a photo of us getting out of a car or on the beach. I think that's really weird.
I could probably live in London if you had better surf.
