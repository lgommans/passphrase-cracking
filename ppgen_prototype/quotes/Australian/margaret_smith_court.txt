Australian,Athlete
My femininity is always something I've tried to preserve in this dog-eat-dog world.
I pastor a very large church in western Australia. We have about - over 2,000 people, which we have a Bible school, community services, a lot of things linked with it. So my life's very full today. Not enough days in the week.
