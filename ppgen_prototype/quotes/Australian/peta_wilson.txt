Australian,Actress
I was scared of the dark. Ohhhh, I'd do anything not to have to sleep on my own. I'd get in bed and cover myself with dolls and teddy bears.
I never say no.
I'm actually quite conservative.
I'm crazy about my father, he's an amazing man, a real adventurer. He took us with him to travel all over the world. We were in places that were so remote, that white people hardly ever reach them.
If you're going to be sexy in a photo, you'd better be thinking about sex rather than about being sexy.
I've made a lot of grown men cry with laughter, because I really am quite the joke.
I'm the Magoo of actresses, very accident-prone.
I personally prefer being a blonde, but whatever it takes for the character.
You can shave my head if you need to; it doesn't bother me.
I don't buy fur coats or jewelry. I have old cars.
