Australian,Coach
It's a disappointment to lose key players. On the other hand it creates an opportunity to play other players.
I remember Simon O'Donnell being struck with cancer during Australia's 1987 World Cup campaign. I know very well what it is like to have a teammate who has been struck with a potentially fatal disease. He fought through: managed to get himself back to 100% fitness and back to playing again.
My memories of Australian cricket are it was an environment of good fun.
