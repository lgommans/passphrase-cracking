Australian,Actor
My hair and my accent are sort of my main assets.
I don't know that many Australian actors in Los Angeles, but there are a few of us. I mean, we kind of get together occasionally, but I wouldn't say it's an alliance or anything like that.
In Australia, getting an audition can be a rarity. There just aren't as many opportunities.
Everyone brings their own particular skill set to the job, and acting training can work for a lot of actors, and it can't. I've seen a lot of really good actors go into acting schools and then come out a little bit corrupted.
I studied Shakespeare all through high school. Both of my parents teach English and history, so it has always been around my experience as a young man.
