When I was to come to Washington the first time as Music Director of the Boston Symphony, Mrs. Johnson phoned us to find out if they could give us a party and who we would like to meet.
When I was introduced to Johnson he was a freshman Congressman.
The President would usually talk to me about matters relating to the immigration problem.
The Congressman ascertained that the consulate in Havana had numbers to feed the pigs.
I was sent down to Cuba. Everything had been prepared with the help of Congressman Johnson and his staff.
I was introduced to Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson. The young Congressman was very friendly.
A President doesn't have a terribly long time to talk to people who are not really on the agenda.
