Austrian,Artist
When I was young, I was clever enough to know that if I got married or had children, I would be eaten.
I do remember when it occurred to me the first time, when I got the idea of painting the way I feel at a given moment. I was sitting in a chair and felt it pressing against me. I still have the drawings where I depicted the sensation of sitting.
I possess a strong sense of reason.
