Vienna is the gate to Eastern Europe.
This aircraft tops everything. All the others look old as compared to this one.
The alliance with air Berlin is attractive for me. I can use the whole sales network of the air Berlin and 24 percent of my own airline at air Berlin sold.
Running an airline is a normal job. Racing is more.
I want to bring passengers on my airplanes to present to them my product.
We now fly with an airbus, which has 210 seats, six times the week to Palma to the spider of the air Berlin.
The guest gets at least as much service with us as with some established airline, if not even more. And at by far a favourable price. Thus the passengers remain gladly with us.
The crucial point is always the own cost structure. Therefore I created a Low Cost alliance with air Berlin.
In Germany air became generally accepted Berlin in this area. It operated with 45 airplanes within the Low Cost range from Germany, and is one the most successful carriers in Europe.
I employ 20 people in Vienna. The other 130 coworkers are pilots and flight companions. The Overhead is limited with me. Reduces naturally the costs of my fliers.
I always go extreme ways.
Giving up is something a Lauda doesn't do.
Airlines go in the long run at the competition to reason. For the passenger the competition is good, because each competitor tries to undercut the other one.
