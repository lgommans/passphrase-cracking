American,Author
I worked as an actor for many years. Then I segued to some non-fiction writing.
I love being a writer. I don't really want to do anything else!
I don't think I'd like to be a different person. But I do sometimes see my cats lolling about and think it would be nice to be one of them.
I went to high school in Stockton, CA.
