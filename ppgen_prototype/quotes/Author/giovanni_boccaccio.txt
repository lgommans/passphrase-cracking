Heaven would indeed be heaven if lovers were there permitted as much enjoyment as they had experienced on earth.
Human it is to have compassion on the unhappy.
Do as we say, and not as we do.
While farmers generally allow one rooster for ten hens, ten men are scarcely sufficient to service one woman.
People tend to believe the bad rather than the good.
