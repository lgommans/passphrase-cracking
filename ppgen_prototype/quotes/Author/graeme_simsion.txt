I worked in information technology and academia for a long time and met many people who were better with things and ideas than with people.
I set out to write a screenplay but, since my early 20s, had dreamed of writing a novel.
All of us have to make some accommodations and allowances if we are to live with another person.
Fortunately, I am accustomed to creating amusement inadvertently.
I feel I've done the 10,000 hours you have to do to get good at something.
A lot of romantic comedies are just light romantic dramas, or the comedy comes off second-best.
I am happy that I'm a better novelist than a screenwriter.
Interestingly for me, modern rom coms have not always been funny - many of the iconic rom coms are more like light dramas with occasional comedic moments, often coming from secondary character.
I am a big advocate of the role of the bookstore in the community.
There's definitely a role for online booksellers, but they can't host events, bring people together, and form a personal relationship in the way a bricks-and-mortar store and its staff can.
