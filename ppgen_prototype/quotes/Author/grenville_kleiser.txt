Good humor is a tonic for mind and body. It is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. It is a business asset. It attracts and keeps friends. It lightens human burdens. It is the direct route to serenity and contentment.
By constant self-discipline and self-control you can develop greatness of character.
To every problem there is already a solution whether you know it or not.
Periods of wholesome laziness, after days of energetic effort, will wonderfully tone up the mind and body.
You can develop good judgement as you do the muscles of your body - by judicious, daily exercise.
It is often better to have a great deal of harm happen to one than a little; a great deal may rouse you to remove what a little will only accustom you to endure.
