Danish,Author
Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.
Where words fail, music speaks.
Travelling expands the mind rarely.
My life is a lovely story, happy and full of incident.
Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale.
Every man's life is a fairy tale written by God's fingers.
Being born in a duck yard does not matter, if only you are hatched from a swan's egg.
Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with short steps.
