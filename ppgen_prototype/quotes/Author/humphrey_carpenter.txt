Autobiography is probably the most respectable form of lying.
The nice thing about being a writer is that you can make magic happen without learning tricks.
I can write, He floated up to the ceiling, and a baby rabbit came out of his pocket, grew wings, and flew away. And you will believe that it really happened. That's magic, isn't it?
