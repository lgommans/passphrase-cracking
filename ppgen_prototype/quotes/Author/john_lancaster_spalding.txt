The doubt of an earnest, thoughtful, patient and laborious mind is worthy of respect. In such doubt may be found indeed more faith than in half the creeds.
As memory may be a paradise from which we cannot be driven, it may also be a hell from which we cannot escape.
We are more disturbed by a calamity which threatens us than by one which has befallen us.
