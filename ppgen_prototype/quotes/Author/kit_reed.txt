I should probably confess that I get bored easily, which explains my reluctance to work with formula, tropes, whatever.
I dream in color; it's always a movie and sometimes I'm in it, as myself.
I have to believe everything I write is brand new and I'm writing in this way about these people in a completely new situation for the very first time.
I've lived on a military base and in a convent boarding school with dobermans at the bottom of front stairs to keep us in and intruders out, and in college I spent some time at the Naval Academy, where everything was run by the numbers.
I realized that both the military and religious orders depend on discipline to shape people - which routine does, in a lot of ways.
