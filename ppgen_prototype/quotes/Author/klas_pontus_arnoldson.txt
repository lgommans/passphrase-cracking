Swedish,Author
Without peace, there is no freedom, individual or national. War and hostilities are a form of slavery.
Man's nature is fundamentally good, or perhaps it is neither good nor evil. In any case, man is something to work on. We must hold fast to this fact - man is something to work on.
Without peace, there is nothing truly human. Peace is harmony. And harmony is the highest ideal of life.
