Kids are smart. Knowledge is power. Let them figure things out. Don't turn into that grown-up who they won't come to.
I know I seem really friendly, but I'm a closet introvert.
Give your kid some credit for being smart - just because they read about something doesn't mean they will do it.
Being an author of banned books is cool, I've decided.
Ideas matter. The world matters. Our lives matter, and the choices we make as we navigate our lives perhaps matter most of all.
I don't shy from controversy. I'm telling stories, and I'll tell whatever story seems like it wants to be told.
What I find cool about being a banned author is this: I'm writing books that evoke a reaction, books that, if dropped in a lake, go down not with a whimper but a splash.
Sometimes I worry I'm writing 'Fifty Shades of Grey' for teenagers, but I'm not.
God, it sucks to disappoint your parents, even at forty-two years old.
I understand why parents worry about books - they're worried about their kids. They want to keep their kids safe. But parents aren't always realistic.
When guys talk about sex, eyebrows don't get raised. It's different for girls.
I'm always drawn to the underdogs, to the people whose stories don't get told.
It's neither my job nor within my capabilities to save people. But a book sure can try.
Every time I write a new book, I want to push myself to try something different.
Whatever you hold onto that you want to do, and that other people tell you you are foolish to want to do - don't give up.
Kids need to see their world reflected back to them.
