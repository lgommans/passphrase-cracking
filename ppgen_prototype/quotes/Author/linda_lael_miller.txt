No matter how well a person writes, a successful book is a team effort involving many, many people.
I've loved all my books, but I will admit that 'The Man from Stone Creek' holds a very special place in my heart.
I was once a single mother, with very few resources, so I have a special place in my heart for women in difficult situations.
'Big Sky Mountain' is the story of Hutch Carmody and Kendra Shepherd, lovers with a history, and a lot of hurt pride. The book is about finding their way back to each other, growing as people, and inventing a life they can share.
I love writing Christmas stories, especially of the historical variety.
I think we all like to get away from our troubles and worries with a good book.
I'm awake as soon as the sun crests the eastern hills. I guess I'm motivated because I love just about everything about my life - the writing, the many critters, the art, and all the rest.
I've written since I was 10 years old, so I guess I'm self-taught. I've had some luck along the way, I must admit, and I've worked hard.
