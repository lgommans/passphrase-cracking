I do not write often now - not for want of something to say, but from a loathing of all I see and hear. Why dwell upon it?
She died praying that she might die.
I am always on the women's side.
I do not allow myself vain regrets or foreboding.

I think this journal will be disadvantageous for me, for I spend my time now like a spider spinning my own entrails.
