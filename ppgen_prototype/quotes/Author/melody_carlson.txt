American,Author
A book is kind of like a river; I simply jump in and start swimming.
I don't usually think of my writing as a 'challenge' because I enjoy the process so much. I suppose that's what's helped me to avoid 'writer's block' all these years.
I grew up in a difficult environment, but I became a Christian as a teen. My mom and my sister soon became Christians also.
