There are a lot of queers starved for entertainment from their own community.
I think it's my job to make any question interesting by coming up with a jazzy answer, otherwise I hardly deserve the spotlight, right?
There is a huge difference between writing a book, which is a private activity I engage in with myself, and wanting to engage in overly intimate personal conversations with strangers, which I pretty much never want to do.
Lots of my writing can be accurately called lesbian, but I myself am queer and date people of all genders.
Of course it is very limiting to be labeled a lesbian or queer writer. We live in a homophobic culture, and even people who aren't hateful per se assume they won't get anything from a queer book.
I'm never not going to be interested in young girls who are struggling in poor places.
