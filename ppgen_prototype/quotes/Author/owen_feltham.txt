Negligence is the rust of the soul, that corrodes through all her best resolves.
Meditation is the soul's perspective glass.
Zeal without humanity is like a ship without a rudder, liable to be stranded at any moment.
Perfection is immutable. But for things imperfect, change is the way to perfect them.
There is no belittling worse than to over praise a man.
There is no one subsists by himself alone.
