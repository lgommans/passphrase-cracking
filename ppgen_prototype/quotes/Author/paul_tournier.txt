Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.
Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets.
Acceptance of one's life has nothing to do with resignation; it does not mean running away from the struggle. On the contrary, it means accepting it as it comes, with all the handicaps of heredity, of suffering, of psychological complexes and injustices.
The more refined and subtle our minds, the more vulnerable they are.
Let us not seek to bring religion to others, but let us endeavor to live it ourselves.
Recounting of a life story, a mind thinking aloud leads one inevitably to the consideration of problems which are no longer psychological but spiritual.
At the heart of personality is the need to feel a sense of being lovable without having to qualify for that acceptance.
