As long as I could remember, I had looked forward to a handful of wonderful events - a total eclipse of the sun, the return of Halley's Comet, and the first trip to the Moon. I've still never seen that eclipse, and Halley's comet was a disappointment, but my sense of wonder was diamond-bright on that July 20, 1969.
I have a very sardonic view of life.
I follow only one rule in my writing, and that is to be interesting. If the story is interesting to you, the writer, then it will probably be interesting to somebody else.
