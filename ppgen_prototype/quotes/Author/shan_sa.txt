French,Author
I would like to be a philosopher in ancient Athens and a poet in ancient China.
I talk to trees and animals. We have interesting conversations about food, weather, and love. They sometimes can predict the future.
Politicians are better liars than writers.
I have written too much about lives - I feel I have lived for too long.
