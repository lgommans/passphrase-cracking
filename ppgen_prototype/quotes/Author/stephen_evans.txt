There is only one dream I can guarantee... my death.
I don't mourn the dead. I mourn the living.
Although we will both die, and life is utterly meaningless, my time is vastly more important than yours.
I know all human beings will be successful. How do I know? They all die.
Treat Death as it treats us: with utter indifference.
What is the value of your existence?
I'd rather be dead than dying.
Death is the welcome cessation of idiocy.
