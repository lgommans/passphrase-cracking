American,Author
I had finished the first draft of 'Life As We Knew It' before Katrina hit, and it was startling to see things I wrote about actually happening in the real world.
A lot of my YA novels are about family problems.
What interests me more than dramatic heroics are the domestic things: How do people do laundry and find food when the world is about to end?
I live about 60 miles northwest of New York City, and whenever there's news of a big snowstorm coming, everyone runs for the store. The perishable items are usually the first things to go, which doesn't make sense because they perish.
