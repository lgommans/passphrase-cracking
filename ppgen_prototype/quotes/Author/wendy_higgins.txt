I tend to lean toward romance, characters, and relationships when I write, so I have to add to the setting elements and world-building when I revise.
I gather inspiration from all aspects of my life and things I see: love, heartache, mistakes, hopes, regrets, successes and faith. And it helps to have a wild imagination.
I love the ultimate escapism of paranormal and fantasy - all of the otherworldly creatures, magic, and possibilities that transport both reader and writer away from reality for a while - it's such delicious fun!
I rely heavily on my beta readers' honest critiques.
