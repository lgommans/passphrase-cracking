It comes with faith, for with complete faith there is no fear of what faces you in life or death.
I have found adventure in flying, in world travel, in business, and even close at hand... Adventure is a state of mind - and spirit.
Capacity never lacks opportunity. It cannot remain undiscovered because it is sought by too many anxious to use it.
I might have been born in a hovel but I am determined to travel with the wind and the stars.
To live without risk for me would be tantamount to death.
