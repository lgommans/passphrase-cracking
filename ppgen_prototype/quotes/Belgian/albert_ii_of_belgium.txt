Belgian,Royalty
But if our hopes are betrayed, if we are forced to resist the invasion of our soil, and to defend our threatened homes, this duty, however hard it may be, will find us armed and resolved upon the greatest sacrifices.
In these troubled times we live in, we should remain vigilant and see through populist arguments.
One single vision fills all minds: that of our independence endangered. One single duty imposes itself upon our wills: the duty of stubborn resistance.
Belgium is modernizing itself and it gives me joy.
The crisis of the 1930s and the populist reactions of that time must not be forgotten.
Prince Philippe is well prepared to succeed me.
Queen Paola and I will never forget the ties that have grown between the people and us during the course of the years. Thank you for your confidence, tokens of sympathy and support, sometimes even with a little criticism. We always loved you.
