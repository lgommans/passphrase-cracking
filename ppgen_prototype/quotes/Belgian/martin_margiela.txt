Each time somebody working for the Maison has a baby, the atelier creates miniature blouses-blanches, exactly like the ones we wear, with the child's name embroidered across the front. That is our welcome-to-this-world gift.
While working as a team, you push yourself forward and move outside the boundaries. It's a great thing.
