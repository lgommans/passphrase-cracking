Brazilian,Model
Modelling's not something I want to do just on its own, but I always want it to be a part of my life.
I think it's good to do your own thing and want to be different, and not look like everyone else.
When I'm drumming, I'm not thinking about much.
My brother and my dad always used to shave their hair, and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I do the same?'
When I was little, I was such a tomboy - I loved a baggy T-shirt and leggings.
I was always into punk, ever since I was 13, but I was into other stuff, too - like, well, the Spice Girls. I really liked Scary Spice.
I wish I was more into clothes. I don't know the current designers.
My style is part of the music I like, the bands I see, the people I surround myself with, the places I go to.
I can understand when people copy people of the past and make the future their own.
I would have never thought that I'd be doing Chanel.
I like to be comfortable. And I think men tend to dress more comfortably than ladies. They can just put on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, and I like doing that. Comfort first.
When I was growing up, my mother always wore Chanel.
I love '90s grunge and punk.
Some photographers work on the same image for hours and hours and then use the first picture that they took.
I like bags that are easy to wear and are pretty to look at. But I don't like them when they have no space and you can't put anything in them.
If you're not having fun with your job, it will show.
You adapt your look to places you live, where you are and what you are doing.
