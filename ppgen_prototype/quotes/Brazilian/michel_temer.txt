Brazilian,Politician
A president shouldn't tell the judiciary what to do.
Let's stop talking about crisis. Let's work instead.
I've heard, 'Temer is very fragile, poor little thing; he doesn't know how to govern.' Gibberish!
Our government is concerned about the future. Everything we do today is not aimed at tomorrow but rather at a future that preserves the living conditions of Brazilians.
When you have a new government assume power, everyone, without exception, has to work for the benefit of the common good.
The climate issue is for the state. It is an obligation for all governments.
My first word for the people of Brazil is the word 'confidence.' Confidence in the values that form the character of our people, the vitality of our democracy.
My father always said that Brazil is the place to 'make America,' and by 'make America' he meant the place to grow - to prosper.
Impeachment is allowed under Brazil's Constitution.
It's necessary to give birth to hope again.
Every time there's an institutional issue like impeachment, there's concern from the outside about what will happen.
I realize I lack popular recognition.
I don't need to make political gestures or take steps to get re-elected.
Here in Brazil, the president and the vice president are elected together.
I have confidence in the responsibility of those who occupy a seat in the legislature.
