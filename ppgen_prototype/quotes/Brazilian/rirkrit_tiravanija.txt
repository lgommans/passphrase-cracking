Brazilian,Artist
I am a socialist, so I am not worried about socialism. I am worried about dictators who are putting everyone into a socialist state for their own benefit.
I am always rethinking how art is perceived and received, questioning our relationship to art. That's always been a constant.
I'm ephemeral as much as I can be, so I started to think about the idea of not working. It's really about a change of attitude. It's not so much about stopping, but about re-thinking the meaning of one's production.
I guess I've always been quite interested in the Situationists' ideas about urbanism and spectacle and how we move through life.
One gets wrapped up in reacting to one's own reputation, which can be a kind of trap.
When I visit new places, I like to see the markets.
