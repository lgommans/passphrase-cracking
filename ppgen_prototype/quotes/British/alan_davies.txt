The thing I'd really like to see is the old London Bridge, with all the old buildings around it like Shakespeare's Globe. I'd like to walk along that. Don't worry, I won't get drunk and fall in.
I see myself as a comic but the acting helps sell tickets for gigs.
There's a lot to do when you're a kid - spiders to catch, girls to poke in the eye - stuff to be getting on with.
I'm not a great shopper but I do buy a lot of books. I'm the publishers' friend - I buy a hundred books a year and read four.
My favourite restaurant is the Thai Corner Cafe on St Paul's Road. We go there all the time. I shouldn't really mention it - I don't want it to be chock-a-block.
I like pubs too, but it's hard for me to go and get proper bladdered in the way I used to. I don't want to moan about being recognised but I do get a bit of grief sometimes.
The one I remember is going into London, as it was for us in Essex, on New Year's Eve in 1981. There were four of us and we'd had a few lagers on the way. One of my mates threw up in the Tube and then stood up and fell over in it. We thought it was the funniest thing we'd ever seen.
I don't drive around London much. Any journey around Islington involves hundreds of speed bumps that seem to tear the bottom of your car off.
The principle that light can be in two places at the same time is absolutely extraordinary.
I'm quite a curious person. I don't mind being the one who doesn't know things, a role I often play in QI.
I liked the idea of all of humanity fitting inside a sugar cube because more than 99.9% of matter is space.
I'm more inclined to linger in the science pages of 'The Week' magazine. But my principle obsessions are still watching sitcoms and football.
I was hugely disappointed that 'Whites' was cancelled.
