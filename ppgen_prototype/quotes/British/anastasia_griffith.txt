I don't think we really think about where we get our equality from. There is a sense of feminism and women become passe, in my opinion.
No human being in history was all good or all bad, or all black or all white.
I feel like you can do all the research in the world, but when you start putting that costume on, put your hair in a wig and walk into those sets, that's where the visceral reaction is. It's no longer in the head. It's in the body.
Nothing we do is ever going unnoticed. It's on CCTV cameras, it's on iphones, it's everywhere.
The girls in 'Downton Abbey' do what they do so well, which is make it so natural despite the fact that you're living within these constraints and taking so much from the research aspect of it.
