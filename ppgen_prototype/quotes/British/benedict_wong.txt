British,Actor
Customer freedom! Don't dictate how I want to watch my TV!
I'm in the loners' society. I don't want to classify myself as anything.
It's really hard because obviously people label you as a British East Asian actor. And I'm just from Salford; it's where I was born.
In America, you're just an American. You're accepted. It doesn't matter that you're of whatever race. If anything, I'm British, and that's it. So let's just get on with it, really.
In terms of representation, television is reflecting an era that has passed. It's the wrong time; it's the wrong period. In all sorts of television, it doesn't feel like the 21st century.

Occasionally, when you do a take, and - what I kind of sort of like is asking for a PPB - Personal Play Back.
Khan let Polo be his eyes and ears. He was the first one to build a bridge between East and West.
I feel like we are reintroducing historical figures, with the explorer Marco Polo and the grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, the ruler of the Mongol empire, the trading place that everybody wanted to get involved in.
Kublai noticed this uncommon perception that Marco Polo has, with the idea to explain and talk about his country so vividly that he can see it.
Bruce Lee has always been a hero of mine, and the choreography in 'Enter The Dragon' is amazing.
Ridley Scott is a cinematic master and a great man. It was a real honour working with him on 'Prometheus.'
We watched a lot of Hong Kong action movies in my house when I was growing up.
In Kazahkstan, you would drive five hours outside the city to where roads sort of stop being roads, and it was just in the mountains and deathly quiet. And you could only really hear the clumping of the horses, and it was a sort of a beautiful silence. Like it enveloped you.
