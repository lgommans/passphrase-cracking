Success can create more madness than happiness.
And you realise you're doing a public service in making people happy - as a musician you can give people something a doctor, a lawyer, a politician cannot give them that. It's not scientific. It's spiritual - a good feeling. And although you don't know them personally, the audience are like your friends.
Suddenly life has new meaning to me, there's beauty up above and things we never take notice of, you wake up suddenly you're in love.
When you're older and wiser a lot of the ego has gone out of the window.
My first instrument was a little blue ukele.
