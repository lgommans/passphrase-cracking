At a young age, it is hard to be different from the crowd. I want to encourage young girls that it is cool to be different. Young women should be pleased they have something unique and make the most of their talent.
When I started windsurfing, it was a hobby, and I enjoyed the lifestyle. Then it became an Olympic dream. Now I've achieved that with a medal. I just feel so lucky.
I was very self-conscious about my body from a young age. At school, I played football and netball and did ballet as well so was very athletic. I wasn't curvaceous; I had muscles on my arms and shoulders. Often I felt like hiding them rather than showing them off, as I felt they were masculine.
Bigger girls go faster in the wind; lighter girls go better in the calm. Around 57kg is the ideal weight for women in my windsurfing class.
One of my strengths is my explosive power. Especially at the start line, where you have to accelerate faster than your competitor. I train for that by lifting barbells. It helps your hips thrust and your muscles twitch faster, and it builds strength. But I don't do too much gym work because I don't want to bulk up.
I hate my arms. If I wear a nice dress, I can't go strapless or sleeveless because my arms just aren't feminine.
Windsurfers are fitter than sailors. We're so much more kinetic. In some boats, you can literally sit there and smoke your pipe - it's much more civilised!
