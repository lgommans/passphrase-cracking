I'm spreading my wings at last.
I love my girlfriend to bits. I'd never do anything to hurt her.
I was fine with everything except Maths. I was terrible at Maths.
There were a few 6th form girls that I got with when I was I the 6th form, they were really nice, so that was cool.
The Busted thing happened when I was 16. I saw an opportunity, took it and it was better than being at school. It was a fun job but I'd never claim Busted was anything other than a pop band.
I'm incredibly proud of everything that we've achieved in Busted. We've enjoyed some of the best times in our lives together.
It was a fun job but I'd never claim Busted was anything other than a pop band.
Busted is not the ideal band I'd like to be in by any stretch of the imagination.
Lots of people say to me, 'I completely hate Busted'. That's completely cool with me. I understand why.
I understand how hard rock fans feel inside out, because I was one of those people.
I wanted to play music. I didn't think about where it would go or what it would do.
I started to hate fame, I didn't want to go out, because I didn't want to be recognised for what I was being recognised for.
I've got so many musical personalities, I could probably get treatment for it.
I've lived my career backwards - I started off huge and I've got smaller and more personal, and I'm much more comfortable now.
I wouldn't go back and change anything.
I've taken my destiny into my own hands and I'm in a happy place.
My life now could not be better.
I'm living my dream.
Pop is in a shocking state at the moment.
Really young kids are into guitars.
