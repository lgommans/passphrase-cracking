The best thing about being a DJ is making people happy. There is nothing like seeing people get up from a table to dance or the expression on their face when they hear a song they love. I also love to educate people on music they have never heard.
I was too young to ever have fun in the '90s, so I'm always trying to relive what I wasn't a part of.
I think my style is quite grungy and punky. I love the '90s and the music from that time, and I love punk music. I'm also a fan of mixing vintage with some high fashion, which links back to my musical taste because I tend to mix old music with newer songs.
Sleep is the real beauty secret, but I don't get enough of that.
I think sleep is just the most important thing. I think most New Yorkers, especially, don't get enough sleep.
I never dress appropriately in terms of comfort, but I wear what I'm feeling. I often to like to feel a little different from everyone else.
If I'm DJing a show, I will normally wear the designer I'm DJing for; if I'm DJing a party, I will most likely be wearing very high heels.
I'm a big cat person. It's one of those things that's like, everybody that knows me thinks it's so weirdly apparent and obvious.
I am so grateful, without sounding cheesy, to have such amazing friends with me and to have a career that's going so well.
I love vintage shopping in flea markets, vintage stores and even Ebay.
Wear an unusual accessory to complete your outfit.
FKA Twigs is stunning. She has beautiful contemporary and unique sound with an almost psychedelic vibe. Her music is great for the runway.
I'm not a big Beyonce girl, but I love Rihanna.
The coolest party I've ever D.J.ed would have to be for the artist Damien Hirst. It was an amazing party in Berlin. I had such a great time, and people danced all night long.
