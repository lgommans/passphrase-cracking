British,Actor
I love playing really strung out characters, and characters that are really pushed to their limits and losing their mind.
As an actor, what you dream of is being able to portray people that people empathize with and understand and really feel for.
I spent a long time in London on the stage, and you knew exactly what you were going to be doing. You not only knew the performance, but you also knew exactly where you would stand.
I love playing really strung out characters, and characters that are really pushed to their limits and losing their mind. I think that's wonderful. To be able to lose it, in many ways, is just great fun to do.
