British,Cartoonist
Here lies a nuisance dedicated to sanity.
Making a cartoon occupied usually about three full days, two spent in labour and one in removing the appearance of labour.
Some critics of my work took the view that a satirist should defer to the finer feelings of his readers and respect widely held beliefs.
Churchill was one of the few men I have met who even in the flesh give me the impression of genius. George Bernard Shaw is another. It is amusing to know that each thinks the other is overrated.
