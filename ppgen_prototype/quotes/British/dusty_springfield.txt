I wouldn't know how to handle serenity if somebody handed it to me on a plate.
I'm the most misunderstood, misquoted person I know, honestly.
It's marvellous to be popular, but foolish to think it will last.
A lot of people say I'm bent, and I've heard it so many times that I've almost learned to accept it.
My sexuality has never been a problem to me but I think it has been for other people.
I find it an effort to keep up appearances.
I'd love to retouch my whole life.
My affections are easily swayed and I can be very unfaithful.
I have tried sex with both men and women. I found I liked it.
Hell, have I been a hell-raiser!
I was a nothing kid. Not particularly good. Not particularly bad.
Somehow I took whatever criticism there was very much to heart.
Sometimes you have to let people down in order to get on, particularly in showbusiness.
I just decided I wanted to become someone else... So I became someone else.
