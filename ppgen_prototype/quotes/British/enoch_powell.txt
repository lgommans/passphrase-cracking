British,Politician
If my ship sails from sight, it doesn't mean my journey ends, it simply means the river bends.
I do not keep a diary. Never have. To write a diary every day is like returning to one's own vomit.
No battle is worth fighting except the last one.
History is littered with wars which everybody knew would never happen.
To write a diary every day is like returning to one's own vomit.
When I repress my emotion my stomach keeps score.
If I cannot understand my friend's silence, I will never get to understand his words.
I will not surrender responsibility for my life and my actions.
