British,Actress
Relatives cannot help you in the studios. You stand or fall by your own efforts.
I would sooner play in a good British picture than in the majority of American pictures I have seen.
It is sensible to have a safeguard against unemployment.
You see, money isn't everything - I know it sounds corny but I really mean it - success means a lot more.
