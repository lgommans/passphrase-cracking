British,Businessman
Few there are that will endure a true friend.
Every dog is a lion at home.
He who knows himself best esteems himself least.
Courage ought to have eyes as well as arms.
Violence in the voice is often only the death rattle of reason in the throat.
He preacheth patience that never knew pain.
He that ceaseth to be a friend never was a good one.
Friends are like fiddle strings; they must not be screwed too tight.
