I always considered programming as being like modern-day wizardry. You could think of things in your mind and then make them happen.
PlayStation consolidated the second wave of gaming. There was a slack period before it came when nothing much was happening.
The distance between the people who made the games and the people playing them wasn't that big. It was the spirit of independence. The programmers were a lot like you.
Compunet was fantastic. You could upload these little demos of what you'd been working on, and it was a really nice social scene - years before the Internet.
Once you get over the hurdle of how to get something on the screen, it's not that difficult to make apps and share them with your friends.
