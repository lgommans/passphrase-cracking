British,Musician
When it comes to girl bands, we're all rivals.
I may be known as the girl who was sunbathing topless with a Prince but Jordan is known as that thick girl who always falls out of clubs drunk. I know which one I prefer.
I have the most amazing support network around me.
Being a mum changed me for the better.
I love being a mum but I do love to work too.
I feel like my mum is in heaven sharing a cup of tea with Lady Fate and plotting my life out like a chess game.
