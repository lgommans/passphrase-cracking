It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities.
The Government are very keen on amassing statistics - they collect them, add them, raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and prepare wonderful diagrams.
But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit.
Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin.
The individual source of the statistics may easily be the weakest link.
The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing.
