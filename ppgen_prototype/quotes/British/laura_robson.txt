There's a puppy store near where I live. They know me by name in there because I go so often.
If I don't play well, then it's not the end of the world, because we all learn in tennis that there's always next week.
Getting pummelled is better than not playing anything at all.
I don't just want to be someone who hits the ball 100 per cent every time. You can play with freedom and still mix up the pace, mix up the spins and everything like that. That's what I want to be doing, because you get into that very one-dimensional kind of tennis if you don't work on slicing and coming into the net.
If there is noise against you, then you try to make it seem it is for you. You just have to try to focus on your own game and try and win the match whatever way you can.
I don't remember my first race, but I do recall various school sports days where I became way too competitive. We were seven or eight years old, and I had a very stern conversation with my relay team-mates about how crucial it was for us to win.
I played my first match aged six. Neither my opponent nor I knew how to score, so our parents had to help us out from the sidelines.
I generally don't use an iPod for track work, as I'm focusing on heart rate and times. When I'm in the gym or running alone, there's always music. If I'm in the weights gym, I usually go for rap or rock music; for running, it's dance or cheesy pop.
I think there are so many phenomenal runners. I grew up watching Cathy Freeman, Kelly Holmes, and Michael Johnson, so I'd say they are my favourites.
