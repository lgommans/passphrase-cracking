I try to be kind to people, to treat them with respect. And I'm proud of that.
My perfect girl would be pretty mad, but one you can have a conversation with. No one can be too mad for me, the madder the better. I love a crazy chick!
There is something really mysterious about lions. They could rip you apart if they wanted to, but at the same time they look so cuddly. Can you imagine what humans look like to animals? They must think we're so weird.
I've learnt a lot over the years, but I'm still quite outspoken. And no matter how much media training you put me through, I don't think I could be anything but.
I haven't shaved my private parts, but I dyed them once for a laugh! They looked more ginger, though!
I still have imaginary friends who I talk to in my head.
We know there's no use in getting miserable, so we go out on the town instead!
I have a rude thought every three seconds!
I think about dying a lot, every time I fall asleep on a train or a plane I expect to wake up to a crash!
To be honest everything goes over my head a bit.
I'm an expert at kissing girls necks, they love it. Girls say I'm quite sensitive, but I'm hyperactive too.
If I fancy a girl, I'll tell her. I'll say: 'You're fit.'
I was brought up with psychics and tarot cards. My mum was always told I was going to be in a boy band and be famous as a singer.
When I was 6, I saw a commercial that Jessica Simpson was in, and that was the first time I felt my little heart flutter.
