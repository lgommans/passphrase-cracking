British,Driver
I don't aspire to be like other drivers - I aspire to be unique in my own way.
You just need to be accepted for who you are and be proud of who you are and that is what I'm trying to do.
What people tend to forget is the journey that I had getting to Formula One. There were plenty of years where I had to learn about losing and having bad races.
I'm an extremist so I'm either hated or loved. I think it's down to when I first got to Formula One not always knowing what I was saying, saying things that mean one thing but people were taking the other way and then people don't forget.
When I think about greatness I just know Ayrton Senna. He was great.
I love it in the States. The roads are big, the food is big. If it was possible to be in L.A. and still live my racing life, I would move now.
I enjoy trying to develop a car and Mercedes are one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world.
