British,Celebrity
I knew I was coming home, I thought they would consider acquittal, I was disappointed that they didn't.
The support in Britain made a big difference.
I don't think I can answer questions about the trust fund.
I would like to go to University and be like a normal 20 year old.
In time the truth will come out, I will be cleared.
I said all along I would not sell my story. I don't think it would be right.
