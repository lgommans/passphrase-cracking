British,Politician
Any MP has to have a proper family life; they have to have support of their partner.
I may have been stupid, but I've done nothing wrong.
I have spent my whole life trying to prove that women can get into politics. I'd now say to them, 'For God's sake don't do it - you'll get slaughtered.'
