British,Director
I think it would be impossible if you had a name like mine not to get a little flack for it.
When people approach me about my films it is usually to tell me how much they hate them.
I'm a fan of music from all over the world.
I still enjoy watching films more than making them.
When you start being enthusiastic about whatever it is you like, that is the golden age for you.
There's still a 1950s view of cinema, that there's one audience and they all want to see the same thing.
If you do a story about a British journalist rescuing a child from Sarajevo, then Sarajevo just becomes an exotic location, and the story's about this British journalist.
I prefer to watch people.
