One of the things I enjoy most about writing historical romance is researching inspiring backgrounds and settings.
I consider myself hugely privileged to work at such a wonderful place as Ashdown, where I can step back into history and be inspired by both the setting and the people associated with it.
Anna Campbell and I have already done a history tour of parts of the U.K., and it would be fun to invite my fellow Word Wench Cara Elliott along, too!
When I started writing, I didn't have the common sense to use a pseudonym, so I write under my own name. If I did have a pen name, though, it would be something very historical - something that sounds very sort of Regency... Sophia something.
My husband is very proud of me and what I do. Which I think is really sweet.
I find writing really hard, but then, every author I know finds writing really hard work.
