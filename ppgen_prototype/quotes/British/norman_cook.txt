British,Musician
I think English people were a lot better at breakdancing than they were at making records.
They couldn't do a drugs story on me because I'd already done one on myself.
I'm very superstitious... I never shout at magpies, walk under ladders or put my shoes on the table.
Most people don't get a fair crack of the whip.
On top of the horror of separating from your wife, you have to go through it in public.
I make music for the hips, not the head.
I try to make people smile and dance, not think about things or educate them.
