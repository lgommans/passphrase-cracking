A prophet or an achiever must never mind an occasional absurdity, it is an occupational risk.
Anyone who knows how difficult it is to keep a secret among three men - particularly if they are married - knows how absurd is the idea of a worldwide secret conspiracy consciously controlling all mankind by its financial power; in real, clear analysis.
There are periods in history when change is necessary, and other periods when it is better to keep everything for the time as it is. The art of life is to be in the rhythm of your age.
Great men of action... never mind on occasion being ridiculous; in a sense it is part of their job, and at times they all are.
