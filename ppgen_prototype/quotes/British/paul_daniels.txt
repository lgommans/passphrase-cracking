You'll like this, not a lot, but you'll like it.
Even though the vast majority of my work was outside television, the amount of creation and inventing that went into the TV shows was non stop and, unknown to me, a great strain.
I don't particularly have any magical ambitions, but then, I never did. I just enjoyed the game.
I am still working on patter and presentation.
I don't get many hecklers now but answering them is an art form in itself.
When people say to me don't the years go fast I have to be honest and say that whereas I don't realise where they go in the long term, I pack so much into a year it seems to take forever.
