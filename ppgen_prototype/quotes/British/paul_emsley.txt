I'm always worried about the sitter - are they cold, are they hot, are they comfortable? Photography today is so accurate and so good that it's really so much easier just to take photographs and work from them.
As an artist, you do understand you're never going to please everybody.
Critics have a job to do. I understand that. It's not just to criticize. They're trying to interpret art for the public.
