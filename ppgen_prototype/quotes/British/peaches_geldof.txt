British,Journalist
I want to be a good wife, a good mother, a good person.
A lot of paparazzi wanted to be real photographers but they failed, and they did that instead, and it's not right; it's stalking.
I hate ridiculous names; my weird name has haunted me all my life.
I hate being called spoilt. My life is ordinary.
I remember the day my mother died, and it's still hard to talk about it. I just blocked it out.
I didn't start grieving for my mother properly until I was maybe 16.
You know what I'm intrigued by? Like, space and wormholes and Stephen Hawking's theories and Richard Dawkins's theories. That's what I care about.
Broadsheets can be scathing. But I have respect for broadsheet journalists because they haven't succumbed to degrading themselves, to writing pidgin English with all these terrible colloquialisms, the phrasing of which is just, like, embarrassing.
You're required to be outspoken in journalism, and in television you're exposed anyway, because everyone watches it.
I don't feel like I need to be a successor to my mother, or her work.
