British,Businessman
It's all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family.
Good, bad or indifferent, if you are not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind.
People are always going to go shopping. A lot of our effort is just: 'How do we make the retail experience a great one?'
You've got to love what you do to really make things happen.
I am brave, but I take a view. It is an educated view. I am careful. I am not reckless.
I think I pick more winners than losers.
I could have closed down bits of British Home Stores to make more money but it's not my style. I want to make my money as a retailer, not by putting people out of work.
You are forced to have the best data capture, the best information, when you have goods in hundreds of factories around the world, and the question is: 'Where is everything?' And how do you bring it all together?
I'm in the retail business, not the circus business.
I don't like department stores. I had a chain of department stores back in 1994 which was Lewis's and Owen Owen, only for a short time, and I found department stores personally difficult.
They already know all about brands... but what 16- and 17-year-olds won't necessarily have is experience of the world of work. The more that businesses get involved with schools, the better, because businesses sometimes complain that students don't have what they require to succeed in work.
