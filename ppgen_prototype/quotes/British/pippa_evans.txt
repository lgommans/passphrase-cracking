I don't know if I was funny as a child, though I always thought my parents really enjoyed listening to me sing.
Health food shops can make people feel very important; it's like a brand new religion with people trying to convert you to quinoa.
I told the ambulance men the wrong blood type for my ex, so he knows what rejection feels like.
A problem shared is attention gained.
I was a precocious child.
The strangest thing about writing a sitcom, is never knowing if it will become anything but words on a page.
I knew 'Be Our Guest' would be performed on a set and in costume, but anyone with a history in Theatre In Education will know that can mean anything.
If you had of told me age 10 that in 19 years time I would be on a stage in Salford performing with Les Dennis in a sitcom I had written, I would have believed you.
You get very comfortable doing the open mic circuit, turning up to the same places and playing to 20 people. In that situation, it won't matter if you aren't great on that night because no one will really remember who you are. Then suddenly you are doing rooms to 400 people and you have to up your game.
Until I was about 14, I was a fat boy, or at least I looked like a fat boy. I think that being funny was a bit of a defence mechanism for me, so I ended up being a bit of a joker.
