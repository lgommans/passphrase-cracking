British,Royalty
The Queen is the only person who can put on a tiara with one hand, while walking down stairs.
When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one.
I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast.
I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend. Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.
I have as much privacy as a goldfish in a bowl.
I'm the heir apparent to the heir presumptive.
My children are not royal; they just happen to have the Queen for their aunt.
I have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life.
I am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who constantly prayed for my happiness.
