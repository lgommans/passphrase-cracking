British,Athlete
I wanted to be Gene Kelly. Well really, I just wanted to dance with Cyd Charisse.
Production was what I always wanted to do, even when I was skating. I'm a bit of a sponge. When I was going around competing I was always asking, 'What does that light do?' If you want to be successful, you have to understand what people are doing around you.
Skating is now retro and hip.
I have always wanted to be on Broadway, whether on ice or on the boards.
Advise for anybody - enjoy what you are doing, enjoy the process of learning and don't be impatient.
Ice dance should not be seen as a rigid conformist form of figure skating. There is a great deal of freedom and originality to be had.
Skating everywhere is unpredictable, no amount of money or facilities is going to create a skating star. You have to have a skater who is dedicated, passionate, and willing to learn.
