I love unique things that not everyone has. I believe its all about how you wear an outfit, not how much it costs or where it's from. Elegance is the key.
I put things in perspective and trust that everything is in its right place, be grateful that I'm healthy. Then throw on a cap and some killer red lipstick and gloss, that always seems to do the trick.
I was always interested in law at school; it was a great outlet to argue but not make anyone angry!
I make sure that I laugh as much as possible, as its the best exercise, and if I'm really feeling the need to do some exercise, I'll go out with my best girls and dance the night away.
My hair is very fine, so I use Tigi Bed Head Small Talk before I blow dry for volume, and I'm a firm believer in Tigi Rockaholic dry shampoo to keep volume throughout the day.
I cleanse, tone and moisturize twice a day. I exfoliate once a week and carry makeup wipes in the car for freshening up.
It's one of the main things that I love about my job. You are never playing yourself, so I really love that I get to be someone else, play a different character and take on that persona, but I also have to take on their qualifications.
Most of the roles that I go for are Americans, so the first thing I had to do was pin down the American accent - which is obviously in 'Blue Crush 2.'
I live a fantastic life; I have fantastic friends - I stay out of the Hollywood stuff as much as I can because it's so much fun that you don't want to go down that path; you just want to work.
TV is like high school because you go into these series, and the people that work there have been doing it for seven years, like 'One Tree Hill,' so you are going into what is already a family - if you are accepted by that family, then it's fantastic fun.
