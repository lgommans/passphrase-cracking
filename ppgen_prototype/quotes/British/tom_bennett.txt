Chris Guest is the godfather of improvisational comedy.
I have the sort of temperament where I try not to over think things, I don't get flustered and I don't panic. I'm not overly neurotic.
My dad has done a bit of research on our family tree, and we can trace it quite far back. My dad believes he has traced us back to being a great-great-great-great-great-great cousin of Wellington.
I think any decent comedy worth its salt has to have heart, otherwise it's just a bunch of jokes. I think people enjoy comedies that have a heart and soul to them.
