British,Actor
The film business is absurd. Stars don't last very long. It's much more interesting to be a proper actor.
There just doesn't seem to be a market for something with aspiration anymore.
I never did anything about my stardom, it never meant anything to me.
I don't want to peak too early. The worry is that you never know until it's all over whether you peaked at all - and then you're finished and it's too late.
