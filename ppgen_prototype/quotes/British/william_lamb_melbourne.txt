British,Politician
It is safest to take the unpopular side in the first instance. Transit from the unpopular is easy... but from the popular to the unpopular is so steep and rugged that it is impossible to maintain it.
Neither man nor woman can be worth anything until they have discovered that they are fools.
What I want is men who will support me when I am in the wrong.
