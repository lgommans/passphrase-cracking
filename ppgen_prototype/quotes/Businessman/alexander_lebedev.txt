Russian,Businessman
It is not polite for a Russian to interfere in British politics.
I don't believe in democracy by bayonet.
I am not aspiring to be a senior bureaucrat. It would limit my freedom.
I am probably the biggest equity investor in the history of modern Russia.
I never planned to be rich, frankly speaking. I was more interested in being free, and doing things. And money helps. But otherwise I was never that interested in it.
