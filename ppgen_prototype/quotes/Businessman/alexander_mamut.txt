Russian,Businessman
People tend to see power carried out by conspiracy. It's easy to believe in.
You can't do business without money, of course, because that's how it works, but I'm not in business only for money.
I can't imagine that life can be replaced with a computer universe. I can't accept it.
I think that writing texts, publishing texts, selling texts in a physical book store is one of the important tools for breeding this new generation.
