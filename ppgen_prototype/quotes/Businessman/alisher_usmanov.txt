Businessman
I have been very fortunate to be successful in business, and I believe that it is right that people who have this type of wealth should give something back into society.
It is my dream to have a controlling stake of Arsenal.
I am a former sabre fencer and fenced as part of the Uzbek republic team.
It is well documented that I am a lifelong football fan. My love of the British game started with the 1966 World Cup.
My home is in Moscow and I have no plans to change this.
It was always a challenge for me to prove that a Russian financial investor can be as successful in the West as back at home in Russia.
Making money from money is like aerobatics.
