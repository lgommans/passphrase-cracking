It gives you great pleasure to know that millions of developers, day to day, make their living using the software that you created.
I felt there was a need for us to build a new programming language. I also had come to see that Microsoft functions best when it controls its own destiny.
I love working with smart people and being challenged. I also like working on stuff that's relevant. That's my adrenaline shot.
Metaprograms are programs that manipulate themselves or other programs as data.
I have no people reporting to me and don't expect to. My competency is in the tech realm.
I work day-to-day on C# and .Net and work at home two days a week so I can do deep thinking, writing and reflecting.
