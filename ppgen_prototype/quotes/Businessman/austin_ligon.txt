American,Businessman
The Obama administration took rapid and decisive action to restructure GM and Chrysler. Within a fairly short period of time these companies were working effectively again.
Private-equity and hedge-fund guys typically come into a situation of mediocrity, where rapid change may result in a profit.

President Obama has shown he has the vision to support average consumers and taxpayers.
