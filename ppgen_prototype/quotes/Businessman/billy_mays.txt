Hi, Billy Mays here for...
The best things in life are free - and $19.95.
When I'm up against a wall, that's when Billy Mays performs best.
I don't take on a product unless I believe in it. I use everything that I sell.
Broken! Busted! Everybody has something to repair. Before buying new, let Mighty Putty fix it for you.
Before you throw it away, let Mighty Mendit save the day.
Long live your laundry!
You know what, rip me off once, shame on me. But twice? I'm coming after you and taking back what's mine.
Life's a pitch, then you buy.
It's a funny business. I kind of compare it to baseball. I'm always looking for a home run.
My voice, my likeness is my livelihood. That's it. I keep it simple. I pick good products.
Just had a close call landing in Tampa. The tires blew out upon landing.
Is it demonstratable? Does it have that wow factor? Is it easy to use? Is it priced right?
I'm a pitchman, my business comes from the pitch, nothing else.
I enjoy what I do. I think it shows.
One of the things that we hope to do with 'Pitchmen' is to give people an appreciation of what we do.
It's important for me to sell a product that works.
I love beautiful wood.
I've done well for myself.
The infomercial business has been good to me.
Stuck in the plane on the runway. You can always count on US Air.
