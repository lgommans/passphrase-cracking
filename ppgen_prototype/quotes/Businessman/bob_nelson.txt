Businessman
An employee's motivation is a direct result of the sum of interactions with his or her manager.
Take time to appreciate employees and they will reciprocate in a thousand ways.
You get the best effort from others not by lighting a fire beneath them, but by building a fire within.
People may take a job for more money, but they often leave it for more recognition.
Communicate, communicate, and then communicate some more.
Take your work seriously and yourself lightly.
You can't command people to do their best; they can only command that of themselves.
It is always easier - and usually far more effective - to focus on changing your behavior than on changing the behavior of others.
An open-door policy doesn't do much for a closed mind.
Just the act of listening means more than you can imagine to most employees.
You get what you reward. Be clear about what you want to get and systematically reward it.
