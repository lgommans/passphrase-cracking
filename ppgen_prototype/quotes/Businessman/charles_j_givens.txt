The more specific and measurable your goal, the more quickly you will be able to identify, locate, create, and implement the use of the necessary resources for its achievement.
Success requires first expending ten units of effort to produce one unit of results. Your momentum will then produce ten units of results with each unit of effort.
To design the future effectively, you must first let go of your past.
Achieve success in any area of life by identifying the optimum strategies and repeating them until they become habits.
Use the losses and failures of the past as a reason for action, not inaction.
