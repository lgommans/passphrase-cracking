Engineering is a fantastic base for any career.
What you learn at university is a good discipline but has little relevance to a real job.
So, what genetic disposition do you need to be a CFO? Essentially, you need to be miserable, you need to be the sort of person who takes drinks away from people at the end of a party.
My day, normally speaking, is: I go the gym in the morning, I go and work for 10 or 12 hours, I have dinner, I go to sleep.
I've always found diversity more interesting than specialisation. I like mixing it up across years, within days, within weeks - that's what stimulates me, gives me energy.
I don't have a tolerance for long meetings. I generally expect to get things over with quickly.
I don't sit down and relax very much. I don't desire to.
I switch on and off very easily; I'm inherently lucky in that sense. I sleep well.
Each of my career decisions has been very much about doing what I wanted to achieve in the role and then finding another challenge.
