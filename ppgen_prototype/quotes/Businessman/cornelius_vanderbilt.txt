American,Businessman
You have undertaken to cheat me. I won't sue you, for the law is too slow. I'll ruin you.
I don't care half so much about making money as I do about making my point, and coming out ahead.
It is not according to my mode of doing things, to bring a suit against a man that I have the power in my own hands to punish.
I have been insane on the subject of moneymaking all my life.
I have always served the public to the best of my ability. Why? Because, like every other man, it is to my interest to do so.
What do I care about law? Ain't I got the power?
There is no friendship in trade.
I am not afraid of my enemies, but by God, you must look out when you get among your friends.
If I had learned education I would not have had time to learn anything else.
