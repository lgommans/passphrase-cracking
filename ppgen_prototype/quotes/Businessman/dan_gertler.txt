Everyone wants quick deals. They don't want to invest.
If there is the right opportunity for us to have a big oil play in Congo or somewhere else, we will definitely go for it.
That is what we know how to do better than anyone else: We know how to maximize value for our projects. If the government would like to hire my services to maximize value for their stake, they should approach me. No problem.
I took a decision that I wanted to be a long-term player in Congo.
At the end of the day, yes, I'm looking to create a lot of wealth.
Our deals and performance speak for themselves. And whoever doesn't feel comfortable investing with us will not.
Everyone comes with dreams and illusions and promises. Everyone wants quick deals. They don't want to invest.
If the government would like to hire my services to maximize value for their stake, they should approach me. No problem.
