American,Businessman
I wanted to let my employees know what will come if they make the wrong choice. They need to worry if Obama gets reelected.
I haven't bought a yacht or an island or even a palm tree.
I was making so much money I didn't care. I didn't know what to do with the money.
The campaign commercials don't tell you anything.
Lots of small business men have been contacting me to say they wish they had the nerve to say what I said.
The United States is like a big company, and we need a CEO to run it.
I'm not optimistic.
I doubt if there will ever be another Republican president in my lifetime.
I have enough money for the rest of my life and enough to leave a good inheritance for our kids.
The combination of Obamacare and taxes would be a disaster.
I can't tell anyone to vote.
Business is at the heart of America and always has been.
