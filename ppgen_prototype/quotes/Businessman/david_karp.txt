American,Businessman
There are a lot of rich people in the world. There are very few people who have the privilege of getting to invent things that billions of people use.
I'm very antischedule. Except for board meetings, I don't really schedule things or keep a calendar. I think appointments are caustic to creativity.
People tell me I need an assistant, but I don't want one.
I've found that if you're not responsive to e-mail, it trains people to leave you alone.
I always carry my camera with me.
Where I feel the most productive and engaged is when I'm buried in code, buried in some project, tweaking some designs. I'm certainly introverted.
Today there are millions of people making stuff and putting it into the world: that's become part of our identity and it shouldn't be limited to people who fancy themselves writers, or who are particularly witty or talented.
Reading for me will be a combination of books, magazines, Tumblr and just kind of the Web in general on the iPad.
I want to build something I'd be happy to be employed by 10 years out.
I never spent much time with people my own age.
