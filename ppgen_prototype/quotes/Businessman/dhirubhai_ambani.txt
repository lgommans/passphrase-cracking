Indian,Businessman
The success of the young entrepreneur will be the key to India's transformation in the new millennium.
My advice to young entrepreneurs is not to accept defeat in the face of odds, and challenge negative forces with hope, self-confidence and conviction.
I sincerely believe that Indians have the ability to compete with the best in the world.
