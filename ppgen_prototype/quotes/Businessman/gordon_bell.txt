People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone - their address book is in a cell phone.
I don't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory. I think it's important to be able to remember things accurately.
I started working occasionally for my father when I was around six. The first skill I learned was how to join a plug to a wire.
Well, I got to have a project. I'm not a blue-sky guy at all. I'd never let anybody like me loose in a company.
My mother had been a grade-school teacher, and my father had an eighth-grade education.
I tend to always carry a camera with me. I live next to a fire station, and I've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house. And I like food, so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time. To me those are very pleasant memories.
I'm on Facebook and Twitter, and occasionally I will tweet something. Somehow my problem is that I don't think I have anything interesting to tweet about.
