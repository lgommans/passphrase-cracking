I went to Harvard College and determined right away when I was a junior that I was unemployable, since I think I applied to 300 jobs and didn't get any of them, so I decided that I would stay in school and go to Harvard Business school, and that's my background.
My advice to young people is to get something that's growing because that's how you get career opportunities thrown at you that you don't deserve, if you will... that come at you early because the firms need you.
