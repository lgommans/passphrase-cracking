American,Businessman
To do a common thing uncommonly well brings success.
Mountains and oceans do not furnish any impassable barrier to the extension of trade.
Protect the consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil to the table.
Heart power is stronger than horsepower.
It is more pleasant to remember others than to be remembered.
I am an American in every fiber of my body and in every heartbeat.
Always plenty to do. Cannot well be idle and believe will rather wear out than rust out.
A man is nowhere without money.
