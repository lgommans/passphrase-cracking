Chinese,Businessman
Doing a mall is not only construction of the physical place: what is important is the merchandising mix. We strive to serve the convenience of the public. We want shopping at our malls to be a unique and an enjoyable experience.
My businesses are all related - retail, shopping centers, banking, real estate, and tourism development. Together they create synergy.
My basic strategy is to stick to my core business and to my area of expertise.
I used to roller skate a lot in my youth on Taft Avenue, Manila. That is the reason there is always a skating area in all my SM malls. I want more people to share my love for skating.
I started with shoes, and with hard work and discipline, the business prospered.
I've always wanted to be a businessman. No other ambitions - I just wanted to be in business, even when I was a child in Fujian province, south China.
I took a risk and invested in SM Mall of Asia because I wanted to create something that could contribute to Philippine tourism growth.
Ever since I was a kid, I've always believed in doing my best, that one should aspire to be No. 1.
Our businesses also help promote socio-economic progress.
