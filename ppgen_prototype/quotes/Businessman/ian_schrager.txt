American,Businessman
Great ideas have no attachment to either money or class.
Good design is good business.
I'm not into nostalgia, and I only look back to find lessons.
When I travel, I just take what I need and I run. I always have my briefcase stuffed with work, even when I go on a holiday.
My best vacation was renting a boat and motoring along the Adriatic, going along the Croatian coast, before it became so fashionable. I've also sailed around the Turkish islands, the Greek islands and Sicily.
I consider myself fortunate to have grown up in Brooklyn. It's what gave me my drive to succeed, the upward mobility I've been after my whole life.
The trimmings of wealth are not as important to me and my generation as they were to my parents' generation.
Status based on wealth is an old-fashioned idea; I find it repugnant, actually.
The music I listened to as a kid - the Stones, the Beatles - that was so rebellious at the time, it became mainstream.
I have to be more universal than my projects, but no less innovative.
