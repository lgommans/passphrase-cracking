Sports are one of the main cultural activities on the face of the earth.
As long as I own this football team and long after I'm gone, they will always be the Washington Redskins.
Having this interest here in the Redskins is the chief hobby of my life.
Nobody's going to write a book about me, because nobody's going to find anything worth writing a book about.
I have spoken to many, many Indian chiefs who say they have no objection whatsoever to the nickname.
The name of the Redskins will remain the Redskins.
I don't intend to die.
I've always had a will to succeed, to win, however you phrase it.
