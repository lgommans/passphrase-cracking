French,Businessman
Everyone is looking for a purpose in life. The reason we all go to the cinema or online is because we haven't found a purpose yet. We are always wondering why we're here. But I've learned that we have to create that purpose for ourselves.
My purpose, which I finally found thanks to social media, is helping all of these people find their purpose.
When I arrived in New York, I was homeless with 400 bucks in my pocket.
I took the decision that everything I would post would be positive. If you say, 'Ahh, I feel terrible today,' and you spread that to the eyes and ears of millions of people, that's not good.
