Hyatt lost its appeal because it was too big a machine. It's easy to systematize economies of scale, but you slowly lose who you are.
I like walking into a smaller hotel where the desk clerk recognizes me.
All you need to do is to get clients in the hotel door; then they hand you their wallets for five days.
