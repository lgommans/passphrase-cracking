Do not be fooled into believing that because a man is rich he is necessarily smart. There is ample proof to the contrary.
Early in my business career I learned the folly of worrying about anything. I have always worked as hard as I could, but when a thing went wrong and could not be righted, I dismissed it from my mind.
