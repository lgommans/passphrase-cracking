The sun never sets on my gallery.
Honestly, I grew up in pretty modest circumstances. We were a middle-class family.
I was always very focused on how people dressed.
I never really took a proper art class in college. I just started reading art magazines and going to galleries. I was really drawn to it.
You get to a point where you really can't manage more artists, because representing artists takes a lot of time.
When a great artist gets my attention, I pursue it. If I don't, someone else will, you know what I'm saying?
I don't wear plaid shirts.
The art market is global now, and there's becoming more of an international consensus about what constitutes good art.
Physically, it's getting impossible for me to travel that much. I want to support my artists by showing up at their openings, but I can't always be in Hong Kong one minute and Geneva the next.
I'm not in the luxury-goods business. I sell unique objects. I wish I was in luxury goods because then I could just call the factory and say, 'I need 10,000 more of whatever.' But I can't - because then it's not art, it's something else.
The art world is never going to be popular like the NFL, but more people are buying art and I think that's cushioning, to a great extent, our art-market cycles.
