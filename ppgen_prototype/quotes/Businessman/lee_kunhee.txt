South Korean,Businessman
Samsung's future hinges on new businesses, new products and new technologies. We should make our corporate culture more open, flexible and innovative.
Korea can't become a 'first-class' nation unless regulation and 'a sense of power' disappear. The nation's politics is the fourth-class, bureaucratic are the third-class, and business is the second-class.
There's an ongoing competition by global companies across all areas from products, technology development and hiring talented people to patent disputes. The market is big and opportunities are wide open, so we should find out new businesses that Samsung's future will hinge on.
With the sincere devotion of our employees, Samsung has achieved stellar performances since its foundation.
