Chinese,Businessman
Our development strategy is based on a deep understanding of our customers. They want high-quality products and good service.
As for opportunities, there is room for improved product quality and better service and raising our technology standard. In addition, we should have a certain share of the global market. However, we should consider new industries, such as resource development.
I like to have a sense of accomplishment through work. I'm busy golfing and attending activities, but I think of holding a meeting as playing golf. I think my approach is very good. I don't feel I lose a lot of fun things in life even though I am busy all day.
Value is created for the customer, and that allows our suppliers, agents and staff that work with Sany to obtain success.
