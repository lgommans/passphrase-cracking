I knew trucking was growing. It grew from the Second World War to the time that I bought the bridge. There were interstate highways being built. I thought there was opportunity.
I love my country. I love my family.
For me to own land in Detroit, it was a badge of honor, and it was support for the city.
I'm a benefit to the city. I'm not a detriment.
We pay taxes, and we help the city coffers.
We want the city back on its feet. We want to have jobs for the city.
I was a dispatcher, flat-tire fixer, changed the oil, fixed the fan belts. There was nothing too good for me.
That case with my two sisters? That was a disaster. It was. They're really fine people. When my family and my two sisters' families - their children - grew up and so on, it just wasn't the same. But we took care of them very nicely.
I have mended fences with both my sisters. But do I have their families on my side? Not easily. My one sister, Florence, has two lawyers in the family and two doctors. Of course, I couldn't win that battle.
You can't build another bridge that's so close to ours. It's stupid.
