French,Businessman
Not everything is for sale; not everything is about money.
I'm slow to make a decision. I need to think things over for a long time, to weigh the pros and cons, to look at issues 10, 20, or 30 times. But when that's done, I'm quick to act.
When I was young, I didn't like going to school, but I loved my dad. He was my professor.
My successor may need to be more modern than I am. It's a question of generations.
