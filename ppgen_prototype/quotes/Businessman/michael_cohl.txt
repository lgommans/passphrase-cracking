As long as you don't think about the whole big picture, producing 'Spider-Man' is a fantastic experience.
I think 'Spider-man' is a pop culture rock show that was meant to be in arenas.
Very, very rarely do you find bands underpricing.
I am an arena creature - by birth, I think. Most of my life has been spent as a rink rat.
In the beginning, I didn't have to love them, my acts. It was mostly about being successful, getting a trophy, and making some money. Now if I don't love the idea of it, I don't work on it.
Yes, 'Spider-Man' has had an infinite capacity to trouble and disappoint. But it's also been the greatest triumph of my entire career.
