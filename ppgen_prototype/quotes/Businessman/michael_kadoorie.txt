Businessman
I think as you grow up, you have the adjustment to responsibilities. Now you could say that's easy or not easy... but that's a difficult period of your life. You have the loss of loved ones, which then means you have more responsibilities. Periods in business when things don't run evenly.
Tradition means taking account of a wonderful history but remembering that everybody today looks to the future.
I think we all achieve a little. You can say, 'That's relative.' But when you think of world events, it really is very small.
