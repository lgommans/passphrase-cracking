Today, a skilled manager makes more than the owner. And owners fight each other to get the skilled managers.
This demonstration of power, indifferent to the law, is highly dangerous.
A left turn in the fate of Russia is as necessary as it is inevitable.
Large companies cannot finance political parties as their shareholders and employees have different political views.
I'm not an ordinary prisoner.
I have always defended my convictions and what I believed to be the truth.
I established my bank in 1988.

My parents were Muscovites. They worked at the Kaliber factory.
My father was a construction engineer, and my mother was a production engineer.
I have to travel a lot, but relaxation to me is when I am at home.
As for the company, I did all I could from the very outset of this affair to remove Yukos and its employees from danger.
What's important to me now is to uphold my good name and achieve a fair court decision - the past cannot be recovered anyway.
To admit guilt for nonexistent crimes is unacceptable to me.
