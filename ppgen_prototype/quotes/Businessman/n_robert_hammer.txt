There is no denying that downsizing can happen when a company receives private equity funding. It is unfortunate and hard on everyone who is affected.
Private equity helps produce strong companies, promotes innovation and spurs job growth.
Product pricing is aligned to the way customers want to acquire their solutions and are delivered via different delivery models including appliances, the cloud, or as on-premise software solutions.
Private equity funds a substantial amount of new businesses and is the source of capital to rejuvenate failing businesses, which are major drivers of job growth in this economy.
One of my major objectives is to build a long-term enterprise, to build shareholder value over time.
We have innovative differentiated technology that is recognized by our customers and third party analysts as the best in the industry; we have industry-leading support with a very large satisfied installed base due to our best-in-class support and development organisations.
I have either run private equity funded companies or been a partner in a private equity fund since 1982. I've had a front row view of the vital role private equity continues to play in building and keeping American businesses competitive in the global economy.
The good thing about execution issues are that they are within our control.
