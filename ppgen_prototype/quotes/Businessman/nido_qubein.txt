American,Businessman
Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.
Change brings opportunity.
What if you could be anything, or anybody, you chose to be? Think about it. What would you choose to be?
For the timid, change is frightening; for the comfortable, change is threatening; but for the confident, change is opportunity.
One of the greatest resources people cannot mobilize themselves is that they try to accomplish great things. Most worthwhile achievements are the result of many little things done in a single direction.
Nothing can add more power to your life than concentrating all your energies on a limited set of targets.
I only wish I had more time for fund raising.
