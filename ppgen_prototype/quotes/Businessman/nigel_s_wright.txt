Canadian,Businessman
I have invested at least 20 years in business and my own reputation. I'm excited to come into public service, because I think I have something to offer and to contribute. In no way will I put myself in a position of undoing what's taken 20 years to build.
My actions were intended solely to secure the repayment of funds, which I considered to be in the public interest, and I accept sole responsibility. I did not advise the prime minister of the means by which Sen. Duffy's expenses were repaid, either before or after the fact.
Public policy has been a passion of mine. For three decades, I've had some involvement in the political process.
I am very pleased to be back at Onex and am looking forward to helping build our business.
