Well, darling, you can have your tearoom now.
If the picture speaks to me, if it tells me something about myself, then I want it. Then I have to have it.
I liked money more than going to school.
These are the people who are going to see the pictures in my museum.
All right, I will read what's in my pocket.
To me, such functions are like supermarket openings.
