When you're doing a startup, life is not all roses and rainbows, like you see on Instagram, and killing it.
Customers are using BetterWorks in a number of creative ways to reward and incentivize employees.
The Bay Area definitely knows the pain of competing for, and retaining, top talent. Offering interesting perks has become a necessity, not a nice-to-have.
When you read about the best places to work, it's never about salary; it's about catered lunches, the daycare - it's the cool stuff that matters.
I've built employee perks programs before and it's impossible to manually build a program that makes everyone happy. I'd make a deal with one gym then hear about another gym an employee would prefer. As a small business owner, I didn't have the time or leverage to negotiate and manage dozens of vendor relationships.
L.A. has always had a ton of creative business people, but tech has always been trumped by Hollywood. Now Hollywood is realizing it needs to be smarter in tech. Hollywood is finally crossing over, and it's really going to charge L.A. to be the next tech center.
Anytime something eats too much of my life, I kill it.
If people make a lot of introductions, should they get recognized for it? I've never seen a score showing who's a good connector. That'd be useful, right?
Medicine, you have to take it. A vitamin is nice to have, but honestly, you can skip it.
As an HR Manager, you don't have to build a top-down perks program. You decide how much you want to invest in your employees, and then you give your employees the control to build a custom perk package for themselves.
I like big thinkers who, no matter how big their vision, can sit down and talk to me about hour-to-hour, day-to-day type stuff they do to move the ball forward.
