Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.
Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.
Crystallize your goals. Make a plan for achieving them and set yourself a deadline. Then, with supreme confidence, determination and disregard for obstacles and other people's criticisms, carry out your plan.
Enthusiasm is the yeast that raises the dough.
Enthusiasm glows, radiates, permeates and immediately captures everyone's interest.
Mistakes are merely steps up the ladder.
Success is the progressive realization of predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals.
Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon... must inevitably come to pass!
If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.
Consider every mistake you do make as an asset.
Enter every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of defeat. Concentrate on your strengths, instead of your weaknesses... on your powers, instead of your problems.
Do a little bit more than average and from that point on our progress multiplies itself out of all proportion to the effort put in.
Writing crystallizes thought and thought produces action.
