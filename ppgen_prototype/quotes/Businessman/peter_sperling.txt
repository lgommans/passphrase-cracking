American,Businessman
Arcadia is one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in all of Arizona, and I love living here.
It is no accident that our business, The University of Phoenix, is one of the top 50 community-minded companies in America. My father and I are strong believers in the concept of community.
Both my father and I remodeled our homes but were quite careful about preserving the history and unique character of the community.
It's nearly impossible to overstate how fully my father has devoted himself to Apollo Group and its mission since he created Apollo Group four decades ago.
We are very fortunate to have Matt Carter join the Apollo board. Matt brings deep management, operations, marketing and international business expertise to the company, along with a track record of growing and strengthening well-known consumer brands.
