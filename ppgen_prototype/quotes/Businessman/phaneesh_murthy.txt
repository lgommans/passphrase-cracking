Indian,Businessman
I'm lucky because I have the ability to look at the brighter side of life.
Lot of companies are looking for advisory work on business strategy, restructuring work.
Somebody once told me that self-punishment is worse than any other punishment.
I have met so many people who are negative, and it tells on their attitude towards life and towards everything.
