American,Businessman
From the time I was a kid, I was always interested in any and all kinds of new business ideas.
I know people like to work for me, and quite a few have gotten rich working for me.
I may not have the gun that Jesse James had when he was gunned down, but if there's a piece identified with him and the same place, then I get interested; it's always excited me.
