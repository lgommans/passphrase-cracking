Australian,Businessman
I hate weekends because there is no stock market.
When buying shares, ask yourself, would you buy the whole company?
I love the market, it is my work, my play and my life.
I think one can achieve a very pleasant lifestyle by treating human beings, fellow human beings, very well.
