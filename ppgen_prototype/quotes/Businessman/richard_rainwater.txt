Algerian,Businessman
I view real estate as the most intriguing opportunity that I've seen in my business lifetime.
Someone asked me what are the secrets to my success, and I said 'There are three: Timing, timing, timing.'
I don't understand the theory that nonprofit hospitals that run at forty percent capacity and do not pay taxes should be granted some special privilege. I like level playing fields.
There's always something happening in the world that creates an opportunity to try to fix a business and build a business.
I'm just not the type who wants to draw attention to himself.
The essence of good business is knowing when to step on a train and when to step off.
If you happen to be in the right place at the right time, the capitalist system is a beautiful thing.
I sold my Chevron. I sold my ConocoPhillips. I sold my Statoil. I sold my ENSCO. I sold my Pioneer Natural Resources. I sold everything.
