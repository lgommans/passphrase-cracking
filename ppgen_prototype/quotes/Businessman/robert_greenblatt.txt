I have throbbing headaches about a lot of things, and Howard Stern isn't one of them.
The beauty of cable is you could program for 18-year-old twins and get a hit show on cable.
My dream as a teenager was to run a movie studio, as in the old studio system.
I've just always been a proponent of having a lot of diversity in the shows I've done. I just think that's the world we live in.
Every so often, it's time to make a change with a showrunner; you evaluate the creative and how the show is run, how the writing staff works.
The shows you can do in cable are just more buzzworthy and are about subject matter that's more unusual or dark. And broadcast shows tend to be more mainstream or middle-of-the-road.
Comedy is king for me; it's the genre that everyone loves.
