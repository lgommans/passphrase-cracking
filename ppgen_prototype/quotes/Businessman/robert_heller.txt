Effective management always means asking the right question.
Never ignore a gut feeling, but never believe that it's enough.
Fear is excitement without breath.
The first myth of management is that it exists. The second myth of management is that success equals skill.
The difference between management and administration (which is what bureaucrats used to do exclusively) is the difference between choice and rigidity.
