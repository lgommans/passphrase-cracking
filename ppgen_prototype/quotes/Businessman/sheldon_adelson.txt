American,Businessman
Why do I need succession planning? I'm very alert, I'm very vibrant. I have no intention to retire.
I look at every business and ask, How long can this last? How can I identify the status quo and change it?
If I were to retire, I would keep my family's interest in the company the same and say, Don't sell.
I've already figured out when I'm going to be No. 2 and No. 1.
I see this as my humanitarian legacy. We're prepared to pay billions.
