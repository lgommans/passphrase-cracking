Italian,Businessman
We will make La Perla a great international brand for beauty and feminine luxury.
We realized that Elite has the potential to really add value to a company like La Perla, due to its relationship to the fashion business, links to music, to entertainment, all of this tends to point more and more to the luxury consumer. The fashion world is one where Italy has clear excellence. I see the potential with it very clearly.
I don't want to be known as a serial entrepreneur. I like doing one thing at a time and making sure that gets my full attention until it's well established. I enjoy the initial years of a company because they are the most dynamic, and that is when I can give the best of myself.
Technological transformations give you the chance to set up new and ambitious ventures. That's what I did with FastWeb and that is what we are doing with Babelgum. This is much more than TV because we are making the content available all across the world and you have an open platform with freedom of choice.
There are literally tens of thousands of very good content providers in the world that don't distribute their content through TV channels.
Babelgum has no ties to individual content owners and distributors, and as a result our editorial strategy is primarily 'user-centric.' That strategy ensures the platform satisfies the needs of a potentially infinite number of niche audiences around the world.
By validating and aggregating the best material from a wide range of independent and mainstream content owners, Babelgum aims to encourage common interest communities that are not well served by traditional television.
E.Biscom is an Internet company that is diversified, not a diversified company that is trying out the Internet.
