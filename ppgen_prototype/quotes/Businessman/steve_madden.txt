American,Businessman
People are afraid because I'm candid. They're always worried I'm going to get into trouble.
You need to define yourself in the marketplace.
I could design an $800 shoe line; it's easy. You use the best materials and you can make beautiful shoes. It's easier than making great shoes for $90.
I've been making shoes my whole life.
My strengths as a businessman lie in the design and sale of women's shoes, and I have never been comfortable with complicated or technical legal or business documents.
Growing is an important part of the business, but more important than that is to get better.
There are a lot of people who get support from a thriving business.
I don't fret much about the natural life spans of shoe companies. If stores don't do the right things, they cease to exist, and that doesn't trouble me at all.
So much of design is context.
I'd like to work with Damien Hirst.
I'm a New York story.
You have to be a little contrite to get redemption.
I am guilty of stupidity, arrogance, and greed.
