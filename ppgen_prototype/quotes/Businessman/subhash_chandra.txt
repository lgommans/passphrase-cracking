I can meditate anywhere, anytime, even whilst talking to you.
As a businessman, my dharma is to cater to every taste of my viewer.
Digitisation will rather consolidate the broadcasting industry in India because once the cable is digitized, then naturally all the programmers can showcase their programming.

I often say that it's only people who have their skin in the business who'll work towards its success.
I had benefited so much from Vipassana, I felt it was important for many more people to be able to share the experience.
