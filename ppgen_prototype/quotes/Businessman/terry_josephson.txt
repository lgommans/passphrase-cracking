American,Businessman
No matter where you go or what you do, you live your entire life within the confines of your head.
I am not God, but I am my creator.
Never let inexperience get in the way of ambition.
If you don't appreciate it, you don't deserve it.
Stop thinking in terms of limitations and start thinking in terms of possibilities.
