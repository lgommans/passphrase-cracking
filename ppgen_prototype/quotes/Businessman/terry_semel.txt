Our new attitude is how can we put you in front of our customer.
There is nothing to be embarrassed about being profitable.
Sometimes, on a personal level, I wince.
The Internet and Yahoo are firmly established as 'must buys' for brand advertising.
Yahoo! is the only company with both scale and leadership in branded and search advertising.
I don't think that Yahoo or any other Internet company should try to become a television network. We will be nowhere if we have to create our own content.
I myself am a builder and get totally excited about building Yahoo! as a brand and building it into a bigger and better company. That's what I intend to do.
While more great films are being made every year, it is increasingly difficult to get indies into theaters or on TV.
At Yahoo, we were one of the early proponents of the power of content showcased through new media. SnagFilms, with its large library and breadth of digital distribution, can help shape this next phase, bringing great stories to broad new audiences.
When I began working in Yahoo, my family moved with me. Despite our efforts, our kids wanted to study in Los Angeles, and I was forced to see my family and friends only on weekends. In the beginning I even enjoyed it, but knew that at some stage I'd want to go back home.
Search, which is extremely important, represents about 5% of the page views on the Internet and 40% of the revenue. So, highly monetized.
Yahoo is all about content. Deep reservoirs of important content in many, many strong areas.
