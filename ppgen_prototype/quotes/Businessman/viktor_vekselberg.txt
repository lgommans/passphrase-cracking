Ukrainian,Businessman
My personal opinion is that I'm in the media too much. I'm not a politician, I'm a businessman. I would like to be without any extra visibility.
I like football, but I think this is a very personal matter. I don't see any negatives for some Russian rich man to buy a football club.
My parents were ordinary people; we lived in a small apartment.
In Russia, or anywhere, people don't like rich people. Yeah, OK, I have money, but the question is how I use it. It's not easy, believe me; it's not easy.
