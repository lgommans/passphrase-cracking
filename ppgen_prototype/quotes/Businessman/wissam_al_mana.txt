Businessman
I spend time with my wife. It's a luxury. We love travelling... we love going to nice, exotic places far away from the world and from prying eyes.
You can ask me anything you want; I'm very opinionated... except about my private life. I don't want to talk about that.
I don't have Facebook; I don't have Twitter. I don't have anything because, believe it or not, I'm a very, very private person! I don't even have WhatsApp! I don't like to pry into people's business.
Time is like a very good friend who you don't see very often.
