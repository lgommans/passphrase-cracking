I think leadership is service and there is power in that giving: to help people, to inspire and motivate them to reach their fullest potential.
I've been preparing to run a big company all my life.
My parents had job jars because my father would say, 'Kids today have too much time, too much money and no responsibility. You're going to have no time, no money and a lot of responsibility.'
Most corporations have human-resources processes that involve discussions with your manager, performance evaluations, calibrations for performance and potential succession planning.
The leader is the person who brings a little magic to the moment.
The thing that I learned early on is you really need to set goals in your life, both short-term and long-term, just like you do in business. Having that long-term goal will enable you to have a plan on how to achieve it.
I can cite numerous sponsors at different places in my career that made a huge difference for me just in terms of pulling me aside and giving me a tip or some coaching, or just watching what I was doing and not being afraid to tell me the truth about it.
I was so results-oriented.
I do think the position I play is a powerful position.
If you want a CEO role, you have to prepare for it with a vengeance.
I am one of four girls and was inspired by my father to dream big. Some girls want to be doctors, but I wanted to run a company.
