Austrian,Businesswoman
I've had three husbands, but my real romance is my work.
My clothes are built to show off the woman who wears them. I like them to be simple... to move well, to move with the times and a little ahead of the times.
To show the American woman herself off to best advantage - that has always been my aim and that is my real biography.
Taste is so much more important than fashion.
