How many wives have been forced by the death of well-intentioned but too protective husbands to face reality late in life, bewildered and frightened because they were strangers to it!
It seemed pathetic and terrible to me and it still does, that men and women work eight hours a day at jobs that bring them no joy, no reward save a few dollars.
It is not serving, but servility, that is menial.
No life if it is properly realized is without its cosmic importance.
One of the greatest satisfactions one can ever have, comes from the knowledge that he can do some one thing superlatively well.
If a person goes to his job with a firm determination to give of himself the best of which he is capable, that job no matter what it is takes on dignity and importance.
