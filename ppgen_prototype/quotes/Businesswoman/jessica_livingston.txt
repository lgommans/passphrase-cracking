Cofounders will endure so much together that their relationship is often compared to a marriage.
Finding a programmer to work with if you don't already know one will be a challenge. Merely judging if a programmer is exceptional vs. competent will be very hard if you are not one yourself. When you do find someone, work together informally for a while to test your compatibility.
Finding a technical cofounder would have been difficult for me. I was an English major and didn't know any computer programmers.
