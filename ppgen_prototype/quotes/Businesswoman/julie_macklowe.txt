I'll be the first one to tell you that I'm not the most casual person.
My view is that you have to take risks. Not everything is going to work out, but it's sort of the fun of fashion, right?
I feel like there is an underappreciation for ball gowns. You see them on the runway, but they rarely ever get worn, so there is something special and unique in getting to wear these creations; it's wearable art.
