American,Businesswoman
We all have different perspectives on the world. I'm a woman. I live in Chicago. I'm gay.
When I was 5, I wore a tie, and I wanted to change my name to Larry, which probably tipped my parents off that I was gay.
I don't really like politics, to be honest. But it's other people making decisions about my life and my country and my child's education... I wish we didn't have so much money in politics, but that's not the world we live in. If we don't play here, we forfeit. And I'm not willing to forfeit my rights.
Being a woman and being gay is really a unique position in our society. I know in my experience of activism, oftentimes it makes a difference if something is women-focused. It's likely to get the attention of women much more easily.
My hope is that we will inspire more lesbians to get politically engaged. For too long, lesbian women have been left out of politics.
I think for a long time I wasn't really out to myself growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It took me a while to come out to myself, and not long after that, I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive.
