Brazilian,Businesswoman
It was not easy to get to where I am. My challenge is to learn to deal with the jokes that are common among men that I heard and continue to hear sometimes among men.
My childhood was happy, joyful but very difficult.
We didn't have much money. My whole extended family used to help us, and buy us books and food. It was hard, and there were things I didn't want to talk about. But at the end I was a happy girl.
I am a focused person. I am a fighter.
I thank my mother, Terezinha, for the power of her transforming love.
I have two children. I gave up a lot for my career, but I'm very happy for it. I've done what I've always thought was best for me and my family.
I lived in Complexo do Alemao until I was 12, dealt with domestic violence in my childhood and faced difficulties in life.
I always studied because I knew I had to. I needed to survive and take care of my mother.
