My parents loved music, and my father would come home with cassette tapes of Chic and the Village People and Barbra Streisand. We had all these sounds always going. We never had somber music - always upbeat.
When you're young, you worry about what other people think. The older you get, the less that matters.
The truth is, I was D.J.-ing on my college radio station in 1987, and I was called 'Mad Marj.'
I have my hair done by Valery Joseph, who does a version of the Palm Beach crash helmet so that it doesn't move.
I'm a person who floats in many different groups.
I don't think people should be fed mesclun salad and chicken breast. My grandmother would serve grits and oxtail stew at a formal dinner, and if you didn't like it, well then you ate more beans or you went home and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
In Newport, we serve cheese or bacon-wrapped water chestnuts.
