I believe the world to be a muffin pan, and there certainly are a lot of muffins here.
I find when I'm more awake, I tend to think more of the structure and movement of a tune, abrupt transitions, etc.; things becoming more composed.
I just do these 'Sleep' type tracks when the situation presents itself. I never set out to do them, like wait all day until I'm really tired or something. Gotta come natural.
The tracks on 'Sleep' were recorded live to 2-track. I did a fadeout or two of them, but that's really it.
I love the immediacy of those old analog machines; it's really inspiring. You just set them up to play, and they go, playing the same thing until you switch the pattern.
