I don't think I do have a soul.
I started writing when I was about thirteen.
In my own mind, I was sort of a desperate kid.
I was desperately unhappy trying to adjust to the world.
I'm not religious in any formal sense, not in any God sense.
Things were so bad we ate rabbits that neighbours had run over and gave to us because they knew we were broke.
At a certain age you're always uncertain how other people will take you.
