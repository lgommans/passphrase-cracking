'Orphan Black' tends to, for their auditions, shroud it in secrecy and change names.
My mum was a dancer when she was a kid. Then my parents met and eventually had an art gallery; my dad taught himself how to frame pictures, and then he was a curator at an art gallery in the city I'm from. I'm an only child.
It doesn't come easily to me, comedy. It's definitely not my strong suit. I'm probably more suited for drama and dramatic roles, but I certainly would love to be in quirky and fun movies.
I think comedy is one of the hardest things to pull off. You either have timing or you don't, and that's something I don't have for sure.
Just going to Comic-Con alone, that's an unreal experience on its own. I think if everyone in the world could experience that place, it would change their outlook. It's just one big lovefest. It's pretty incredible.
Nick Abraham and I had known each other from Ryerson University.
'Clone Club' is incredible - probably the best set of fans any show could ever hope for.
Early in my career, I'd plan something out for my characters. But I've learned that if you know who your character is and you go on instinct, it won't be wrong. It's never wrong. It's just different.
