I honestly don't know how many pairs of shoes I have - about 100 in use. It sounds so bad. I splurge when I work hard.
As a little girl, I was athletic: 'Oh, mom, look at me. I can do cartwheels.' I was one of those annoying kids. I craved the spotlight. I had the feeling since I was little that the stage was my home.
I like my heels as high as we can get them. I show skin where it is appropriate.
My style is chic, streamlined and original. I don't like to wear the same things as other people - I push boundaries. Growing up, I was really excited about costumes.
I always kind of wanted to be on 'CSI.' I'm kind of addicted to that show right now. I've never gotten to die in something, and I know that's a little gruesome, but I just think it would be really fun - I'd make it as dramatic as possible.
