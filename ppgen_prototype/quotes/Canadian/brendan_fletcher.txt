I started out doing music videos and photography, and I always loved writing.
I found myself drawn to the remote Kimberley region of Australia - in the far Northwest corner of the country - our last frontier. I still can't explain why. I kept coming back over many years and started shooting material.

'Amores Perros' and 'Once Were Warriors' had a tremendous visceral quality that really influenced me.
'Into The Wild' had a great sense of wild, unpredictable freedom that I loved, and 'Unforgiven' is just a great western with characters that walked the line between right/wrong with an ambiguity that felt very true to frontier life.
