Canadian,Actor
Every year I try and challenge myself more and more, whether it be acting or everything I do. I just want to try and be better than the year before.
I haven't had a chance really to do a martial arts role, but I really want to. I want to act like Jackie Chan in a movie.
I believe in ghosts now because of New Orleans. I never did before. I was so skeptical, but now I've seen one, which sounds insane, but it's true.
I've seen a ghost in my bathroom with no face, this is true by the way, and I had a yo-yo that rolled up a hill in my apartment. My place is a little slanted. I have no idea how that happened.
