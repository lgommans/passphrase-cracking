I've had some crazy fan experiences, yeah. Crying girls, screaming girls, a lot of butt-grabbing.
I'm getting offered roles that aren't designed for aboriginal people; they're designed for anybody. It's pretty surreal and mind-blowing.
I'd go for roles that would say 'for all ethnicities,' but what they're pretty much saying is, 'We want a Caucasian guy or a black guy.' One or the other.
