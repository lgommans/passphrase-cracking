I'm the star of the show. I should have a decent haircut.
I remember on 'JAG,' Joe Jackson punched Stephen Culp and shattered his nose.
I grew up playing war. We threw dirt and rocks at each other. We'd lead attacks. We'd break up into squads. It became a neighborhood thing for a while, our neighborhood against the other neighborhood. There was always a war breaking out somewhere.
Maybe our young people are not as vacuous as we would like to lead ourselves to believe - that all they're interested in is hairdos and looking at other beautiful people. Maybe they're interested in learning something.
I once got a letter from a woman who told me she was 90. She said if she were 30 years younger, I would have had to watch out. I guess 60 seems really young when you're 90. She said she would eat me with a spoon.
I had never done any theater in high school, which actually worked to my benefit. I didn't develop any bad habits.
You can never rely on musicians. I quit high school at one point to make a go of it with this band and we kept breaking up. So I went back to school.
I worked with a man named Patty Crane who was Errol Flynn's stand-in back in the '30s in Hollywood.
Usually in fist fights you get punched in the face.
But I do enjoy the freedom of doing a movie and then having some time off.
I've never made choices based on money - I always trust my gut.
I've always been fairly reserved and laid-back.
