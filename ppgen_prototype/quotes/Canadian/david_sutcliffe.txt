Canadian,Actor
It's a lot of fun to be able to run around with guns and scream and yell and do the kind of FBI-cop kind of stuff, which is different than what I've been doing, which is kind of playing the boy-girl thing. Its always fun to kiss the pretty girl, but sometimes, amazingly, you can get bored with that, too.
I've just become obsessed with ballroom dancing. I signed up for the introductory course, which was like a four-week thing. By the end of it, I was hooked. I love it. It's sort of flirty, but it's not sexual. I can't quit until I've got it down and I can really dance. I'm there four or five times a week.
I'm an actor; I'm vain - you want to look good.
The reality is I meet a lot of actresses. They're wonderful, beautiful ladies. It's pretty hard to stay away from them. You know, there's worse problems to have.
It's a beautiful drive across the United States. It's so interesting. I'm a proud Canadian, and there are so many beautiful parts of Canada, but the United States also has incredible diversity in its landscape.
Los Angeles is an amazing city to live in, but the traffic is unbelievable. It's overwhelming at times. It's the source of a lot of frustration.
Acting-wise, I haven't done a lot of comedy, so I would love to work with Jane Lynch. I think she's hilarious.
