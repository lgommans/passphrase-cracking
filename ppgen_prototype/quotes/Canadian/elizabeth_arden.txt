Repetition makes reputation and reputation makes customers.
There's only one Elizabeth like me and that's the Queen.
Hold fast to life and youth.
I only want people around me who can do the impossible.
Every woman has the right to be beautiful.

Dear, never forget one little point. It's my business. You just work here.
Hold fast to youth and beauty.
Nothing that costs only a dollar is not worth having.
