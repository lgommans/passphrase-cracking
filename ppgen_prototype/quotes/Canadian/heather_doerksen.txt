Canadian,Actress
I used to write on my resume that I was shorter than I was because I thought it would inhibit my roles, and as soon as I embraced that I am a tall female, I started getting really fantastic roles and really didn't even worry about wearing heels.
I typically do yoga and I walk everywhere, and that's how I get my exercise.
I really like to do comedy, and I did comedy the first 2 years after I graduated college, so I really love it and appreciate it.
I do like reality TV. I've always liked 'Survivor' since season 1.
