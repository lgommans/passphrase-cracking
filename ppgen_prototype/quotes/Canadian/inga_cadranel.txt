It's not that I don't want a fast car. I like the speed. I'm just not the type of person who finds a sports car a sexy car.
You would never see me driving around in a sports car. I feel like you're so low and squish-able by transport trucks.
I like guys who drive trucks.
People who drive Jeeps are people who like to do outdoor activities.
When we were growing up, we had all these crazy, in-your-face guys around the house. For us, it was like, 'Ugh! Actors again.'
