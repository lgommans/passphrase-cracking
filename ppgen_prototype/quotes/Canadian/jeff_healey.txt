Canadian,Musician
Not only did I get to play with these great international musicians, but I also had the opportunity to jam with the local celebrities in Toronto, people like the Walsh Brothers, David Wilcox, Kim Mitchell and the like. It was a great learning experience.
Hi, I'm Jeff Healy of the Jeff Healy band. Don't drink and drive. I don't... you're blind!
I progressed through so many different styles of music through my teen years, both as a player and a vocalist, particularly the jazz and pop of the early 20th Century.
I always knew, that in some way, I'd be connected to, and involved in, the music business.
The three years following the release of See The Light were a whirlwind.
