My favorite genre of movies growing up was the romantic comedy.
I know it's a cliche, but I've been happy to go to work every day.
'Monday Mornings' is so utterly different - in so many ways - from anything else I've done, really. I also desperately wanted an ensemble piece, but I couldn't have dreamed of being a part of something like this. I am so lucky.
