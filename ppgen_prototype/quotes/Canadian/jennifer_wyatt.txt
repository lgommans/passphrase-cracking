It really takes likeable superstars to get the attention of the masses.
I started by hacking around the back yard in Richmond.
I am relying on the theory that playing golf is just like riding a bike and that I haven't forgotten how.
I just have to relax before each shot, and let it happen knowing that I've done it a million times before.
It has crossed my mind that I would like to run or help to run a pro women's tournament, although I really don't know much about organizing an event (it seems overwhelming actually).
I think the tour is doing a better job of showing off the personalities of the players with their website, which is filled with tidbits of what the players are up to.
