Canadian,Actress
I have a very irregular life, and by that, I mean I do many different things with my time. No day is the same, which is great for me because as they say, 'Variety is the spice of life,' and I utterly agree and live by that statement.
I was raised on songs of poetry like Simon and Garfunkel and Cat Stevens and Neil Young, etc. I love those old songs probably the most because they hit me so deep down in my core.
I love words; I love poetry.
I used to drive my brothers nuts in the car because I would sing in their ear every song on the radio.
