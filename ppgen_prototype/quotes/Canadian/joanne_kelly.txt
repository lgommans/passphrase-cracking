I'm a child of the literary bent. I don't want to see 140 characters. I want to see a story.
I'm a troglodyte. I think that's the word for it. Like an old school weird person who throws bricks at their computers.
I try to stay away from all the blogs and messages boards.
It's a fine line we walk on 'Warehouse 13.' We really earn our dramatic moments, but our tongues are always firmly in our cheeks. If we take ourselves too seriously, we get into trouble.
I watch 'House of Cards,' which was great. I don't watch a lot. I spend so much time doing it.
