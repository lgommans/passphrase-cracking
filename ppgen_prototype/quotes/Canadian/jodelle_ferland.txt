Sometimes you film in your hometown, sometimes you go halfway across the world.
It is really hard to completely re-learn how to express yourself without using words. When you take away speech, you have to re-invent the way you express yourself. You have to exaggerate your body language and your facial expressions.
After I read 'The Hunger Games,' I went out and got 'Catching Fire' the next day.
There is no schedule in the film industry. It's not like you have a 9 to 5 job every day.
I do think I tend to be typecast, but it doesn't necessarily bother me.
I don't exactly set out to only play creepy characters, it's just that a lot of those roles come my way.
I do not want to play a character who is exactly like me.
I find that as long as I'm acting it doesn't matter if it's for TV, or a series or a short film. I always have fun no matter what I'm doing.
