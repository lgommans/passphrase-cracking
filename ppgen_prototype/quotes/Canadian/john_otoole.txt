Canadian,Politician
There is no way for the American economic system to function without advertising. There is no other way to communicate enough information about enough products to enough people with enough speed.
I believe that a contract, or at least an understanding, exists between the American public and the American advertiser concerning what advertising is, what its limitations are and what price people will pay for it.
When executing advertising, it's best to think of yourself as an uninvited guest in the living room of a prospect who has the magical power to make you disappear instantly.
Political commercials encourage the deceptive, the destructive and the degrading.
Yes, I sell people things they don't need. I can't, however, sell them something they don't want. Even with advertising. Even if I were of a mind to.
