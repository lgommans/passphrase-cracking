I was successful and I enjoyed modeling, but it got to a point where I felt like I had 'been there, done that.' I wanted something that would inspire me and challenge me. I needed something that required more creativity. I started writing and I started auditioning. Simply posing in front of the camera was no longer enough.
I am big in Japan... heightwise! But, yeah, I started modeling there in my teens and into my 20s. I did Calvin Klein, Uniqlo, and lots of magazine covers. It's such a beautiful country, and they have beer vending machines right on the street. Love that!
My dream role would be someone anything that Meryl Streep can do. 'Julia and Julia' - I thought that was beautiful. She just had the essence of her. To truly become someone, invoking emotions like happiness and sadness and everything in between, that's what I want to be able to do.
Performing has always been something I wanted to do. My dad had a video camera and I loved being in front of it.
There was a modeling agency in my little town where I got my start, but the opportunity came to work in Japan when I was fourteen. My mom went with me until I was seventeen. Her only stipulation was that I had to keep my schoolwork up. My mom was great. She is still my best friend.
I've always surrounded myself with people who are driven. You can be gorgeous, but if you don't want to work for it, nothing is not going to happen.
This guy in L.A. asks for my autograph every time I see him. Then I find out he's eBaying 'em for $50. I'm flattered, but no one's going to pay $50 for anyone's autograph, let alone mine.
