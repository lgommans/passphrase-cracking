Canadian,Artist
I wish my work would be recognized by a larger crowd of people as more art than be stuck with the cartoonist label for the rest of my life.
I quit comics because I got completely sick of it. I was drawing comics all the time and didn't have the time or energy to do anything else. That got to me in the end.
I took my courage in both hands and went to the Laundromat to do my washing. I had to use three machines.
I caught a cold and didn't have time to work on my autobiography.
It's not because I'm lucky. I work very hard.
