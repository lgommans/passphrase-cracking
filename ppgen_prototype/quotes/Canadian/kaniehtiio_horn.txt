Canadian,Actress
My mother's Mohawk and my father is Scottish/German from Nova Scotia.
I used to live on a reserve, but I went back and forth between my reserve and Ottawa where my father lived, so I kind of had a double life growing up.
I have a theater background, so I like finding beats, working on things and having rehearsal.
Even though 'Hemlock Grove' was a serious, supernatural mystery, it was pretty fun on set. It was a light mood.
I don't know if I'm able to play a cop for the rest of my life.
I'm from a reserve. A reservation. So I know everybody. Everybody knows me.
It was so crazy, lucky, that 'Defiance' and 'Hemlock Grove' was shooting in Toronto at the same time. I got to be on both of them.
