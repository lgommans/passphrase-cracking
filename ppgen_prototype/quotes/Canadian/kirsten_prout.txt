There's nothing better than sinking into my feather pillows after a hard day's work.
I always find the worst lies are told in relationships - I learned to never lie about your happiness in order to save someone's feelings from being hurt.
I dated a guy for over a year who lied about his age the entire time. I found out after the fact and couldn't believe it! I even threw him a birthday party for the wrong age... I couldn't get over how hard he had tried to keep it a secret!
Being a part of the 'Twilight' phenomenon was life-changing; there is a whole other world of 'Twilight' fandom!
I like sundresses with cowboy boots, little shorts with big wedge heels and a big piece of turquoise. I also love classic, Old Hollywood romantic styles. I'm 'country girl meets city girl' circa 1930.
I have my sweetheart Yorkshire terrier, Tabasco, along with two cats, Romeo and Jasmine. Yes, I am both a Shakespeare and Disney addict.
One of my favorites to order in fancy restaurants is escargot.
Performances are always more interesting to me when something is at stake.
As for dream roles, they usually just speak to you. I just crave complex characters.
I have always loved story - I escaped within it as a child, I read every day, I love figuring out the complex layers of an author's work.
I really love Natalie Portman; she's the real deal.
