Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.
My life has been a blessing. I'm grateful for everything I do have and the places I'm going and the things I've seen.
I am really into color and bright clothing. When I'm wearing heels, I always like to throw some different colors into my outfit, so it doesn't match. That gives my look a retro and funky feel.
I love Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Brandi, Sade, Nat King Cole. I like the Beatles. I listen to a lot of that.
You decide the things that ultimately you do. You have choices in this world, and that's how I live.
My favorite singer is Lauryn Hill - all time, hands down. She was my biggest inspiration growing up.
I grew up seeing my parents perform and sing, and I just always wanted to be singing, too. Music has always been my deepest passion and what I felt most connected to.
My #1 goal is to become a successful singer and share my gift with the world.
I first started to sing when I started to talk. As soon as I could form words and sounds together, I was singing.
I want to be on stage and perform and win Grammys and help out my family in Bulgaria, because they are struggling, and my mom and dad, too.
I just love food, especially my mom's Bulgarian cooking. Taco Bell is my favorite fast food restaurant. I also love Italian food.
I love ballads. I'm not into fast songs. I love to put my heart and all of my feelings into a song.
I think fame comes from actually doing something big with your career.
