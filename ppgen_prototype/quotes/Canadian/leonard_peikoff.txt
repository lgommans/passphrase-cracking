Canadian,Philosopher
Each man must reach his own verdict, by weighing all the relevant evidence.
The more you learn, if you learn it properly, the more clear you become and the more you know.
The unphilosophical majority among men are the ones most helplessly dependent on their era's dominant ideas.
