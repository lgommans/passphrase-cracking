Canadian,Actress
I ate ants. They weren't that bad.
I was in a university prep school in Canada, and the way that particular place worked was, you chose at a very young age what you were going to do with the rest of your life. Mine was law.
I was very aware that my path into the industry would probably be as an actress and not in production, that I could learn a lot that way. And I did.
I don't know so much about making it, because I think of myself as a working actor who's always got my eye on what's going to be the next job. I've been acting for 22 years, and I think there's something to be said for simply staying in the game.
When I got off '24,' pretty soon after that I did a movie that took place in the '70s, this movie with Jimmy Caan and Gena Rowlands, and I needed to kind of have that '70s pouffy housewife hair.
Everything I know about the FBI came from movies! Right? The idea of these kind of uptight, conservative guys whose ties are tied too tight.
At the age of 16, I decided to rebel and become an actress. I wasn't happy with rules and regulations.
There are really only two things I'm terrified of: water and cockroaches.
