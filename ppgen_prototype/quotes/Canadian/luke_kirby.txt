I believe in love at first sight, and I feel sometimes you have to just be open to whatever love is and let yourself fall.
Yeah, I think on my resume it still says that - that I can juggle.
Yeah, I do get to do some theater occasionally. I don't get to do it as much as I would like to.
I have been taking some classes in woodworking. It's really helpful just looking at a problem, and having a very tangible way in constructing it.
But with woodworking, it's really sort of gratifying to be able to have an actual piece to touch, and then step back and be able to share it.
I'm a drama nerd.
