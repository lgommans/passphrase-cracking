I'm 31 years old and I want to be part of a championship team before my career is over.
It was hard to watch, the business side is so big in the game.
Players come and go, good friends, players who performed well. You can't control that.
My job is to make sure we keep performing.
At this level, you put a lot of pressure on yourself as a player to perform and do well.
I think you're a little more fragile when you're younger.
I put a lot of pressure on myself, more than anyone else.
Since I came here I've been treated awesome, in all aspects. I really enjoy playing here.
With the fans and the Toronto Maple Leafs organization, the way I've been treated here has been awesome.
I'm sure once my career's over, when I look back when I'm older, I can maybe appreciate it a little bit more.
Everybody is excited to play so I think who plays with whom is a minor thing at this point.
When I was young, I would go to the races and it was an unbelievable feeling when you'd watch them race.
It's all trotters in Sweden, so that's what's always caught my eye.
Any chance you have to sit back and be the one watching is great.
Seeing someone else perform and letting me be the critic for once... that's not a bad thing.
I've been around racing a fairly long time, but when it comes to the important issues, I'm happy to let others make the big decisions.
I always thought Ray Bourque was a great competitor.
I think people want success, you know, and I'm the captain.
And when things are not going well in Toronto, you're going to hear about it. And you're going to say things are not good at all, where it's really not that bad.
