Canadian,Musician
Sure, give me an adventure and I'll ride it.
This planet Earth, the act of putting a roof over our heads, our flesh and blood existence, it's all very temporary.
Music is my love.
I am for sure a redhead and there aren't that many of us out there in music.
I sold my life to Capitol Records; it sucks.
Well, being a Canadian, I love SCTV, and I think it's the basis for all good North American comedy, so I compare everything to that.
I hate horror movies.
I don't like to be afraid. I'm afraid every day, all the time.
So, there's only so much you can do with a rock video.
I mean, the way I see it is, every penny I've ever made through music is free money.
I've made a life and career as a professional musician.
I made money. What am I gonna invest in? Stocks? No. I'm going to invest in music.
I love big budgeted, epic rock landscapes. That's what turns me on.
I don't want a record company, but I need one, unfortunately.
The intentions of record companies are not good, from the musician's perspective.
But everything you do in life has a downside.
I mean, I grew up with pretty down-to-earth, atheist parents, but I was born a Pisces.
As soon as I became old enough to make my dreams my reality, I became a firm believer that the subconscious and the world outside of our flesh and blood is essentially the truth.
