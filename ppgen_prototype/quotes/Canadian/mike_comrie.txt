To be honest with you, most of the times I have fought, there has been a reason.
We're not only hockey players. A lot of guys have families and girlfriends. You can't just think about hockey 24-7.
Playing 10 years in the NHL, almost 600 games, there's going to be some wear and tear for everybody.
I'd just like to be able to walk without pain or run without a limp.
I've seen where teams pay to get a player, like when Los Angeles paid to get Wayne Gretzky.
