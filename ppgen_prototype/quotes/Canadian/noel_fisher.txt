I'm just looking for good work. I just really love acting, and I'd like to jump on something that's really exciting for me.
Something that I really enjoy doing is creating and being a part of very different characters and very different projects.
The whole goal for me with my career is just follow good projects and good parts and challenge myself as much as I can.
I went through some tough years when I first moved to Los Angeles, and 'The Riches' was my first major success.
When I was a kid, my parents encouraged me to take many different classes. Piano was one that I really fell in love with.
I think you should check out 'Battle: Los Angeles' because it really is a sci-fi movie, but it's not. It's not like anything you've seen before. The best way to describe it is it's a war movie that happens to have aliens as the enemy.
'Hatfields & McCoys' is a very profound statement in what happens when you're unable to let go of hatred and hurt and unable to have any kind of goodness in your life.
