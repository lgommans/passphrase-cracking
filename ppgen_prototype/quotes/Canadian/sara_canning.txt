Canadian,Actress
I'm so fascinated with the study of people and why they are the way they are. That's my research and my archaeology, if you will, when I get a role. I'm so excited to attack a part from every angle of what makes a person a person.
I spent my childhood in Newfoundland and then my junior high and high school years in Alberta, Canada.
I was a really good student. I was nerdy and ambitious. I was involved with every large theater production at my school.
My first job ever was working a ski lift when I was 16. I also worked at a garden center, which I loved. I did that for two and a half years.
Everyone has always called me by my last name. Once people get to know me, they don't call me Sara anymore.
I definitely fell in love with 'Dracula' when I was 13. I found it so fascinating and so dark and romantic.
