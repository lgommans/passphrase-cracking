Canadian,Actress
You can still be strong and be feminine.
I have beauty, intelligence, individuality, sensuality and sexuality.
School seemed unimportant, since I learned so much more on my own.
I never really decided to be an actress, but I got an agent, was called back on every show I auditioned for, and finally decided I was meant to be an actress.
I realize I can never take my success for granted. It's not attractive for anyone to be like that.
