Canadian,Actor
I liked working on 'The Grudge 2.' It was really fun, and I got to meet a lot of cool people. I think the film is a fine example of horror, and I felt excited that I could act in something like that.
I like to think of myself as a 'live life to its fullest' type of guy.
I'm Canadian - I came from a small island off Vancouver. I moved to Vancouver and a couple months later moved to Los Angeles for work. It was very adventurous. It was kind of scary - I didn't know anybody.
I've had teachers that inspired me, yes. I think teachers play a really important role in people's lives. I had one teacher in particular who helped me through high school and really instilled a confidence in me by just holding me up to a standard I wasn't holding myself up to.
I think that all I can do is try and keep myself stress-free and away from any type of result-orientated thinking, and go and do my work and tell a story.
That's what people want to watch - somebody telling a story. So if you go in and tell a story that makes sense to them, that touches them, then they're going to watch; then they'll tell a friend and that type of thing. In terms of how many people are watching in a given week, it's more the advertiser's job, not mine.
