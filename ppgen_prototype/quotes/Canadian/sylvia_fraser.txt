To me, forgiveness is the cornerstone of healing.
My childhood was marked by seizures, which my family interpreted as temper tantrums.
It is one of the ironies of my life and in many lives that whenever you are the happiest, all of this stuff from the past will come pushing up and demand to be noticed.
