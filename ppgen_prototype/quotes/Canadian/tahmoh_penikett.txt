I love science fiction. I always have, ever since I was a kid. I love a lot of science fiction writers. William Gibson is one of my favorite writers.
When I was a kid, 'Blade Runner' was my favorite movie. I remember seeing that when I was a little boy with my dad.
I love science fiction when it's well-done. I don't like campy stuff. I don't like stuff that's too fantastical.
L.A.'s a great city in a lot of ways. There's a lot of great weather here. I know some good people.
Honestly, 'Battlestar' is a truly unique thing, and it's hard for anything to step up to that. There aren't often shows that are as good as that.
