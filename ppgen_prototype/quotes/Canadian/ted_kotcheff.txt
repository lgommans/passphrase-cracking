Canadian,Director
I have a bad reputation for being temperamental.
I'm not an easygoing guy as a director.
When you meet me, I can be charming and intelligent and reasonable.
But when I direct I become possessed, a possession I've never quite understood.
Everything about filmmaking tries to distract you from that first fine rapturous vision you have of the film.
When you're actually making the film, you're constantly battling to maintain its integrity.
Sylvester has a great popular sense, as good as any writer I've ever worked with. He knows what audiences want to see, and what they don't want to see.
My plan was to stay in Canada to make films.
I wanted to make Canadian films, and I ended up making American films.
I have as much artistic freedom in my television work as I have in my films.
