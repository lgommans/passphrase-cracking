After going to theater school, and then subsequently dropping out, I would say that when I first went to Chicago and learned long-form improv, that was a far better acting workshop than any acting school I've been to.
I don't think anyone can do any character that doesn't have at least some ounce of themselves in it. You are who you are, and your brain is drawing on things that you've experienced.
T.J. Miller and Kumail Nanjiani I met when I was in Chicago, learning how to do comedy.
I went to University of Victoria on Vancouver Island and their theater program.
I've always been a gamer. I play a version of Dungeons & Dragons.
You get a lot of apps and companies that are trying to sell you on something that's totally useless or potentially unhealthy. Only occasionally does something really worthwhile really come out.
I'm undeniably very nerdy, but I'm trying to recognize and pursue more masculine pursuits.
I was voted valedictorian, and at my school it wasn't based on grades; that was the popular vote.
Speaking as someone who's played a lot of video games, and at the end of the video game all you have is a memory, after woodworking you get this piece of furniture.
I've had the fortune of meeting most of the 'Kids in the Hall.' One meeting was special in particular because this was before I had gotten anything, before anything was clicking, and I just found myself hanging out with Scott Thompson.
Everything needs to be lampooned. I believe that there's not any sacred ground.
Chicago was where I realized that improv is its own thing, its own art form. And through that, you kind of develop a work ethic of not selling it short.
I make very basic country rustic furniture.
