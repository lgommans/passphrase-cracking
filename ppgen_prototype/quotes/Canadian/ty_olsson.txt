Canadian,Actor
I'm a bit of a goofball; I don't have a lot of censors and I don't have a lot boundaries and I'm trying to remember that the world is watching.
I entertain for a living and I role-play for a living, and I can't help but continue to do it.
I'm not sure whether it's good fortune or bad, but I've died many times on screen.
