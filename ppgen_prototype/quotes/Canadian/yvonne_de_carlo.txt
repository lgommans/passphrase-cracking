I guess I lead a double life, and I must admit I'm happy with both.
I enjoyed being in 'The Ten Commandments.' That was a great experience - to suddenly become one of those holy people. I was holier than thou.
I found I had the ability to do comedy. My timing was really inborn.
I was named Margaret Yvonne. 'Margaret' because my mother was very fond of one of the derivatives of the name. She was fascinated at the time by the movie star Baby Peggy, and I suppose she wanted a Baby Peggy of her own.
Men, no matter what their promises, rarely leave their spouses... the louses.
I'm from Hollywood; I'm too dumb to be nervous about New York.
After I made my hit in 'Salome,' Universal sent me to New York so I could learn to be a proper movie star.
