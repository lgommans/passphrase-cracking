Patton was living in the Dark Ages. Soldiers were peasants to him. I didn't like that attitude.
I was a born troublemaker and might as well earn a living at it.
I feel like a fugitive from the law of averages.
I would like to thank the people who encouraged me to draw army cartoons at a time when the gag man's conception of the army was one of mean ole sergeants and jeeps which jump over mountains.
I'm convinced that the infantry is the group in the army which gives more and gets less than anybody else.
