I think being beautiful is only one aspect of your life.
Beauty is only temporary, but your mind lasts you a lifetime.
A man is a man in every part of the world. It has nothing to do with race. It has to do with the culture and education that each man has received since he was a child, in his home. It has to do with how he was raised.
But as I was saying, from my experiences, I think men tend to be more timid in expressing their feelings for you. Regardless, I always prefer a friendship first and foremost.
BUT, in terms of attractiveness, speaking in terms of physical aspects only I think that Argentinean, Italian, Mexican, and Spanish men are among the most attractive men.
Every day I am trying to improve my life.
I know that people will remember me as Miss Universe because it was my first great achievement, but I still have my whole career ahead of me.
I would like to continue making music and acting in projects that give me a lot of satisfaction.
If you don't have talent or preparation for whatever you want to do, you will not be successful in anything.
There is no country that has the best men.
Well that's actually happened to me a couple of times... but I really think that men, when it comes to falling in love, are less... I guess you could say less aggressive.
Well, I think it's because I'm an only daughter. I have four brothers, a bunch of guy cousins, and so it's like I was raised amongst men. So I've always gotten along really well with men.
Women are a little more assertive in terms of our ability to express our feelings when we fall in love.
