Celebrity
Everything is for sale in Hollywood; the fairy tale, the costume, the pumpkin, the footman and the mice.
There is superficiality to Hollywood, and yes, it is charming. Of course there is sunshine, but there is also a dark side. It's a difficult place if you don't know people, and if you can't drive, you will find it lonely. You have to create your own bubble.
I'm learning to deal with my loneliness because then nobody can muck me around any more.
All my family were brilliant cooks when I was growing up, but I ended up just cleaning up, so I've always lacked confidence in the kitchen.
If I can't be happy, nobody can be happy.
My marriage started to go badly wrong after I had my second son.
I don't think I've ever come to terms with not having had a father around, and that's why I made so many mistakes with men.
Sometimes I think I've been too honest, and other times, too explicit.
My mother was an opera singer and my grandmother a concert pianist, and they only liked classical music. If I put on a pop record, they would tell me to turn it off, so I only listen to classical.
Most of the friends you trust are those you've known for 10 years.
Part of me is very shy.
In L.A., you seem to meet only one sort of person.
I wasn't very ambitious. I really wanted to get married.
If I could only have cash, I know that I would spend very little.
I like my privacy, and my personal bank manager is one of my favourite people.
I'm not keen on the Internet. I don't trust it.
In real life you are doomed if you believe in youth and money, but not here in Hollywood. Nothing is what it seems.
Tinseltown is eerily silent when The Oscars, The Emmys and The Grammys, The Sag Awards, and The Golden Globes aren't in full swing.
Every woman has, for her own self-esteem, to work or have a major interest.
I like to be free.
