I don't know why you would trade a stud pitcher.
But marriage goes in waves. You've got to be patient. People bail and give up on their marriages way too early. They just don't put the work and the effort into it. You've got to suck up your ego a lot of times, because that can be a big downfall.
Suddenly, I found I was married to a millionaire.
If you tell me I can't have something then that just makes me want it more.
We want to christen every city that Kris has played in during his professional career.
I'm very traditional, believe it or not. My daughters are not allowed to date until they're at least 16 and I'm going to make it 18 for the next one.
Right now, I have some big dreams. But at the same time, if I get annoyed and harassed by the media, I'll just quit. I don't care. We're set for life. I have quite a temper.
What I really see myself doing is late-night TV. No woman has ever done it.
I've always been a headstrong girl. I had my first child at 17, and it was a mistake, but I got a beautiful child out of it.
I am called a gold digger all the time. I don't care. There is nothing you can do about what other people say.
I want to do more television and I want to do more radio.
I don't want anyone seeing me naked.
