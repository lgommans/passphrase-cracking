Endless motorbike talk can and does bore me.
I decided there and then to sue the bastards.
They were ridiculous times. After I won my world championship in 1976, I went to Japan.
I race in two or three classic races a year and I may carry on for 10 more years or I may stop tomorrow.
I thought: This is not racing, it's a suicide mission.
It wasn't about the money. I just wanted them to admit it was their fault.
It's not as if there's a noise problem, because they use the same circuits as Formula One.
Nobody within motorcycling has or deserves any respect.
I vowed I would do everything I could to stop the Isle of Man counting towards the world championship. And it was stopped, so they love me in the Isle of Man.
I'd get to within a yard of that door you walk through and the thing would go mad. I used to carry an X-ray in my briefcase, to show them. But I had all the metal taken out.
