I've learned a lot about good and evil. They are not always what they appear to be.
I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception... I have deceived my friends - and I had millions of them.
Some of you read with me 40 years ago a portion of Aristotle's Ethics, a selection of passages that describe his idea of happiness. You may not remember too well.

I never wanted to see another quiz show.
My total winnings after 14 appearances were $129,000.
I worked hard at memorizing lists of facts and figures, and carried with me a book of facts.
I cannot take back one word or action; the past does not change for anyone.
I hoped that it would be possible to slide slowly from my public life back to the life of teaching and writing that I had always wanted. But things didn't work out that way.
