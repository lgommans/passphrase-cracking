Folks, this is perfect weather for today's game. Not a breath of air.
An announcer is only as good as yesterday's performance.
I never took myself too seriously.
I thought it was terrible. I don't know who to believe. Williams was very loyal and honest. Nobody could ever say different. Sometimes, that got him into a lot of trouble. But after he died and they cut his head off, that made me sick.
It wasn't like it is now. But for the types of teams we had, the fans were very good here. On some Thursday afternoon games, we'd get 25,000 fans. That was remarkable. This has always been a great Red Sox city.
Their future is ahead of them.
