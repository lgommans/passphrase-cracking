American,Celebrity
I know I want to help people and inspire people. That's my purpose in life.
I don't want fear or cancer to define me, but it's always in the back of your mind.
Cancer isn't going to slow me down.
I don't know if anything can really prepare you for 'Survivor,' but since I grew up as an athlete, the physical aspect came to me more easily.
I don't think 'Survivor' really changed me.
Soccer is my life.
If I can make an impact, I want to help some kids and bridge the gap between soccer and celebrity in America.
My hair is my identity.
