It was one long, anxious, inexorable, eternal vigil.
I have been hunted for twenty-one years. I have literally lived in the saddle. I have never known a day of perfect peace.
I was tired of an outlaw's life.
We sometime didn't get enough to buy oats for our horses. Most banks had very little money in them.
When I slept it was literally in the midst of an arsenal. If I heard dogs bark more fiercely than usual, or the feet of horses in a greater volume of sound than usual, I stood to arms.
