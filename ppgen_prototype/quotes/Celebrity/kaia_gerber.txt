Living in Malibu is like being in a bubble, so discovering others that are so different from me has been incredibly gratifying.
People expect you to be doing something cool all the time. In a normal life, that's not happening!
If you only share your best pictures, or your Facetuned self, the thought of people seeing you as you truly are can be scary.
Unless they're superhuman, nobody's going to look perfect all the time.
I love the look of full brows that aren't perfectly done - eyebrows on fleek: that's the goal.
My mom does mine because I know I would go tweezer-crazy and wind up with no eyebrows at all.
She told me that she would support me regardless of what I decided, but I'm so glad that I actually got to be a kid before having to grow up. My mom knows best about this kind of thing.
A lot of people ask me what my mom has taught me about modeling. The truth is the things she teaches me go deeper than what pose to make or what my good side is.
Bruce Weber is an amazing photographer, and Carine Roitfeld's style - and everything she does - is gorgeous.
I really look up to Karlie Kloss.
She teaches me to be kind, punctual... and to stand up for myself. And when I think about it, aren't these things every mother should teach their daughter?
