As soon as I get on my boat, something inside me changes. Then I really feel what living is.
I follow my own head. And if I'm determined to do something, then I'll make sure that I make it happen.
At sea, I feel comfortable and I come to rest.
When I'm not surfing or sailing, I am to be found at the harbour working on my boat.
I grew up sailing in the North Sea.
It was really weird dealing with the media. I had no idea how to handle it.
A house is kind of scary.
I really like boats. If you want to go somewhere, you just take your house with you.
I do not often get lonely, and I never get bored.
I love my parents. But they have their life, and I have mine.
I want simply to learn about the world and live freely.
Since I was 10 years old, I knew I wanted to sail around the world.
Over a period of 11 months, I was constantly afraid that Youth Care would lock me up. It was all a frightening and traumatic experience. So often, these terrible memories come to me. I can't ignore them.
I am not going to say much about the film 'Maidentrip,' but I won't be representing it, as I am not fully standing behind it.
I was four when I first stood at the helm on my own.
I'm still not used to the idea of being the youngest circumnavigator.
As a 13-year-old girl, it was never my intention to be the center of world news.
My parents have sailed around the world; they know what can happen and that it's not always fun, but because I want to do it so much, they agreed and supported me.
In England, I met a couple who run a children's home. They were very kind and showed me many nice spots in England.
All the media are horrible.
