There's a rule of thumb in politics. If you're at a point where you're complaining about the other guy being mean and unfair and uncivil, that's probably a sign that you're losing.
Incredible that liberals aren't more concerned about the monopoly of information in South Dakota.
South Dakota is a great state because of its values, not because of dependence on government.
Well I think that, if you want to look at polarizing people right now, I wouldn't look at Palin, I'd look at Barack Obama.
But to say that Sarah Palin and the tea party movement is responsible for vandalism or threats is just a way to dismiss the American people and, and their dissatisfaction with this health care bill.
Well I think that what we're seeing now is that the people feel like they, the people in Congress don't have their consent to govern them. They keep doing things that are incredibly unpopular. And so when that happens, folks get angry.
The more vile the thing that's said about me, the less it affects me. It doesn't bother me at all.
Our country is in deep trouble. To talk and re-litigate in 1998, or even what Mitt Romney said or didn't say in 1994 or 2002, I don't think most people really care.
Solutions-oriented campaigning with a little passion and a little humor; I think that will go a long way. I think people are desperate for it.
