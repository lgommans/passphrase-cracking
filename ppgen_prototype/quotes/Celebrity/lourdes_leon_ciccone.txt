I have a lot of people judging my every move. It's important for me to not let it rule my life.
I love when someone doesn't pretend to be someone they are not.
My mom definitely inspires me. She's just crazy when it comes to her fashion sense.
My mom doesn't fit into my shoes, so sucks for her!
I used to look at the outfits that I wore when I was 11, and I was like, 'That's really ugly.' I mean, I just thought I was the coolest kid ever and actually wasn't.
