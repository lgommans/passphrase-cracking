At the time I attempted to purchase the rights back for the 3 Homestead records, but the owner demanded an outrageous sum in the neighborhood of $10,000, about 10 times more money than I could get my hands on at the time.
Cleveland is the place I grew up and lived much of my adult life, so it will always be a part of my soul.
Each of my records has a different focus, a different theme.
I also spend a lot of time on political blogs, and music blogs getting things for my radio show.
I am pretty detached from the local music crowd though.
I followed most of the 80's bands into the 90's as most of those folks who hadn't moved away were all still active. However, there was a point when I lost track of the new bands coming up.
I have always abhorred the business end of music.
I pretty much ignored politics all through my 20's and 30's... I had other things on my mind... the band, finding a meaningful relationship, getting enough money to eat and pay the rent.
I probably had the most fun recording For Richer For Poorer in Nashville.
In my mid 30's, after a decade or so of giving full time to the music thing and finding myself with about $10 in the bank and no assets other than my musical equipment, I realized I needed to get serious about making a living.
The turning point for me was when the Supreme Court installed Bush in 2000, even though he got half a million votes less nationally than Gore. It was nothing more than a bloodless coup and that's when I really started paying attention.
There's nothing remotely interesting to me about marketing music as a product.
They lyrical content has grown more introspective and less abstract. I don't know if that's good or bad... Sometimes it feels a little raw to be putting so much of myself out there.
To me, all war is failure for humanity, though it often is a bounty for commerce.
You can't get away from who you are I guess.
