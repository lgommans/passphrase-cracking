Japanese,Celebrity
The simple hearth of the small farm is the true center of our universe.
Ignorance, hatred and greed are killing nature.
As we kill nature, we are killing ourselves, and God incarnate as the world as well.
There is no time in modern agriculture for a farmer to write a poem or compose a song.
