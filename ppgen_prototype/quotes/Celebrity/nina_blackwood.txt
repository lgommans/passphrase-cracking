American,Celebrity
I am like the little rock n' roll backseat driver.
I grew up in Ohio, and I was a musicologist since I was little; it is all that I would ever read.
When you are young your imagination is so clear.
We put all these things together into a tangible product that is The Rock N' Roll Mystery Tour.
Absolute 80's is three hours of mainstream 80's music. I also do New Wave Nation that is more cutting edge. It is more punk stuff from the 70's to the 90's.
I have two syndicated radio shows though United Stations Radio Network.
I was in the pilot for Spinal Tap before it was a movie.
Christopher Guest movies are my top of the line favorites.
I could not do the film Spinal Tap because I was already at MTV and it was occupying all my time.
I get real excited when I hear my shows on the radio.
I worked with three people who were doing video music shows before MTV.
First of all, you needed a budget to do the video. The record companies would pick and choose who got videos.
The heyday of video music was the mid 80's.
Interviewing people is pretty natural for me.
I am a curious person and, believe it or not, I really do like to sit back and listen to people's stories.
My reading is always about musical biographies. I have an innate interest and passion for that.
The hardest and worst interview that I have ever done was with Frank Zappa.
When I worked for Entertainment Tonight I got to emcee Paul McCartney's press conference.
Now that the 90's are over and more time has gone by, the 80's sound fresh again.
People that really know me will tell you that I am not a video vixen.
Because I was the blonde, I was promoted as the video vixen.
The thing that they were more freaked out was that I had done a spread for Playboy years before, and as Playboy always does, they exploit the exploitation and re-release different pictures.
I'm a little bit to the left of things anyway.
