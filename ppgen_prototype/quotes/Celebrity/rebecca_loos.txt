I am not trying to give an image of a fairytale, perfect, everything else, I am just being myself.
I got a phone call saying we are from the News of the World, and we're exposing you and David Beckham. My heart did not beat for a minute.
I was reading so much about myself in the papers that was not me.
I wanted to step forward and be on TV and for people to see who I really was.
I did not know what my future was going to hold.
I am utterly in love with my son and my boyfriend and live in the most magical place on Earth. I've been in Norway for ten months now and I have loved every minute of it.
I wanted control over what was said and what was not said, rather than holding my head down in shame.
I'm a new mum who spends her days making baby food and cooking for her man. And I couldn't be happier.
Don't get me wrong - I love London, and still have an apartment there.
