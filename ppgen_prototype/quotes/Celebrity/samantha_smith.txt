God made the world for us to live together in peace and not fight.
He said that if we were going to have a war, they would never be the first ones to start it.
If you aren't please tell me how you are going to not have a war.
Sometimes I still worry that the next day will be the last day of the Earth.
And he said that he didn't want to have a war or anything like that again.
Well, I asked him who would start the war first.
Well, I just hope we can have peace, and I hope it'll do some good.
