Irish,Celebrity
There can be only one Captain to a ship.
Character is better than ancestry, and personal conduct is of more importance than the highest.
Only disaster can follow divided counsels and opposing wills.
The work to me is everything, and I would throw every rule overboard and send them to the bottom of the sea tomorrow, if I felt there were a more excellent way.
