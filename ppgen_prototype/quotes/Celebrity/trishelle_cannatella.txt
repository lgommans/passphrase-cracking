American,Celebrity
I've always liked Playboy; I think it's very tasteful.
Theo does comedy now, and he's traveling around the country doing comedy, and I actually just saw him, he's from Louisiana, and I just saw him when I went home to visit my family in Louisiana. I saw his comedy show and he was brilliant.
I went to college in Mississippi; I'm from Louisiana.
And I have a couple swimsuit calendars I did that are coming out.
And I'm auditioning right now for a movie, and then I have a script that I'm reading right now for a horror film, and I'm meeting for a couple of television shows that I just had yesterday, and pretty much was offered one of them.
But Tammy Faye calls me, and Ron Jeremy calls me, Erik Estrada sends me a Christmas card every year.
I tried out for another show while I was in college so I could pay off my student loans, and it sort of led to The Real World. The same people that were casting that show were casting The Real World, so they asked me to do it.
I want to try out for Playmate actually. I talked to one of the photographers about doing test shots.
I would like to host a show, something like travel or cooking or something like that, something I'm really interested in, and so I'm pitching a couple television shows.
I'd like to be an assistant producer to a reality show.
I'm on the cover of the lingerie football swimsuit calendar this year.
So yeah, but from the show and as far as MTV I have a lot of friends, and from the challenges and the other shows, that I've met. I currently don't have any enemies that I know of.
Because I just like sports, I like athletics and I like competition.
