Cakes are special. Every birthday, every celebration ends with something sweet, a cake, and people remember. It's all about the memories.
Everybody likes pizza! It's a quick and easy clean-up meal.
No matter what the recipe, any baker can do wonders in the kitchen with some good ingredients and an upbeat attitude!
I promised my daughter I'd name my first restaurant after her, but now the other kids are like, 'Dad, what about us?' I'm gonna have to open four restaurants!
The key to a good meal is simplicity and the right seasoning.
I love making cakes, and I'm good at it.
Having family time to reflect on your day is the best.
I would never talk bad about anybody, even if they have something derogatory to say about me. I'm the bigger person.
You can tell when a girl went out of her way to look good.
My kids are always in the kitchen with me - I bring them to the bakery and let them decorate cakes, and they also try to help me and my wife, Lisa, cook dinner at night.
I think good things happen to good people.
You always help out a local businessperson.
I would love to sit at home all day and play with my kids. It's my favorite thing to do in my time off.
All of my family is so close. We're always over at each other's houses.
Oh, my wife is a wonderful cook. She comes from a food-loving Italian family - her father owned a pizzeria!
I get along with everybody.
