Chilean,Soldier
I'm not a dictator. It's just that I have a grumpy face.
I regret and suffer those losses, but it's God's will. He will pardon me if I committed excesses, but I don't think I did.
Everything I did, all my actions, all of the problems I had I dedicate to God and to Chile, because I kept Chile from becoming Communist.
Sometimes democracy must be bathed in blood.
During 65 years, I have walked the path of duty and discipline... And today, looking back at that long path of service, my soldier's heart stirs and murmurs from deep within: Thank you. Thank you, my homeland.
