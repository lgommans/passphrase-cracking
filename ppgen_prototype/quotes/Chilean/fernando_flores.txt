I never blamed Pinochet, or my torturers, or external circumstances.
I never told a victim story about my imprisonment. Instead, I told a transformation story - about how prison changed my outlook, about how I saw that communication, truth, and trust are at the heart of power.
You have to be able to risk your identity for a bigger future than the present you are living.
That's why we're doing this, to defend our traditions a little. I don't have anything against it (Halloween), but it's not our tradition.
