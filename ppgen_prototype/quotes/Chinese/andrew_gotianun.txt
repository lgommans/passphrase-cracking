Chinese,Businessman
Be fair in all your dealings, may it be in your family or in your business. At the end of it all, what matters is not how much money you make but how honest you are.
Do things fairly, especially with your children. Girls deserve equal opportunities, especially in getting educated as well as equal sharing in business.
There's one thing very important to me in business and for the long-term: always be honest with people. For the past 60 years, I always pay my debts.
I started with no money. I had to borrow money in the beginning. I'm always a dreamer. I dream and envision what to do, then my wife will help me realize those dreams. I always conceptualize.
