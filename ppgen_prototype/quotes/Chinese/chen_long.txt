Chinese,Athlete
For me, if I attack two or three times but didn't get the point, then I would get nervous.
I should play more quickly, more attacking.
I put pressure on myself.
I'm the world number one, so everyone is trying to attack me and trying to speed up.
Irrespective of who's up against me at tournaments, I have always relied completely on my own strengths to get as far as I can, and tried to adapt my game according to the match-situation.
Hamdan Sports Complex is an amazing venue, and I think all the players will love it.
I'm really eager to play the BWF Destination Dubai World Superseries Finals, especially after my enjoyable visit to the city.
There is a battle between me and Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei. We always do our best.
I am just focusing on one match at a time.
Maybe I have to be more aggressive.
Jorgensen is tough, but Lin Dan is right up there. He is the best and biggest rival. I really want to catch all his records, but if I want to achieve that, then the most important thing for me is to stay healthy.
We're all from China, and whoever wins, it's OK - I just try my best.
These days, men's singles is very hard. If you lose the first, you might lose everything.
It doesn't matter if you are number one or number two. You have to prepare for everything.
All that matters is that China wins the finals, and not which one will be playing.
