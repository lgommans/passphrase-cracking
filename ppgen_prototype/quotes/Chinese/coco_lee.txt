Chinese,Musician
I myself never feel that I'm sexy. If people call me cute, I am happier.
I'm sporty, active, bubbly, I like to make people laugh... I'm the jokester. But I'm also very traditional.
My mom was very strict when I was growing up. I could not talk to boys until I was 18. I had to study and work hard.
I was bred and raised in a multi-cultural music background.
I'm still a, you know, a silly girl... a big kid.
I love to prove people wrong. They expect I'll sound a certain way when they see me, then they hear me and they can't believe it. I love that.
They really can't imagine what my voice is like. Every time I sing a song, they are very surprised.
People have to respect intellectual property.
I wanted to bring the R&B flavor and other Westernized sounds to my music, because that's the type of music I grew up listening to.
When I work, I work. I don't think about anything else. I just wanna get the work done. And I'm a perfectionist.
I'm proud of my roots. There are not many Asians in the music industry so it's important for me to tell people where I'm from.
I'm not a businessperson. I have no sense of money. My mom does everything for me. She makes all my decisions for me, and even buys my clothes. She's very protective.
