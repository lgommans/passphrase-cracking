Chinese,Poet
This morning's scene is good and fine, Long rain has not harmed the land.
My heart is in a world of water and crystal, My clothes are damp in this time of spring rains.
The weeping voices rise straight up and strike the clouds. A passer-by at the roadside asks a conscript why, The conscript answers only that drafting happens often.
This cream will help one's nature strengthen and grow, The diet gives support in my decline.
