There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness.
I really can't hate more than 5 or 10 years. Wouldn't it be terrible to be always burdened with those primary emotions you had at one time?
Love from one being to another can only be that two solitudes come nearer, recognize and protect and comfort each other.
