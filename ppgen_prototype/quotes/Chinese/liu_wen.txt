Chinese,Model
Romantic music really stirs my soul. And, of course, I love Chinese music; it makes me feel closer to home.
My hometown is a very boring city. There isn't a lot of industry - there are a lot of trees. It's not like Beijing where the sky is always dark. In my city the sky is blue and the sun shines.
I'm not that big a celebrity. I'm just an ordinary person.
Striped shirts and printed shorts, jeans, and trousers are all items I buy and wear a lot in my private life.
Fashion is a good job for a young girl. I like clothes - I like to play with clothes. I like DIY; I like to make outfit.
I have lots of vintage clothes.
My favourite city is Miami. It's very fresh and the beach is sunny.
I used to see Estee Lauder's ads everywhere in the subways of Beijing, and I thought how wonderful it would be if the model on them was myself!
The first time at Louis Vuitton was Spring 2009 season, and I remember that the colors of the clothes were very dreamy.
My parents are very humble people who have simple lives... they live in a pleasant little town in China.
No one else in my family works in the fashion industry.
Every makeup artist or stylist with whom I work has many special ideas, tips, and creations. I can always learn so much from them.
I collect a lot of eco-friendly shopping bags that serve to separate my shoes other and other small stuff in my luggage.
When I'm studying English I love to watch 'Friends' or 'Nikita.'
I don't use any makeup if I'm not doing work.
I never wore high heels in my hometown.
In my school days, everyone thought I'm too tall for a Chinese girl.
