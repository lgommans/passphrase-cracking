Glory is attained from hard work, step by step.
Playing on the Burj Al Arab helipad was an unforgettable experience, and the view of Dubai was incredible.
We are a motivated team, and there is nothing that can stop us from winning the title. Even if I had lost, my teammates would have made up for it.
This gold medal, to me, is a very good outcome from the many years I've spent on my professional career.
No matter who I meet, I won't have any pressure.
I just want to do my job.
I have to throw off the burden and the pressure.
It was a great privilege for me and my teammates to follow in the footsteps of sporting greats like Roger Federer and Tiger Woods.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the gold medal. It's a special moment in my career.
I am very glad not only to complete the grand slam, but to become Olympic champion alone makes me happy.
To win a gold medal at Olympic Games has long been my dream ever since I started my career as a table tennis player.
I am very happy my Olympic dream has come true.
