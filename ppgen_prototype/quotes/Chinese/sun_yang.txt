Chinese,Athlete
Around the world, when China has good results, people always think something bad.
We are training as hard as all athletes in other countries.
Sometimes we make a mistake. Don't treat us as the enemy.
There are indeed people with ulterior motives who don't wish Chinese swimming well; they even don't wish Asian swimming well. We cannot let these people's plans succeed.
You can imagine how hard it is, but there's always a force that pushes me forward to do all I can!
I am happy with my confidence level.
I think I will have an edge over my rivals in terms of confidence and experience.
To me I treat each of my events as something to enjoy.
I just need to focus on myself. I think nobody should focus on others, whether they actually have a problem with Chinese swimming or not.
1500 metre. I am the king.
I've done whatever it takes to prove I am a clean athlete.
