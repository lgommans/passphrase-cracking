Chinese,Businessman
Connections and relationships are important everywhere, anywhere - of course in China, because the rule of law it is not as strong as in the West, so a lot would rely on personal relationships.
I don't believe I want to retire, because I just enjoy and love my work so much.
I like to learn about things. I could learn about business, which I knew nothing about. Since the age of 7, I wanted to be a doctor and nothing else.
