Chinese,Businessman
One of the beauties of B2B is that there is a finite number of customers. So the marketing costs are much different. You don't have to take out Super Bowl ads or plaster the New York subway system.
The way China is looking to boost consumer spending is astounding. They are going to boost the minimum wage by 13 percent a year every year for five years... I don't know if people realize how dramatic that is.
I'm not an Internet guy - I'm a business guy.
