The hardest people to reach with the love of God are not the bad people. They know they are bad. They have no defense. The hardest ones to win for God are the self-righteous people.
When you say a situation or a person is hopeless, you are slamming the door in the face of God.
Remember that you are needed. There is at least one important work to be done that will not be done unless you do it.
Why should you be content with so little? Why shouldn't you reach out for something big?
The Christian is not one who has gone all the way with Christ. None of us has. The Christian is one who has found the right road.
Sometimes life has a way of putting us on our backs to force us to look up.
