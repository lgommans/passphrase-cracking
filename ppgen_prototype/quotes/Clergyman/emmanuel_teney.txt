Murder is not the crime of criminals, but that of law-abiding citizens.
As your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control, that things will flow as they will, and that you will flow with them, to your great delight and benefit.
There are no guarantees. From the viewpoint of fear, none are strong enough. From the viewpoint of love, none are necessary.
