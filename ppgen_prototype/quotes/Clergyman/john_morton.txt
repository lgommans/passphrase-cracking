There is no limit to the power of loving.
I'm 99 today and I'll be 100 tomorrow. It's another day.
The choice that you, as a Soul, have in relation to anything is always to be loving. Do you understand that this is the divine purpose that all of us as humans have been given - to love unconditionally?
I'm grateful I've got my mind. I can take care of my own business.
The history of trying to start a daily where there already is one is that it has never worked.
