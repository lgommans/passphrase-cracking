I believe that life is a journey towards God, and that no one has the right to insist that you go a certain road.
I can find God in nature, in animals, in birds and the environment.
I believe that there may be intelligent life on other planets.
There is no one true church.
The only sexual act that is sinful is the one that uses or abuses.
Religion can be both good and bad - it is spirituality that counts.
No man is infallible.
I hold that religion and faith are two different things.
I believe that the whole human race is the family of God.
I believe that sex is good and so is the body.
I believe that in this world it is impossible to understand God.
I believe that I am only at a beginning, only knocking at a door, and I believe that the best is yet to come.
I believe that God made this wonderful universe and all that exists.
I believe that God and reality are too big for my poor words.
I believe that dogma is often evil.
I believe that all men and women will be saved.
I believe in the power of weakness.
I believe in the freedom of God's sons and daughters.
I believe in people, especially suffering people.

All churches and all religions contain aspects of the truth, but only God is truth.
A Buddhist or a good atheist is as acceptable to God as a good Catholic.
