I don't think anything is unrealistic if you believe you can do it.
The undertaking of a new action brings new strength.
Children will not remember you for the material things you provided but for the feeling that you cherished them.
Don't let life discourage you; everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was.
Keep courage. Whatever you do, do not feel sorry for yourself. You will win in a great age of opportunity.
