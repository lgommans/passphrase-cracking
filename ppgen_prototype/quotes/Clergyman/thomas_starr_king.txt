American,Clergyman
What a year to live in! Worth all other times ever known in our history or any other.
I know it is all right. I wish I could make you feel so, I wish I could describe my feelings.
Do not weep for me.
What a privilege it is to be an American!
Though I weigh only 120 pounds, when I'm mad, I weigh a ton.
I pledged California to a Northern Republic and to a flag that should have no treacherous threads of cotton in its warp, and the audience came down in thunder.
The Man Without a Country, was an orator no one could silence and no one could answer.
It is strange. I see all the privileges and greatness of the future. It already looks grand, beautiful. Tell them I went lovingly, trustfully, peacefully.
