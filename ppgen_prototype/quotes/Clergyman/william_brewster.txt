English,Clergyman
We gather for prayer, and reading the Bible, and singing the songs of David.
I discipline churchgoers with godly lessons and sharp words if they do not change their ways. My goal is to open their hearts so that they seek forgiveness.
We follow the rules laid out in the Bible for running our church.
In the morning on Sunday, a drum is sounded at about 8 o'clock.
