American,Coach
I have never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a successful season.
If you think my career has been a failure because I have never won a national title, you have another thing coming.
I never brought it up when I coached, but I have close ties at Ohio State. Unfortunately, I even have a graduate degree from there.
A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan.
