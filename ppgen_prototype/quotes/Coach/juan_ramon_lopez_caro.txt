Spanish,Coach
I have repeatedly said that success requires concerted efforts and support of the fans.
For me all games are finals.
It's not easy to play a match every two days.
Real Madrid is a great club, and I will have some great players at my disposal who all want to help improve the level of the team.
The fans have a fundamental part to play at the club and their support has to be the foundation of everything.
