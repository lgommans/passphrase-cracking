American,Coach
I've cut my teeth as a coach with some great head coaches and some great co-workers and I have been very lucky to have learned a lot of football from all of the above.
I thought last week's game was ugly and this was even uglier.
It's a shame anyone had to lose that. What a great rivalry.
I've always learned when you win a game, no matter what the stats look like, you have to enjoy the victories because they are hard to come by.
I don't really ever worry about what anyone else does and I certainly don't worry about what anyone else says about me.
I don't have that same ambition I had when I was younger.
