The key to winning is poise under stress.
When you win, say nothing. When you lose, say less.
A winner never whines.
You can learn a line from a win and a book from a defeat.
Football is a game of errors. The team that makes the fewest errors in a game usually wins.
What we have currently available is what we have available.
