American,Comedian
I don't get offered many dramatic roles. As soon as my face pops up in a movie, everyone knows I'm the funny guy.
I missed the boat when I was doing Late Night.
Somehow, by just continually pestering the general public by appearing on television, they accepted me and wanted more.
But I don't think I was ever destined to be a big star.
I think the whole idea of me was that I wasn't going to be but that I wanted to be, desperately.
That's what keeps me up at three in the morning: Who's looking at reviews of Cabin Boy right now?
I'm not a competitive person.
