English,Comedian
I met my wife, Doreen, who was a dancer in the show.
In 1958, we decided to go to Australia. We were there for six months, and all the shows went well.
Things really began to move for us. In 1953 I could afford to marry Doreen.
We became Morris and Morecambe. This partnership did not last long, however.
We took the whole thing far too seriously. After all, those were early days in television.
