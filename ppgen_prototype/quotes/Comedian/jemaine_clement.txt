New Zealander,Comedian
I'm part Maori. My mum's Maori, and she raised me. And my grandma, she's Maori.
I can only think of one wacky best friend who I thought was awesome: Rhys Ifans in 'Notting Hill.' He really nailed the wacky best friend.
In real life I'm very low-key. A wallflower. One of the reasons I went into comedy and acting was that I was sick of being shy.
Well, I grew up in the '80s, which was a really massive time for sci-fi.
What do I think of L.A.? It's boring, with some amazing nuggets. Like there are some parts of it that are great, but by and large I think it's quite boring.
