So the laughs had to come from the character, not because we had balloons in our shirts or were speaking in high voices. That was very important to us.
We always thought that we'd go on from the show to have a career in movies.
We never thought the first movie would bomb.
We end the show with something that's never been on TV because it was too big for a sketch but we couldn't stretch it out to make a whole episode because it would have been too long, but we always thought it was really good.
Anything that was perverse and silly would be Kids in the Hall.
What I always say is that we're the illegitimate children of Andy Kaufman and Jerry Lewis.
Of course Toronto might as well be Buffalo, because we get each other's TV.
We're doing 3,000 seaters before that we never played anything more than 1,000.
Oh, completely liberating because even if you don't do a woman right, you just have to put on high heels a wig, a bra and a dress, and I feel liberated.
I feel that I'm sort of playing me but more feminine, and to me more feminine means smarter.
Well... Actually I got picked because I was the only one who fit the wedding gown - they had my size.
I can't explain it, but spiritually it makes sense - though I don't understand how it does make sense.
I had to learn how to drive because I didn't drive in Toronto.
You know, I've never seen South Park, just by coincidence.
I would also would have liked the part of the Bus Driver.
He sort of gets comic moments. Not a lot of directors do.
Yes, they allowed us to play around a lot because, like we said, the director's such a good comedy director.
And we know Bruce Campbell from way back, so that was a lot of fun.
