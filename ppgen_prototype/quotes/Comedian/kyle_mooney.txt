American,Comedian
I've always been kind of deep into thrifting and secondhand clothing.
'Nathan for You' was my first time being in a writer's room, really.
I guess I always have been a collector.
I am the youngest of three boys, and I was super-informed by what the older ones were into.
I feel like I've got a pretty relatively extensive Christmas sweatshirt collection.
I still watch TGIF shows like 'Family Matters.'
A lot of my characters are people who are, in essence, lying to themselves. They present one thing, when in reality they're another thing. Maybe they're not as tough or as cool as they want to be.
It's always exciting to create a character that people can relate to, where people are like, 'Oh, I know this dude,' but maybe you've never actually seen this type of character on TV.
Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, Dava Carvey, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell - they're all the best.
Whenever anybody says what you do isn't good, it's always unflattering and makes me feel uncomfortable. But when the person who's in charge of the United States of America says, 'Not good,' I'm like, 'Oh.' It's a little unflattering.
Generally, I'm attracted to videos that hit me some way nostalgically.
The Christian kids' movies are fun because so many of them are made with low production value, but they're still trying to appeal to a broad audience like a Sesame Street or something. It's always fascinating to see how hidden or obvious they want to make their message. Also, the acting in them can be pretty fun.
I'm always pretty influenced by stuff from when we were younger.
