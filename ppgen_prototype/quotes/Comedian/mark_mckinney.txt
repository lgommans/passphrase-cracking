I'm nutty bunny number two. I love me and I love you.
What? No one wants my bouquet! Somebody better pick it up! Somebody better pick up my bouquet!
I'm a little thirsty, can I go drink out of your toilet?

Oh, and Scott, get Mark to play me. He's the most talented one anyway.
Two stops after I got on, these two unbelievable short people got on, and the way they were looking at me, I could tell. They wanted to bite my ankles!

You don't go dancing in the day. You don't go golfing in the night.
Then my uncle would give off the smell of freshly baked bread which I love.
