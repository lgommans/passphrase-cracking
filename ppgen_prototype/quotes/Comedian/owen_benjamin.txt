American,Comedian
To be fair, I don't get mad when people laugh at me when I fall down.
I was 6, and I was in the opera 'Carmen.' My dad sang opera and got me into the children's chorus. I was super fat at the time and didn't make eye contact with anyone. I knew I loved acting ever since.
I have a ton of videos on MySpace and YouTube.
