English,Comedian
I liked playing Morph in Mash and Peas and doing Phil Daniels in the Blur Rock Profile was a giggle too.
I just want to keep creating stuff, work regularly and learn how to use a computer properly.
I remember going to my school careers advisor and asked about jobs that required scuba divers. It was a phase.
I wear so many disguises on the show that only a real comedy fan might spot me.
