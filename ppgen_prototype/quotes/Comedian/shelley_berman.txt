American,Comedian
As a culture I see us as presently deprived of subtleties. The music is loud, the anger is elevated, sex seems lacking in sweetness and privacy.
The old problems - love, money, security, status, health, etc. - are still here to plague us or please us.
Unquestionably, standup comedy is and has always been an art form.
I believe it is important for comedians to know who came before them.
My whole act is confession.
Incidentally, I'm still looking for acting work, my first love.
So that this thing that aired in 1963 would result a few years later in personal bankruptcy, would result in having people be on edge with me, wondering when I'm going to blow up.
Inside was the second LP album of a comedian's performance before an audience.
I was an actor before becoming a comedian.
I am presently in my thirteenth year of teaching a graduate course at the University of Southern California.
Outside came in '60. The Edge in '61. All three made Gold, but the biggest seller was Inside.

I quit smoking well over twenty years ago.
The Steve Allen Sunday night show had the right to two options after my first performance.
My first job was at a Chicago night club called Mr. Kelly's.
I am careful with my material and presentation.
The most memorable performance was my appearance in concert in Carnegie Hall. The first standup to do so.
I am in the Master of Professional Writing program teaching Humor Writing, Literary and Dramatic.
As much experience, education and awareness as one can attain is important for a comedian.
I will always love to perform standup comedy.
While you're improvising, you may come up with something which will break him up. As soon as that smile comes out, you know that, hey, we're having fun.
