British,Comedian
So I turned these sort of deficiencies into a, a workable thing if you understand what I mean.
And erm, perhaps looking like this it was perhaps the only thing I could do.
It's both funny and sad which seem to me to be the two basic ingredients of good comedy.
We try to... we are, I suppose to a certain extent all affected and erm, that is both funny and sad I think.
I don't think I gain anything by seeing myself.
