Polish,Composer
I don't like the word 'experiment' in the context of art in general. It implies something immature, unfinished, something entertaining for a moment before it becomes irrelevant.
I wrote my first piano piece when I was in 4th grade.
Growing up in Poland, I didn't have the experience of going to Disneyland as a child, so I don't have any childhood memories connected to it, good or bad.
I always try not to overload my music with orchestration and to use only those instruments that are absolutely necessary.
My music lives because of real players.
