It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.
All the world loves a clown.
In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking but now, God knows, anything goes.
Good authors, too, who once knew better words now only use four-letter words writing prose... anything goes.
I love Paris in the summer, when it sizzles.
My sole inspiration is a telephone call from a director.
Most gentlemen don't like love, they just like to kick it around.
He may have hair upon his chest but, sister, so has Lassie.
