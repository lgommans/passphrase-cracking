American,Composer
I used to perform all the time but I haven't performed in New York in a very long time.
My background was in performing originally.
I decided during my teens that I wasn't going to have the life of a concert pianist, much to the chagrin of a lot of people who had put a lot of money into me!
So I went into jazz and performed in jazz clubs all over the country.
I have a bunch of albums I would love to get re-released.
I'm trying to get hold of them... the trouble is a lot of the companies that recorded and produced the albums went bust, so I don't know where to get the masters.
Since I was the solo artist as well as the writer for the songs, I figured I had enough credits on it already.
We're doing a workshop over the first two weeks of December, I believe, with Graciella Daniele directing it.
When I was four years old, my mother owned some tenements in the Bronx.
Someone skipped on the rent and they left behind a huge upright piano, which got moved into our apartment so the other apartment could get rented out. I took to it and started playing.
I'm lucky to be in a profession where you can keep getting better.
To put it in musician's terms, my chops are good.
