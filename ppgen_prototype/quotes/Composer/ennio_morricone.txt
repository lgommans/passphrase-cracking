Italian,Composer
I was offered a free villa in Hollywood, but I said no thank you, I prefer to live in Italy.
It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces.
There was a theft! But, of course, if it was up to me, every two years I would win an Oscar.
You can see my decision as either a distinctive factor or as a limitation. I don't feel it is a limitation.
Bernard Herrmann used to write all his scores by himself. So did Bach, Beethoven and Stravinsky. I don't understand why this happens in the movie industry.
I come from a background of experimental music which mingled real sounds together with musical sounds.
I also used these realistic sounds in a psychological way. With The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I used animal sounds - as you say, the coyote sound - so the sound of the animal became the main theme of the movie.
