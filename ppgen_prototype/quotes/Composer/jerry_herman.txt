I'm trying to bring a new generation into the musical theater and to create a new audience.
I don't want the kind of theater that I love and grew up seeing to die out.
I have a lot of friends who get up most mornings and go to jobs they absolutely hate. I don't think that's what life is about and I'm so fortunate that I actually love what I do.
