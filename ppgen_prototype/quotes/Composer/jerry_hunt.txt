My mother says I was vaccinated with a phonograph needle. I love to talk. I just love to talk.
In 1955 music wasn't that important. Music was a kind of a special thing you went and did.
I don't think I could have ever had a career as a pianist because I never ever wanted to play the notes the way they were written, I was too sloppy to learn them quite right.
I taught myself to play the piano. I've always been able to play, the minute I could get my hands up. I've always wanted to play the piano. It's the only instrument I've ever really liked, and it's the only one that's ever interested me.
