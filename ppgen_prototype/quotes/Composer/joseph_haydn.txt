Austrian,Composer
I was never a quick writer, but composed with great care and efforts.
I was cut off from the world. There was no one to confuse or torment me, and I was forced to become original.
There was no one near to confuse me, so I was forced to become original.
I listened more than I studied... therefore little by little my knowledge and ability were developed.
