One of the aspects of form that I have been very interested in is stasis - the concept of form which is not so directional in time, not so much climactic form, but rather form which allows time, to stand still.
If listeners aren't carried away to Heaven, I'm failing.
I had a calling to become what I became - I was created to do this.
I think the fact that I created something and had an enormous influence is indisputable.
I have my own definition of minimalism, which is that which is created with a minimum of means.
Let people have an education and you can't stop them.
Give people knowledge and they really eat it up and they appreciate it a lot and the more that knowledge is made available to people, the more they will utilize it and let it be a part of them.
