English,Composer
All old music was modern once, and much more of the music of yesterday already sounds more old-fashioned than works which were written three centuries ago.
Music is neither old nor modern: it is either good or bad music, and the date at which it was written has no significance whatever.
Dates and periods are of interest only to the student of musical history.
All good music, whatever its date, is ageless - as alive and significant today as it was when it was written.
