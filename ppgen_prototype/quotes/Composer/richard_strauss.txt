German,Composer
The human voice is the most beautiful instrument of all, but it is the most difficult to play.
Bear in mind that you are not making music for your own pleasure, but for the pleasure of your audience.
I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer.
Never let the horns and woodwinds out of your sight; if you can hear them at all, they are too loud.
Never look at the trombones. You'll only encourage them.
