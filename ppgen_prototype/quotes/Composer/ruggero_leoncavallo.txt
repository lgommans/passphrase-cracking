Italian,Composer
This new art made a deep impression on me, and I began to study it ardently.
When I need the idea, I can find it immediately. I have a horror of rewriting or deleting; the parts of my composition are carried in my head 'till I can write them down, even to the last note. Then I do not alter a jot.
