Easy was, like, spending time with Jennifer on set. Difficult stuff about character is, it was a little bit like just being the only one with no superhuman powers.
I don't understand the word 'hunk.'
I don't want to lose my accent, I just want it to become smaller.
All I ever wanted to do was act.
I'm always trying to be a good ambassador for my country.
Acting is my job.
If a great part comes up and the guy's meant to have an Eastern European accent, great; but if it's a bad part I won't take it.
