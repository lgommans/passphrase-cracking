Cuban,Actress
My childhood memories are amazing; I had freedom in every way - but I see everything from a different perspective now that I live outside.
I don't want to be in the spotlight, ever! I don't know why I got in this profession!
Moving to L.A. was hard. I had a career in Spain, and you have to forget your ego. I was a nobody again.
My grandparents were from Spain, and I had a Spanish passport.
You can always go back to the place where you were comfortable, the place where you're from.
I think women, we are very interesting. We have a lot to say, and sometimes it's frustrating how all the lead parts are for men.
I don't mind playing someone's girlfriend or wife if I have something to say, if I bring something to the picture, if I can be strong and powerful and say smart things. If not, then it's just boring.
I put a lot of trust in my stylist, Micaela Erlanger.
It's hard to explain to my parents what's going on. You can't compare Hollywood with Cuba. I didn't even know I could dream this.
I know it sounds like I'm playing all these wives and girlfriends, but they're not waiting at home. I wear the pants.
I can't stay in one place for too long.
I always need to keep moving.
