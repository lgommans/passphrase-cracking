American,Dancer
To dance is to be out of yourself. Larger, more beautiful, more powerful. This is power, it is glory on earth and it is yours for the taking.
The universe lies before you on the floor, in the air, in the mysterious bodies of your dancers, in your mind. From this voyage no one returns poor or weary.
The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark.
The truest expression of a people is in its dances and its music. Bodies never lie.
Theater people are always pining and agonizing because they're afraid that they'll be forgotten. And in America they're quite right. They will be.
Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little.
The creative urge is the demon that will not accept anything second rate.
The practice mirror is to be used for the correction of faults, not for a love affair, and the figure you watch should not become your dearest friend.
No trumpets sound when the important decisions of our life are made. Destiny is made known silently.
A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.
Modern dancers give a sinister portent about our times.
