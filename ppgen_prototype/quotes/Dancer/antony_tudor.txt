English,Dancer
Sometimes I feel as if sections of my ballets were done for me - that I didn't do them myself.
My body can't demonstrate. It isn't willing to explore movements the way it used to. I've always had to find the movement in myself then show it in myself. If I've got the sense of movement for the character, I expect the dancer to get it too.
