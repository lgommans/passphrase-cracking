French,Dancer
Nowadays I actually cook Italian-style food more than French heavy sauces. I make a good salad, some great roasted vegetables, grilled fish. I'm crazy about L.A. because at the farmers' market you find all kinds of wild mushrooms.
I am passionate about ballet.
'Swan Lake' is the most difficult thing to portray for a female ballet dancer; it really requires such specific qualities of articulation, agility, strength, and the arm work is something that takes a lot of training.
Most dancers have no awareness of how they look; half of them think they're fat. There is anorexia in the ballet world; there are those things.
Directing is very close to choreography; you deal with space, time, emotions, lighting, making beautiful images.
I did grow up in France, and even though I didn't go to the school or dance with the Paris Opera Ballet, I absorbed similar ideas in my training. I understand the scale of a big company. I danced for one for almost 20 years.
I was born in France. I grew up in Africa.
I'm interested in films, in directing.
