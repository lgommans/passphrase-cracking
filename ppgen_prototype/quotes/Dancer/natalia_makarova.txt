Russian,Dancer
It's a hard life... but if I could, I would do it all again.
To look back all the time is boring. Excitement lies in tomorrow.
Even the ears must dance.
Dancers, many dancers today can do so much technically. You can give them steps that are complicated, then more complicated, pyrotechnical - and they can execute these steps to perfection. But to do simple steps with a pure classical line, that is truly difficult.
I travel like a gypsy, and I didn't know how I could perform and be a mother.
People tell me I'm dancing better than ever. I don't know what happened, but I have new enthusiasm and more endurance.
I don't keep my secrets or my knowledge to myself.
You cannot dance an arabesque in 'Swan Lake' and 'Nutcracker' the same way.
I recently learn a new word: insatiable. That's me.
I think often that God is guiding me.
All of the very important events in my life happen by chance.
It's not possible to be perfect - you can always do something better. I'm never proud of what I've done. Sometimes, I'm not ashamed.
I really feel sorry for new generation. It's hard to find backbone. I never had crisis of identity. But I think many Americans have it.
All ballet, all reading, all music. That was my world, my inner world.
Technical things are getting more mechanical. Take 'Swan Lake,' the Black Swan pas de deux. Now, my goodness, they're turning not just 32 fouettes - but double or triple pirouettes.
Many people thought I would never succeed, because I am so Russian. So Russian, hundred percent.
I am different because I have better schooling, better understanding of the line, gesture, how feet working, positions. They taught me modern things... and I wanted to give what I had: my schooling.
I want to be free... free to develop my art.
Because my profession is the body, it is a relaxation for me to get out of physicality and concentrate on more mental things.
Usually, English personalities are difficult; they don't take criticism easily.
