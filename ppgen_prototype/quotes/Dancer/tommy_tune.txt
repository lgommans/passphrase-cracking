I've had this reoccurring dream for the last ten to fifteen years.
I would just stand there puzzled, then realize this would be a great place to make a show.
Because I like to pick up where I left off and continue from there.
I like a show to unfold and keep presenting itself, surprising you.
Time is running out to permeate the piece.
