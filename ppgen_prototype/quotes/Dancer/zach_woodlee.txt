I have so many photos of me where I'm laughing like a crazy person. I don't know what it is, but I just go with it.
In general, I tend to laugh too much. I always try to tell myself not to, but I think that's just part of getting through the job. It's not rocket science. I want to have a good time!
I can't even tell you the anxiety I get from being around those cameras!
Once I can verify my account, I will have a Twitter.
