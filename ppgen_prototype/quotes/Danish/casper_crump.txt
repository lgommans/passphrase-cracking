I think Vandal Savage is really cool 'cause he has the ability not to die, and he's smart, but he doesn't have any gadgets; he doesn't shoot fire, and he doesn't fly. He's just old school, and I love that. He throws knives, and he fights, and that's it.
I found out that I am a DC fan. I thought I was a Marvel fan because I didn't know. I found out that all of my favorite heroes and villains are DC characters, and I get to play one.
Playing a villain in a comic show, there's a thin line that you have to be careful not to step over.
