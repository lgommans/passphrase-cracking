I'm just sittin here trying not to be unhappy.
Napster hijacked our music without asking. They never sought our permission. Our catalog of music simply became available as free downloads on the Napster system.
What's the message in Metallica? There is no message, but if there was a message, it really should be look within yourself, don't listen to me, don't listen to James, don't listen to anybody, look within yourself for the answers.
If there was no Black Sabbath, I could still possibly be a morning newspaper delivery boy. No fun.
Our music comes from our hearts - and it always has.
One of my few shortcomings is that I can't predict the future.
Everytime we put a record out, we lose people that can't deal with the growth.
Some people try and tell you what the songs are about and it bores me to death.
As long as it says Metallica on the record it's Metallica.
The only band that we have never played with but have always wanted to is the Rolling Stones.
