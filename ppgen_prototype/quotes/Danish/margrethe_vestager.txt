Danish,Politician
Being a politician, I know how motivating it can be when the public is outraged.
I think a lot can be said for consolidation, but I think it should be done for the right reasons.
I think it is one of the fundamentals, not only of the European Union but also of free trade, that competition is fair.
I get all my U.S. politics from 'The Daily Show.'
What I have come to realize over the twenty years when I have worked in different roles as a legislator is that no legislation is as good as the enforcement of it.
I do not have an issue with specific countries or companies; what I'm interested in are schemes which allow for preferential treatment, for selectivity... If this has to change, it's countries that will have to change this.
I'm quite enthusiastic about any kind of gadget and app and feature and things that enable me to have a very convenient lifestyle. We buy our groceries on the Internet; I buy furniture, clothes for myself and my kids.
It's my impression that investment in Europe is done for the right reasons. Europe is a very good place to do business; it's a large market.
