Red is the ultimate cure for sadness.
When in doubt wear red.
Something about glamour interested me. All my schoolbooks had drawings of women on terraces with a cocktail and a cigarette.
Style is primarily a matter of instinct.
Sometimes the eye gets so accustomed that if you don't have a change, you're bored. It's the same with fashion, you know. And that, I suppose, is what style is about.
Each individual piece is a calculated attempt to entice women to add to their wardrobe.
