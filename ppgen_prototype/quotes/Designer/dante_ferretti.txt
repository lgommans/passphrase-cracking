Italian,Designer
I studied fine arts and architecture, but I decided to move into movie design because I grew up in a small town in the Marche region and spent a lot of time after school in the movie theater.
I didn't want to be an actor. I wanted to design historical movies like 'Ben-Hur'. I saw this as my life.
