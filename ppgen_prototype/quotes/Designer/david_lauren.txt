My dad is my best friend, my father, and my boss. When I do something that is exciting and he likes it, it feels three times as good as you can imagine.
My parents are famously not part of the gestalt of the fashion industry.
As a kid, I would look at my dad and ask him why he was wearing jeans with his tux. Today I love to do it. It's just fun to be a little more unique.
I learnt to drive at around eleven years old. In an old jeep on a field in Colorado. There were lots of ditches. I could barely see over the steering wheel.
Hugh Grant does a great job with his style. Somehow understated yet timeless and seems to get it. He does it on and off camera.
Polo really is a European sport. It's not really that popular in America. I'm not an expert on the sport, but it's fun to watch.
