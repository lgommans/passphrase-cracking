American,Designer
I think there are those individuals who are intimidated by really smart, talented people. But for me, surrounding yourself with great talent is the key to success.
If London is the Emerald City, then Los Angeles is what exists at the other end of the yellow brick road.
Truthfully, the hardest part about fashion is not the vision or one great idea, but the execution of each aspect.
What I love about London is the energy and the creativity. Culturally, it is such a happening city, from the cuisine to the fashion.
I think that young British designers have a kind of fearlessness in they way they approach fashion.
I have a boutique in L.A. and travel there frequently. My visits always put me in a good mood. Maybe it's all the sunshine. I could totally live in L.A.
Even though I design my own jewelry, one of the great things about my job is being able to bring in really talented collaborators.
Truthfully, I'm normally very picky about who does my hair.
