Filipino,Designer
I think that glamour is about confidence and really owning the look.
I went looking for dresses and realized there was a niche I could fill in the wedding dress market.
I like classics but I always add a twist because I don't like to think of my clothes as classic.
I always feel like a woman designing for a woman. I know what you want to accentuate and what you want to hide.
Ever since I was a little girl, I always loved fashion. I would watch my mother get dressed and suggest things she should wear.
I always thought I was going to be a dancer and then fashion kind of took over.
It's hard to keep family life and workplace separated.
