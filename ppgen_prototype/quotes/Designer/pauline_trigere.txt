American,Designer
The clothes have to perform for me.
I was really a little housewife with two small children, and I had a husband who really didn't want his wife to work. He didn't like the competition. That's why I'm not married to him anymore.
There was no drive because I wanted to become a great designer... I had two small children and a mother, and we all had to eat. That's the drive I had.
I always tried to design something new and of the moment. The idea was not to make something that would last, but to make something a woman could really wear when she needed it, like a good friend.
I never made crazy clothes.
Fashion is what people tell you to wear. Style is what comes from your own inner thing.
I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond, and I don't touch it up.
