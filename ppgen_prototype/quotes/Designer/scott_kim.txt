American,Designer
My goal as a puzzle designer is to create a meaningful experience for the player, not just 'I solved it.'
What I always want is to have several little 'aha' moments where your brain is very happy.
If you're sitting across the table from someone, the geometry of the situation says 'confrontation.' If you're walking with somebody, you're heading in the same direction, and the spatial dance you're doing is a little more cooperative.
