French,Designer
I continue to be drawn to clarity and simplicity. 'Less is more' remains my mantra.
I love a woman in a tuxedo, or in a dress, who looks comfortable, relaxed, happy. I'd love to dress Daphne Guinness - she has exactly that attitude.
As a child, I was as intrigued by the Evil Queen as I was charmed by Snow White.
While I tend to keep embellishment minimal as my clients often possess some of the finest jewellery, I enjoy creating ornamentation that appears like installations, to compliment the overall look.
Every model is a living sculpture - art in-vivo.
It must be said that it is challenging to balance uncompromising artistic integrity with commercial requirements, but I've also come to learn that couture clients are adventurous and particularly unpredictable in their taste.
I love a woman with a relaxed attitude.
I love to sit, to watch people; even in New York, I don't feel as free as in London.
The pret-a-porter collection will be the same as couture in essence: I love luxury, beautiful products, handmade with care, but at more accessible prices.
