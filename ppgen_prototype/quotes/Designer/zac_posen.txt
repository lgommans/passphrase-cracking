Fashion is killing women's body image of themselves.
Everybody wants to be a star right now, to be heard, to have a voice, so you have to give the confidence for people to have that ability - and give them the wardrobe to become a star.
Food is everything. Food, friends, family: Those are the most important things in life.
Taking sartorial risks and not following other people is what makes you stand out.
I have a garden, and I collect different heirloom seeds from different neighbors.
I'm quite a tuxedo junkie, I collect them all year round.
The biggest thing politically within fashion is that the clothing should be displayed on different body shapes.
I don't believe in one ideal beauty.
Listen, I'm not a rich kid. I'm a cultured kid; I'm very rich in culture.
So many people are following fashion now. It's become fashion-tainment.
I want to be a major force.
There is no reason for me to show my collection in New York, because it's not about craft and technique there.
I am a compulsive and concise shopper.
People who devote themselves to a life of style are admirable.
I am totally unattached to material items.
I have so many fashion mistakes, but that's part of being in fashion. I think the people that you see make the most mistakes are usually the best dressers.
There's not one major greatest influence on my career. It would be film and great artists and great imagineers - Jim Henson, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, people who understand the joy of the imagination.
I love creative people.
I started cooking out of middle school depression.
New York ladies all look immaculate.
