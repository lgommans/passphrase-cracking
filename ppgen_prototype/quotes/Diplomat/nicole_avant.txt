American,Diplomat
I remember my dad supporting everyone on the local and national level. I was pretty much born into it. I saw the importance of politics firsthand. It gave you a chance to be at the table.
I'm out there talking to everyone. My days are filled with breakfast, lunches, dinner and drinks.
