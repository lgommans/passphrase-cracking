I chose to treat the homosexuality like I would treat any other form of sexuality.
Hallucinatory - that's just the way everyday life is, in Colombia. All the time, you say to yourself, did I just see that?
I've been following what's happening in Colombia because it's the country of my childhood.
When you kill somebody in the movies, it matters, whereas in literature it can be allegorical.

I try not to have favorites, but Barfly is one that I like. My favorite is always the one I just finished.
Colombian humor is very black, very sarcastic.
Every time, I try to make something different.
