American,Director
I don't watch trailers, I like to go into every movie fresh.
I always have a backlog of like seven movies that I want to make.
I've always loved movies, since I was a little kid, but I never wanted to be part of that industry. It always seemed horrifying, the way films were made.
Local casting is just something I love doing.
Someone once told me that movies are a universal passport. And it's true, wherever you go.
