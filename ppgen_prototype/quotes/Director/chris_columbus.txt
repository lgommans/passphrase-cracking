American,Director
I can understand the validity of showing people the ugliness of the world, but I also think there is a place for movies to leave people with a sense of hope.
Honestly, as a director, at least for me, if I start doing the same thing over and over again, I'm going to get bored really quickly.
Spider-Man initially made me want to come to New York and work for Marvel; I wanted to be a comic book artist.
My reason for getting into the film business was a Spider-Man comic called 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died' when I was a kid; it changed my life.
