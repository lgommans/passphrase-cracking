I believe that the Laws of Karma do not apply to show business, where good things happen to bad people on a fairly regular basis.
I work from a deep sense of insecurity. I have the belief, and I can't shake it, that there are endless reasons to turn the channel. There are hundreds of channels and entirely other things to do besides TV. And if you make a bad television show there's no reason for the audience to come back the following week.
I'm an old guitar player who has fallen into television and is so happy he did.
For every man that ever walked the Earth, except maybe the sociopaths, when it comes to talking to pretty girls... it's just stark terror.
