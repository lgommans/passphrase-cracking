British,Director
I'm first and foremost interested in the story, the characters.
Film is a dramatised reality and it is the director's job to make it appear real... an audience should not be conscious of technique.
I've just begun to dare to think I perhaps am a bit of an artist.
I think people remember pictures not dialogue. That's why I like pictures.
Don't make jokes about food.
I rather like mysteries. But I do dislike muddles.
