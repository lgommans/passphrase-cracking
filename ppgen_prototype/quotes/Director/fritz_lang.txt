Austrian,Director
I was called the greatest director in Europe, but I was just a hard worker.
Music is the same to me as it was to Goethe - a pleasant noise. I am an eye man, not an ear man.
I am profoundly fascinated by cruelty, fear, horror and death. My films show my preoccupation with violence, the pathology of violence.
I am not an artist. I am a craftsman.
My private life has nothing to do with my films.
I like folk songs, but ten horses couldn't bring me to a concert or an opera.
Women have always been my best friends.
Each picture has some sort of rhythm which only the director can give it. He has to be like the captain of a ship.
In America, sex is preached; in France, it is done.
I do not like producers.
It is just that all my life I have been so involved in my work that I guess one could say in general that, whenever I had to balance my private life and my profession, my profession always won out.
I was something that is always hated in Hollywood - a perfectionist; nobody likes a perfectionist, you know.
For me, cinema is a vice. I love it intimately.
You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale - definitely.
Cinemascope is not for men, but for snakes and funerals.
