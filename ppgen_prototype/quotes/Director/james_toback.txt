American,Director
The idea that there aren't mistakes made constantly in the judicial system is too obvious even to need to mention.
I write fast, I write beautifully, I write convincingly.
I know a star when I see one.
Most of my movies get about a third raves, a third vicious attacks, and a third in-between.
You will never convince anyone to do anything unless you believe it should be done.
Use people whom you're excited by and who share your excitement... The ideal collaboration is one in which the actor and director are saying to each other, 'I can't believe how lucky we are to be making a movie together.'
