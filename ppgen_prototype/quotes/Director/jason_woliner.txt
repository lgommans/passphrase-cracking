I dropped out of college and ended up making this feature film I wrote when I was 19 with some friends. It was terrible.
With 'Human Giant,' we tested almost everything live and made tweaks based on what worked and what didn't.
Before YouTube, I used to show videos at film festivals, and that was good and constructive. Watching things with an audience is a great way to gauge - it's pretty clear what's working in comedy when there's a joke and people laugh or don't laugh.
We would write scripts, like for 'Shutterbugs.' Then when we shot it, everyone just came up with new stuff. We've definitely learned how to do it better as we've gotten along. So basically, that's how it went. We just go in with ideas and try to figure out funny stuff while we're there.
We made 'Shutterbugs' and 'The Illusionators' to play live at UCB.
