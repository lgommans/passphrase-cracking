But in terms of satire and comedy, our biggest and earliest influence was Mad magazine.
My greatest thrill was the day Mad magazine spoofed 'Ghost.'
I love technology, and I love new gadgets. I can no longer figure out how to use any of them, but I love them.
It's Moore's Law, everything will be obsolete in 10 years - I'll be obsolete in 10 years!
The most frustrating thing is that I want to always buy the best thing, the thing that does the most stuff.
My problem is that I like technology, but I always have to ask myself, 'Now wait a minute, will I actually have any use for this?'
All those zany comedies have instilled a sense of pace in me.
People keep asking if I believe in ghosts. If you're talking about poltergeists and weird, supernatural phenomena, not really.
