American,Director
I liked 'The Incredible Hulk' as a kid.
I was a history major, but that was because it took the fewest requirements of any major. In my sophomore year, I started getting back into making movies. My senior year, I took playwriting classes, and I feel like that's where I learned to be a writer.
A movie like 'The Apartment' is beautifully directed, but you can't put your finger on why it's such a good movie. It just is, because of all these things that Billy Wilder is subtly doing. That level of filmmaking is something I aspire to.
Definitely, people laugh a lot on the set. The actor always feels bad about laughing during a take. But I love it. It means you are having a good time and you are enjoying yourself. There is nothing wrong with laughter.
When you are writing and directing and producing, there is a lot of stuff to do. I like to finish one; then while I am editing, I will think of the next one.
