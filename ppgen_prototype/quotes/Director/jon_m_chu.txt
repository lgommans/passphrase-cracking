I love 'Dr Strangelove.'
I love 3-D, and for certain movies it can be really great, and for certain movies it can be poison.
I loved 'The Social Network.' I think it's one of those movies that will stand the test of time.
It's weird because movie-making, and especially movie theaters, have always been so old-school, and it wasn't until 3-D that a lot of them were forced to have digital projectors and even digital distribution.
I don't understand why we're all connected wirelessly via a little machine that goes in our pocket, to everybody in the world, and you have to have reels for a movie.
Once you see dance as a weapon - and everyone has a different weapon - it makes dance really interesting.
Each dancer has a different dialect that they speak.
I like to dance, but I'm not a dancer.
I took tap classes growing up.
I just feel so lucky to tell stories and make up stories and share them with people.
Everyone who shoots dance sequences does it in a different way. Everyone who shoots fight sequences does it in a different way.
