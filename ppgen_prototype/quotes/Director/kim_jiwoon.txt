South Korean,Director
Obviously, I've made several films in Korea, so I'm very well accustomed and acclimated to Korean filmmaking.
I'm someone who has a singular goal in making films: I want to tell a story. There are certain stories that I want to tell.
Hollywood's never really been the ultimate goal for me.
My background is in acting, so I enjoy being able to show what I'm looking for. With acting, it's very immediate when you show someone what you're looking for, and the feedback is instantaneous as well.
Korean films have always been distributed to international audiences as arthouse films.
I want to work with a wide range of genres because it gives each film a different cinematic energy.
A lot of people are very interested that a Korean director has made a western. But when I look at the reactions of the audience, I realise the points at which people laugh are the same for a Korean audience and an international audience.
I want to do science fiction with dark stories.
Whatever it is that I thirst for in my current project tends to turn up in my following project.
I've been thinking of doing a sci-fi thriller or a sci-fi noir, if that's possible.
What can possibly be the common factor in a Kim Jee-woon film? I think what really ties a lot of my projects together is that there is always a character that believes his life is not exactly the way he wishes it to be.
We all desire things that we believe we cannot have, and so my films reflect that again and again. The mystery must be solved, the goal attained.
