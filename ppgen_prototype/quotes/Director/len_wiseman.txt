I'm not saying anything that's unknown, but movies are always cut down and there's a lot of complexity within the film that is not always widely accepted by the general audience, which is just a reality; a movie of a certain size, they don't want people to be too - it's a balance of how deep to keep going with these ideas.
Science fiction is an extension of science.
As society evolves, people are interested in a new take on an old beloved story.
I was into comic books as a kid.
I'm used to comic books being reimagined, different takes on some of our beloved superheroes.
I just gravitate to movies where the mystery is the character himself. Any time you see a trailer of something where somebody is questioning 'Who am I?' I'm hooked.
Some people will always be disappointed.
