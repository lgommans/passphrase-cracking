American,Director
I don't know what my formula is. I only know I like my characters to walk in clouds. I like a little bit of the fairy tale. Let others photograph the ugliness of the world. I don't want to distress people.
I was a problem child, and problem children do the seemingly insane because they are trying to find out how to fit into the scheme of things.
I love when people laugh. I love when they cry, I like a story to say something, and I hope the audience feels happier leaving the theatre than when it came in.
You can really call Irene Dunne 'The First Lady of Hollywood', because she's the first real lady Hollywood has ever seen.
