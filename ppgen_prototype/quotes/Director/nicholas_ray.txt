American,Director
If it were all in the script, why make the film?
The imagination is a pretty precious source of protection.
As a human being, Joan Crawford is a great actress.
An actor can be as talented as another, but if he doesn't stick to what the director's intentions are, it all falls down. I adore working with actors.
I never try to show an actor what to do or what to say. He has to find out for himself. The role of the director is to guide him to that state, and then to implement it.
