French,Director
Married people from my generation are like an endangered species!
I am not a fan of westerns particularly.
I like cinema. I am very fond of it. But from time to time I feel like having some time on my own.
Yes, I am very prolific.
I'm not one to dwell on rehearsal or preparation.
I like films to be complete in their written form.
When I was young, my idea was to become a filmmaker.
I would rather my films be well-known than I be well-known.
I can zero in on subtle things because I'm holding the camera.
You may think it's very presumptuous, but I really hope that my movies are going to turn people into better people.
You can work, shop, do everything from home, and I find this unsettling.
I never storyboard. I hate it. I don't understand why so many directors want to make comic strips of their films.
Working with the same people is so much quicker and frees up your energy for other things.
Working with a bunch of actors is like trying to tune each violin.
What I expect of a movie reviewer is that he should love cinema as much as I do.
My movies are, more or less, very short. I'm terrified of boring an audience.
I like films that are well-written and concise and with not a lot of room for improvisation.
If a film is very clever and well-written, that's what gives you freedom as a director.
But I won't work with the exact same crew film after film because I feel the work would get a little complacent.
No, but it's not because I'm getting older that I'm trying to accelerate. But something very curious is happening: The older I get, the more ideas I'm getting.
I've always done 20 things at once. It's my way of staying alive, not to keep one dish cooking, but several dishes going. And I'm pretty organized.
