I loved drawing, but I just couldn't do it to the level that some of my friends could. That pulled me up unconsciously because I wanted to be like them, and I wanted to draw.
There are great comic books, these great geniuses that manage to tell you a story in one frame, and that became the thing that opened my eyes.
Oh, when I was a kid, I was raised up with all the Disney classics.
I can't walk in a toy store in a foreign country without seeing a kid with a minion backpack.
Seeing how dumb and stupid they often are, I just couldn't imagine minions being girls.
How can you tell a story with one frame that, by its simplicity, manages to tell a story, a gag that evokes an emotion in you? That became my motto throughout all my life. Simplicity.
Every time I work on a scene or I work on the overall movie, I had my kids unconsciously in mind. Is that going to please them? Is it going to be funny for them? And if it is funny for them, is it going to be funny for their friends and their friends' friends?
