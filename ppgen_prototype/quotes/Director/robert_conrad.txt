Oh, that character was light years away from me. I'm not debonair. I'm not suave. I did wear tight pants, though, because I found out that it worked.
But I think Barry Sonnenfeld let his ego go out of control. He told me in a meeting that he had to do something to make it his film.
I'm disappointed. I don't care about Will Smith, I don't want to.
I'm satisfied it's very black, meaning 'in the black'.
It was just so elaborate and so luxurious. We had every gadget imaginable. You know, I had the little gun that came out, and I had the little gun in the heel of the shoe.
There's a gray area there that I'm satisfied is not gray.
Well, Barry, it's your film. So if it rises or falls, you're the man.
Will Smith is young, he's cool and my kids have his CDs.
You know, this whole thing about Ricky Martin, and how successful that young man is. He's 27, I was 29.
You name it, we had it. It won't happen again. You're not going to duplicate this show.
