When we were kids, I know when I saw 'Pinocchio' it had a huge impact. I was ten years old, and I went home, and I was drawing the characters.
It was actually after I saw 'Pinocchio' that I thought I might try and work in that industry in some way.
'The Little Mermaid' was a really great experience.
There's a process in the movie industry in both live action and animation called development hell!
