Color can do anything that black-and-white can.
I use colors to bring fine points of story and character.
I always have coffee without sugar, you know. Just cream.
The Pirate is surrealism and so, in a curious way, is Father of the Bride.
It's the story that counts.
I seem to be drawn to things that actually happen.
Designing Woman was written for the screen.
It's always the story that interests me.
I allow an area for improvisation because the chemical things actors bring to stories make it not work.
Fortunately, John Houseman is a marvelous writer and he sat in on so many story conferences. He worked with Welles, you know, and he's a marvelous man.
But surrealism is present in most of my pictures.
In the Thirties, when I was in New York, I did the first surrealistic ballet in a show of mine.
Dali was the great painter then and surrealism was a way of life.
Cedric Gibbons was the grand cardinal of the art department.
I learn new things all the time.
But I went down to Venezuela and spend a few weeks going through jungles. It's fantastic looking.
I always liked the Van Gogh story because I was terribly involved in that.
We shot that in all the real places where Van Gogh worked.
If anybody reads a story in a magazine or book, different pictures compete in their minds.
I've worked with an awful lot of people. Katy Hepburn, Spencer Tracy.
I made three films with Douglas, two with Charles Boyer.
Nowadays the audience has changed. No one can anticipate the audience.
I started out to be a painter and was born into the theater.
I had given up the theater and everything propelled me into entertainment. And I didn't resist it.
American films are terribly popular all over the world and American movie stars are terribly important. I don't know why.
I see wonderful films by Bertolucci, Visconti, and Fellini.
