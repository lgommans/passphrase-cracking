Wuxia is a fantasy world exists in everyone's mind.
Piracy has destroyed the domestic market.
Under the big political umbrella, a man is just like a leaf in the ocean, with no control of his destiny and does not have any choice.
To survive is to win.
I am a fan of wuxia.
I'm not Ang Lee who knows so much about western market and the taste of western audiences.
But I think we need the international market.
Now a movie with 30 million returns would be something very incredible and the producer can only get 10 to 15 million. This is only 100 thousands US dollars. This is not enough!
This is my first wuxia movie and I must consider this before trying to make something with my own.
HERO is a combination of my personal feeling and the commercialism.
The so-called commercialism includes elements like story, plots, rhythms and large big scenes.
For over ten years I always had, but I don't speak English.
You must know what you are capable of.
I must stick with Chinese language films.
Ang Lee was educated in the West and his English is good.
To do art, one thing should always remember - subjects of people in misery have deep meanings.
People in misery is what most important in art.
I hope before I am getting too old and when my mind is still functioning, I can tell some better stories.
Time has changed and now is the age of spending.
People have become shallower. They view spending, entertaining, seeking leisure and enjoying as the main objectives of their life.
Only people have been through that miserable time will recall the pass from their deep memory.
