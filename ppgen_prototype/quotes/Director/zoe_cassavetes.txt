American,Director
Talking to other people who make low-budget movies, everyone kind of has the same struggle.
I work hard and support myself.
I'm not complaining about my life; every moment of it has been fantastic, and I'm so lucky.
I got to grow up in an incredibly artistic family.
People are going to say what they want to say.
As a writer, I wouldn't know how to not take things out of my life.
I love when I'm writing and I'm cringing because I know I'm doing something right.
