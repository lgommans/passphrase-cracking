There is one word in America that says it all, and that one word is, 'You never know.'
I throw the ball ninety-two miles an hour, but they hit it back just as hard.
You can't worry if it's cold; you can't worry if it's hot; you only worry if you get sick. Because then if you don't get well, you die.
I win or I die.
I tell you what. 85 percent of the sportswriters think I'm stupid or a clown or something. They think I'm crazy.
I don't know why sportswriters always have to write bad things about Joaquin Andujar.
If I was crazy, I'd throw the ball into the stands with the bases loaded. Now, that's crazy. If I was stupid, I'd throw the ball into center field with the bases loaded and a 3-2 count on the hitter. Now, that's stupid.
Why is there no respect for Joaquin Andujar?
