Dominican,Athlete
I will try to give my 100% in the field and do my job.
I try to work on my defense every game, every practice.
I feel comfortable any position I play. It doesn't matter.
My father was an outfielder in the Milwaukee system before he hurt his elbow.
I work very hard at my game.
Play for Canada? Why not? I have a Canadian passport.
I lived in Montreal from the time I was 12 until I was 16.
