Writing a play, you have to retain it all in your head - you need more time. With prose, you can snatch an hour here, an hour there.
I think women often have problems with self-belief, which sounds a bit boring, but they do - and I think when women are bringing up children, it can be chronic, because you have all these other calls on your time.
