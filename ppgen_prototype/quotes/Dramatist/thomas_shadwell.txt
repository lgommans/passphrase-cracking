English,Dramatist
No man is happy but by comparison.
The haste of a fool is the slowest thing in the world.
Words may be false and full of art; Sighs are the natural language of the heart.
I am, out of the ladies' company, like a fish out of the water.
Hope is a very thin diet.
Every man loves what he is good at.
And wit's the noblest frailty of the mind.
