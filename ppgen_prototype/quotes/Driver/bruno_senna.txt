Brazilian,Driver
A race driver needs to be quick, to be intelligent, to have good relationships and be in the right place at the right time. There are a lot of factors that would create a successful race driver.
I feel very privileged Williams has selected me as one of their race drivers. The team has great heritage and I hope I can help write a good chapter in their history.
I am very proud to be Brazilian and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what I can do.
I always want to be racing.
One of my greatest pleasures in motor racing is qualifying. You have loads of freedom from pushing a lap the whole way. I've always been very good in qualifying in the past; everything I've done, I've got pole positions.
