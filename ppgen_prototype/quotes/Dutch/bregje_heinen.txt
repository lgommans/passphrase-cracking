Dutch,Model
I don't really work out that much. I don't go to the gym.
My mom is really skinny, too. I got it from her. I've never done yoga before.
I do like to walk a lot. Mostly in New York. When I'm going somewhere, I'd rather just walk there.
People would tell me sometimes that I should model, but I was like, 'I don't know!'
