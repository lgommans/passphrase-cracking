Dutch,Dancer
Dance every performance as if it were your last.
If I had an extra 20 or 50 years physically, I could have been the dancer of my dreams. But I never became that dancer.
It is important, even if you performed a role the night before, to think, 'This is the first time this is going to happen.'
