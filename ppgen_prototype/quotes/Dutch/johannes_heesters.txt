My secret to a long, healthy life is to always keep working. It keeps me busy and happy and gives me a reason to stay alive.
Sure, I acted in films in the Third Reich, entertainment films, which distracted countless people inside and outside Germany from daily life during war.
To have nothing to do, to sit there waiting for little aches and pains, is fundamentally wrong. Life has to be lived.
Politics is dirty, and I don't like to talk about dirty things... My conscience is clear.
