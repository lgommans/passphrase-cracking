If I can score goals, then why not, I think the fans will love to see that. I have a big career looking ahead and I want to impress.
I want to do what I like and that's play football.
I'm really happy in Liverpool and the club feels such a family. I feel great, I have a nice house and my family have been here from the beginning so they could help me.
Spanish football is very good but every year the same teams win the league.
If somebody says they are going to do something - and then later they don't - it affects me a lot, and I lose confidence in them.
You play for a club like Real Madrid, the people outside start talking.
Everyone knows I am a winner.
