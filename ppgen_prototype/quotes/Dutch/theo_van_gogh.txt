Dutch,Director
No, originally I thought that writing articles would keep me from having to see a psychiatrist, but I became even more depressed as a result.
I would not be able to pen an academic and dry diatribe. I have too much talent for that.
I want to warn against the Fifth Column which is trying to hinder our free way of life in Holland.
If I were still twenty years old, I would really move to America.
I thought that the AIVD was there to protect citizens like me.
My use of language is part and parcel of my message.
The more light hearted I write about that, the better the message gets through.
As soon as you sit down to write about something you are pressing your nose deeper into the sewer of facts.
Ah, I hope to live to 87 and drink from the the goblet of life to the dregs.
One should not evoke violence by acting fearful.
