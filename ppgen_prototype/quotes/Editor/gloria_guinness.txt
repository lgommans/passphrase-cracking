I love to look at women with good bones and good bodies in good clothes.
I've never worn costume jewelry in my life. It's really very self-defeating. Why should a man buy a woman real jewelry when she wears false pieces?
I think everyone envisions me sitting at Alexandre's all day, picking out beautiful clothes from passing couturiers.
