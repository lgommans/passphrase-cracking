Business, more than any other occupation, is a continual dealing with the future; it is a continual calculation, an instinctive exercise in foresight.
I became a journalist to come as close as possible to the heart of the world.
Time should make enemies and Life should make friends.
Publishing is a business, but journalism never was and is not essentially a business. Nor is it a profession.
To see, and to show, is the mission now undertaken by Life.
Show me a man who claims he is objective and I'll show you a man with illusions.
There are men who can write poetry, and there are men who can read balance sheets. The men who can read balance sheets cannot write.
I suggest that what we want to do is not to leave to posterity a great institution, but to leave behind a great tradition of journalism ably practiced in our time.
