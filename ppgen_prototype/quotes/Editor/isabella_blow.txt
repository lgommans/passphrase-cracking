I don't use a hat as a prop. I use it as a part of me.
I want to be kissed by the people I love.
Fashion is a vampiric thing; it's the Hoover on your brain. That's why I wear the hats, to keep everyone away from me. They say, 'Oh, can I kiss you?' I say, 'No, thank you very much.'
Young designers don't grow on trees.
I'm a walking billboard. That's my pleasure.
Desire is the strongest human emotion - desire for a hat, desire for a dress; that's what drives people to buy and want things.
