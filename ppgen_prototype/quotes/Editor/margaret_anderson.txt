Self-preservation is the first responsibility.
It is rarely that you see an American writer who is not hopelessly sane.
In real love you want the other person's good. In romantic love you want the other person.
Intellectuals are too sentimental for me.
I have always fought for ideas - until I learned that it isn't ideas but grief, struggle, and flashes of vision which enlighten.
Life for me has been exactly what I thought it would be, a cake, which I have eaten and had too.
My greatest enemy is reality. I have fought it successfully for thirty years.
I was as repelled by the French as I was attracted by their country.
I defied nothing at all. I ignored the law because I didn't know it existed. It didn't occur to me that anyone would want to curb my inspiration.
