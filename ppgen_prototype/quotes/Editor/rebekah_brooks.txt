British,Editor
The days of foot-in-the-door harassment and snatched photos are gone.
I am incredibly proud of the many journalists I have worked with throughout my career and the great campaigns that we have fought and won.
In a highly competitive newspaper market, every editor needs to appeal to female readers to boost their circulation.
The quality of our journalism will make or break our industry, not the recession.
Sometimes I suspect most of the media commentariat are suffering from Munchausen syndrome.
I was the editor of the 'News of the World;' I was the editor of the 'Sun' and chief executive.
I personally made lots of mistakes during my 10-12 years as a newspaper editor. Some of which I felt were big mistakes I have tried to address.
'The Sun' had a good relationship with Frank Bruno. We did lots of interviews. He was a great character, very friendly to the media.
I'd never compromise my position as a journalist by having a friendly relationship with a politician.
It's impossible for an editor to know every source for every story.
Any affair, by its very nature, is quite dysfunctional.
