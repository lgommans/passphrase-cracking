Journalism is in fact history on the run.
Journalism constructs momentarily arrested equilibriums and gives disorder an implied order. That is already two steps from reality.
Its attitude, which it has preached and practiced, is skepticism. Now, it finds, the public is applying that skepticism to the press.
The news is staged, anticipated, reported, analyzed until all interest is wrung from it and abandoned for some new novelty.
Journalism as theater is what TV news is.
Anderson's muckraking is one of debatable ends constantly used to justify questionable works.
I wouldn't believe him if he said the sun came up in the east.
He loved them and cared for them, and you don't kill kids that you love and care for.
