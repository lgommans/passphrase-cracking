Pray in your family daily, that yours may be in the number of the families who call upon God.
If the Lord should bring a wicked man to heaven, heaven would be hell to him; for he who loves not grace upon earth will never love it in heaven.
Most Glorious and eternal Majesty, Thou art righteous and holy in all thou dost to the sons of men, though thou hast suffered men to condemn Thy servant, Thy servant will not condemn Thee.
He hath desired to bring the souls of other men to heaven; let his soul be brought to heaven.
Blessed be God that Thou hast filled the soul of Thy servant with joy and peace in believing.
Pour not on the comforts you want, but upon the mercies you have. Look rather at God's ending in afflicting, than to the measure and degree of your affliction.
