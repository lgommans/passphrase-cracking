I have a Father's Day every day.
Since the beginning, Native Peoples lived a life of being in harmony with all that surrounds us.
Most importantly, the meaning of spirituality lays the seeds for our destiny and the path we must follow.
To be selected was an honor, and in respect of the family member chosen to run, families held feasts and gave away prized beaver coats, quilled tobacco bags and buffalo hides.
Even the people who come our way look upon us in amazement, that we run only for the healing of Mother Earth.
And Americans realized that native people are still here, that they have a moral standing, a legal standing.
When you have a spiritual foundation, you look at poverty differently then.
The Sun, Moon and Stars are there to guide us.
It is an understanding with the Great Spirit or Creator that we will follow these ways.
In 1967 the last Unity Caravan was held.
It also called upon traditional people in the Four Directions to strengthen the healing ceremonies and asked people to heed the warnings of Mother Earth.
In 1978, the tradition of running from village to village with a message was revived. that first run was from Davis to Los Angeles, a distance of 500 miles.
In 1990 we ran across Europe through 13 countries and covering 7,130 miles.
When we arrived in Japan in 1988, we were not prepared for the overwhelming support shown to us.
Many young Japanese were hearing for the first time the words of Native people from the West.
The Canadian run can be no different, at least in terms of actual running.
Every man should see the birth of his children.
I'm on this road for the rest of my life.
