The privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works... but what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition - to talk about beauty, to talk about power, to talk about ourselves, and to talk and speak to each other.
I grew up going to museums. I was privileged to discover art and artists in a very personal way.
As a child, our house had a backyard lined with roses tended vigilantly by my mother. So the fragrance fills me with nostalgia for my youth.
The day I decided I didn't want to be a 19th-Century European curator, I knew I would never have the experience of people coming and going 'ooh' and 'aah,' the way they do around the Monets. It just doesn't happen.
I can't live with art: I'd spend too much time tweaking it.
I resist the temptation to curate my apartment.
I'm constantly making exhibitions in my head.
I'm a big Whole Foods fan.
