Egyptian,Businessman
Mubarak's regime is dead and finished. People will not go back to this. This is a farce being propagated by the Muslim Brotherhood to say that this revolution was supported by the remnants of the Mubarak regime. They have gone against the whole Egyptian society, and this is why they were removed.
Letters have been found with my name on assassination lists.
I was never someone that was attached to any party. You know, I've always been an independent person. I'd like to remain like that.
I don't run behind authority.
Any government has to be friendly with investors and the business community. They provide jobs, new investments; they keep the country running.
My character and my behavior is not for politics. I say what I think. I'm too liberal.
