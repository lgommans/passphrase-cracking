Egyptian,Actor
When I got to Hollywood, at first I couldn't get a lot of jobs. So I grew a beard and look like a really bad Arab, and I started to get a lot of work because that's what they want.
I love this country because I didn't always have it. Freedom, food, water that is clean, Constitution - these are not things I take for granted.
Usually I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone.
