Don't forget this club nearly went out of extinction last year.
You can take a sidewards step in the Premier League, go to a team in the Championship or come to a team in League One.
In hindsight, that time out of football gives you the hunger to want to get back to basics and play football.
When you're a kid that's all you want to do, go out and play football.
It is always nice to get to finals, but never nice to lose in them.
I know, if I am playing well, I can be as good as anyone, and I want to show people who write you off and forget about you.
I understand football. I have always been a good footballer, and that gets overlooked by most people.
Regardless of whether it is playing for your school team or playing for Manchester United, winning is great.
The decisions I've made have not always been the most popular, but when I look back, I want to know I've played for good football teams.
You've got to make sure every decision you make is right for you as a person. If you think you can go to a better club than the one you're at, then, regardless of what anyone says, you should go.
I might be too emotional to be a manager. You love your players, don't you? And I'm not sure I could leave them out. I know how it feels.
