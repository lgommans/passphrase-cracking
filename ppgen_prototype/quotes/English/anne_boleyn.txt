O Death, rock me asleep, bring me to quiet rest, let pass my weary guiltless ghost out of my careful breast.
Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that, whereof I am accused and condemned to die.
And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.
O Lord have mercy on me, to God I commend my soul.
To Jesus Christ I commend my soul; Lord Jesus, receive my soul.
Remember me when you do pray, that hope doth lead from day to day.
