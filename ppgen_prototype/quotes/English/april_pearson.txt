English,Actress
In terms of acting, I've been acting from a very young age. I've always loved it and wanted to have a career in acting or something to do with it.
I'd quite like to try all sorts of different things, whether it be theatre, TV or film.
I always wanted to go to a drama school.
I'd never done anything as high profile or professional as 'Skins', so 'Skins' is where I've started.
I get recognised in town a bit; I wouldn't say it's hindering my life in any way.
I can't miss an episode of 'The Apprentice'. It is car-crash T.V. Sometimes I find myself hiding behind a cushion.
My guilty pleasure is 'Britain's Next Top Model'.
