English,Theologian
Great occasions do not make heroes or cowards; they simply unveil them to the eyes of men. Silently and imperceptibly, as we wake or sleep, we grow strong or weak; and at last some crisis shows what we have become.
What we can do for another is the test of powers; what we can suffer is the test of love.
