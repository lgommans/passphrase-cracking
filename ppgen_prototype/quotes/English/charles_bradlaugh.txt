English,Activist
Better a thousandfold abuse of free speech than denial of free speech.
The abuse dies in a day, but the denial slays the life of the people, and entombs the hope of the race.
Without free speech no search for truth is possible... no discovery of truth is useful.
I cannot follow you Christians; for you try to crawl through your life upon your knees, while I stride through mine on my feet.
