In America, life is introverted, self-absorbed - and so is their music.
A frisky spirit makes my trombone sing.
We play happy music, and we make people happy. That's why they like us.
Here in England we live at a slower pace, have more time to enjoy things - like good jazz.
Jazz of the sort we play is a happy, extroverted music. You don't have to think about it too much.
