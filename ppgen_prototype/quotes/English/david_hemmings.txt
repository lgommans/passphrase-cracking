English,Actor
I quite like being mobbed. After all, it is extremely nice to be recognised. That's what acting is all about - being recognised.
Producing is a thankless task akin to hotel management. Unfortunately, there are not too many good hotel managers.
People thought I was dead. But I wasn't. I was just directing 'The A-Team.'
I don't mind autograph hunters when I go down the fish and chip shop. As long as I get my chips.
I was, in my day, one of the best directors of episodic TV around.
I live in a market town in a mill house with the river running both sides and Somerfield's car park only a loose nine iron away, and I really, really, really love it.
I would never, ever, ever, ever say I have regretted the 'A-Team,' 'Magnum PI' or 'Murder She Wrote' or any of the others I did - and if you mention a television series, I'm sure I had a hand in it.
