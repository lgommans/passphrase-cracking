English,Actor
The thing is, I am a loving person. I am super sappy when it comes to romance. But I'm not the Antonio Banderas, swashbuckling, Pierce Brosnan, smooth-talking type.
'Slumdog' was my first movie, and I had never been to India before - I was just a teenager in the U.K. with my headphones and my Nike shoes. What did I know about growing up in a slum?
I visit India a lot.
But I'm tone deaf - window-shattering tone deaf. I can't sing for the life of me. I can't sing or dance, so no remake of 'Grease' for me!
I'm not a Casanova in 'The Newsroom,' by the way - just another hard worker.
I don't think I have the pulling power of Jim Carrey.
Training in taekwondo for eight years and then being able to do it in a film was pretty amazing.
Yeah, my family is of Indian heritage.
Television moves fast, and you don't have the indulgences you have when you're shooting movies of so many takes because there are tight deadlines.
I don't have a Facebook or Twitter account.
I have a Blackberry which I use, but I am one of those people who can only type on it with one hand.
The dark side is when you are with family and friends, and you have paparazzi screaming at you - that's been hard to deal with.
