But I had promised my husband never to accept another engagement. It was not a very happy time for me.
I was a sickly child, contracting tuberculosis at the age of five.
They wanted Guy Middleton instead of Kenneth More, and even Kay Kendall wasn't their first choice!
I got a divorce eleven years later on the grounds of cruelty, which is still not easy in England.
It was one of the marvellous feelings of the film, having the music going in your head while doing scenes.
I actually enjoy wearing the corsets required in some period films.
The corsets I wore in The Railway Children are still in my undies drawer, a prized relic of my favourite film.
Over my desk hangs a poster from The Railway Children that my husband had framed for me. It is so lovely to see the children smiling as they run down the railway track.
While making Genevieve, I learned there could be a lot more to a film than just acting in it.
Until Genevieve I had tended towards the more dramatic type of role.
So I regard my part in Genevieve as a real challenge.
Well, I suppose that, in a sense, every screen role is a favourite with me.
After all, a job isn't worth doing unless you enjoy it.
What a thrill it was to play opposite Maurice Evans in this brilliant, dazzling musical, based on the life of two of the greatest personalities in stage history.
I looked at films as a career from necessity but all I have really wanted is my home and children. The two things just do not work out together when one has to leave home at 5.30 am in the morning to go to the studio.
I had promised my husband never to accept another engagement. It was hard. It was not a very happy time for me.
I've had a very strange life. Whenever I've married, I've married for life. But things have gone desperately wrong.
