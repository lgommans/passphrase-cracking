English,Athlete
WE used to tour quite a lot during the summer with Everton in my day.
We went to Denmark twice and Germany and also to the Canary Isles one year. I remember once when we were playing Dresden in Germany.
The previous year it had taken England all their time to beat the full German team in an international and I had taken with me the programme from that match.
