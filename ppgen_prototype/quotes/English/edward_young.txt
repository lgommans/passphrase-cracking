English,Poet
Procrastination is the thief of time.
Too low they build, who build beneath the stars.
Be wise with speed; a fool at forty is a fool indeed.
They only babble who practise not reflection.
Friendship's the wine of life: but friendship new... is neither strong nor pure.
Some for renown, on scraps of learning dote, And think they grow immortal as they quote.
The man that blushes is not quite a brute.
How blessings brighten as they take their flight.
Tomorrow is the day when idlers work, and fools reform.
By all means use some time to be alone.
Revere thyself, and yet thyself despise.
The future... seems to me no unified dream but a mince pie, long in the baking, never quite done.
The maid that loves goes out to sea upon a shattered plank, and puts her trust in miracles for safety.
By night an atheist half believes in a God.
Tomorrow is a satire on today, And shows its weakness.
All men think that all men are mortal but themselves.
The purpose firm is equal to the deed.
Read nature; nature is a friend to truth.
The clouds may drop down titles and estates, and wealth may seek us, but wisdom must be sought.
There is something about poetry beyond prose logic, there is mystery in it, not to be explained but admired.
A soul without reflection, like a pile Without inhabitant, to ruin runs.
Wishing of all employments is the worst.
The man that makes a character, makes foes.
A friend is worth all hazards we can run.
A Christian is the highest style of man.
Men may live fools, but fools they cannot die.
