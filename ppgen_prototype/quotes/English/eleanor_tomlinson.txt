There is a lot of hype about drama school, I think.
I remember when I was younger. Dad's agent came round, and I asked if she would represent me. She didn't represent children at the time, but I wouldn't let her leave the house until she agreed. I've always been quite headstrong.
I love doing stunts. It's so much fun.
Well, Mom and Dad are both actors, and I've spent a lot of time watching my mom on stage and a lot of time on set with my dad, so it was very much a part of my growing up.
Wow, I think you grow all the time when you're working. You start the job and by the end of it, if it's a long one, you kind of say, 'My God, I was so different at the start of this job.' I always feel like I've changed for the better with each one.
I never trust anything that can be captured in 2 takes.
