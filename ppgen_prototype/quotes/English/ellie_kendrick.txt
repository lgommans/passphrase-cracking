I was really attracted to doing 'Game of Thrones' because I thought the character of Meera was absolutely amazing.
I never thought I'd be right to play a Juliet-like character.
There's no point starting something you don't intend to finish.
In an ideal world, I'd like to carry on acting, but I don't want it to interfere with my studies.
It was fantastic returning to 'Being Human'. When I got cast in the role, at first I just thought it was for one episode, and the fans were really great about it, and it was really nice having that reaction.
Everyone loves a slice of period-drama-pie, but I think the success of 'Upstairs Downstairs' is really down to the wonderful format that Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins created.
My parents are big Shakespeare fans.
I'd been going up for things, but I hadn't got anything, and then 'Anne Frank' came out, and there was a sudden flurry. I got a call saying they wanted to see me at the Globe, which was incredible because I'd been coming here since I was 12.
