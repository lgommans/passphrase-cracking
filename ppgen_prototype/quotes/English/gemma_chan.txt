English,Actress
I ended up doing a local AmDram musical when I was nine or so. We had to sing and dance and act. It was probably terrible, but I loved it.
My parents are wonderful, practical, sensible people, and the expectation was that I would study something academic.
Making a pretty picture, an image, is a completely different thing from acting to camera.
As a means to an end, modelling was good, but I had to distance myself from it when I started working as an actress, because even though I wasn't high-profile, I found in my first write-ups that I'd be referred to as 'model Gemma Chan.'
I'm quite a rational person. I'm not very superstitious, but I really do enjoy horror as a genre.
Even though I don't necessarily believe in everything that's supernatural, I like being scared and I like things that are suspenseful.
