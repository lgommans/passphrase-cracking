As you get older, your idiosyncrasies become sort of exaggerated. So you are who you have always been, only more so.
My mother had Alzheimer's, and it's a desperately, desperately cruel thing to witness.
Even if your parents don't have Alzheimer's or aren't in a wheelchair, your parents get old - if you're lucky to have parents who live for a long time. It's a challenge, and it's difficult and lovely and touching and awful and ghastly and real.
Rather nostalgically, I sometimes think I could still play Juliet. Inside, I'm still an incorrigible romantic.
I'm lucky because I have never been pigeonholed and the roles have kept on coming.
I think it is very natural to want to be partnered, but you never know. you read about mature love affairs in the press, and it gives you hope. You think: 'Well, it's not impossible.'
Walking is my hobby, and I'm lucky that I live right on the edge of Hampstead Heath.
I don't colour my hair, and I look like the back end of a bus, so I get asked to play old people.
Young women are still looking for a prince on a white charger to come over the hill or for Mr. Rochester to appear. We all pretend we're right-on feminists, but underneath that, there's still the bedrock of romance.
I do enjoy filming, but I do consider myself still to be a bit of a novice, and I learn a bit every time I do a film job, and I am very admiring of film actors.
All the Shakespeare parts are for young women, mostly.
