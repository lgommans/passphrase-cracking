English,Poet
Be free all worthy spirits, and stretch yourselves, for greatness and for height.
He that shuns trifles must shun the world.
I am ashamed the law is such an ass.
They're only truly great who are truly good.
Advice is seldom welcome; and those who want it the most always like it the least.
Young men think old men are fools; but old men know young men are fools.
Pure innovation is more gross than error.
Promise is most given when the least is said.
And let a scholar all earth's volumes carry, he will be but a walking dictionary: a mere articulate clock.
Extremes, though contrary, have the like effects. Extreme heat kills, and so extreme cold: extreme love breeds satiety, and so extreme hatred; and too violent rigor tempts chastity, as does too much license.
Let no man under value the price of a virtuous woman's counsel.
An Englishman, being flattered, is a lamb; threatened, a lion.
Flatterers look like friends, as wolves like dogs.
Ignorance is the mother of admiration.
We inherit nothing truly, but what our actions make us worthy of.
Who to himself is law, no law doth need, offends no law, and is a king indeed.
For one heat, all know, doth drive out another, One passion doth expel another still.
