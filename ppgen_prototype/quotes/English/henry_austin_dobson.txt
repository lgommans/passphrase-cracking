English,Poet
What ye have been ye still shall be, When we are dust the dust among, O yellow flowers!
Love comes unseen; we only see it go.
Time goes, you say? Ah, no! alas, time stays, we go.
I intended an Ode, And it turned to a Sonnet.
Look thy last on all things lovely, Every hour - let no night Seal thy sense in deathly slumber Till to delight Thou hast paid thy utmost blessing.
Not as ours the books of old - Things that steam can stamp and fold; Not as ours the books of yore - Rows of type, and nothing more.
