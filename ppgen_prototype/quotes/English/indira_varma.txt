English,Actress
I depend on good editors and a good director.
I love theater. I also love radio. I love language.
I don't want to be an absent mother. Otherwise, why have children?
I like how small you can be on TV.
An actor matures with experiences, and the more the emotions he/she has been through, the greater the intensity of performances.
Youth is beautiful.
I've love the challenge of doing something new. Bollywood is magical.
