English,Actress
Home will always be London. There's something unique about the British. It's about cheekiness.
The Americans think British T.V. shows are amazing, and everybody references 'Downton Abbey', and, in my genre, 'Doctor Who', which everyone is crazy for. People are always asking me and are always disappointed that I haven't been in it.
If I had known how much I hate auditioning, I doubt I would have become an actress.
I try to really focus on the actors I'm working with and kind of read and respond to their behavior.
I feel as though, as an actor, you can only make brave choices when you're acting with people that you're so relaxed with that you can make a mistake.
I can't even watch horror movies - I have to turn the music down!
I'm not the best gamer - I think you need to be strategic and level-headed, and you need to remain calm under pressure... and I don't really have those qualities!
As an actor, if you decide that someone is bad... you can't play bad, because even the worst person doesn't think what they're doing is bad.
Everyone thinks England and America are the same, as we have the same language, but I felt like an alien as an English person living in America.
