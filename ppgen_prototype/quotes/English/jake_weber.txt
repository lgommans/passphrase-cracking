Especially on television, it's not so much a patriarchy; it always seems that there's a smart, strong woman calling the shots, and her doofus husband. In the sitcom world, it's almost a cliche that the women have the common sense, going back to 'The Honeymooners.'
My journey is about believing that people will actually stick around. It's a hard thing to believe when you don't have a prototype for it. I've had to develop that for myself.
I never wanted anyone's pity.
