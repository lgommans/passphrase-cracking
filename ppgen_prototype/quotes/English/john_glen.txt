English,Director
It's possible for an editor to break down a dream, if you like, into its components and being able to shoot the wide shots in sunshine, when the weather was at its best and you know, we would get sort of almost a 3D effect sometimes if you chose the right time of day to shoot the thing.
Obviously, you know, I am known as an action director, and being a film editor previously had been a great advantage for me as an action director.
I was never one for multi-cameras; my approach was always... I always considered there was only one place to be to do a shot.
When you shoot a film, it takes six months, and it's very important keep the morale of the crew up top, all the time, and keep them on their toes, and keep them enthusiastic.
In all my 'Bond' films, everything you see there is fantastically real.
When the Bond films started, people didn't travel quite as much as they do now; a lot of people had never been outside of their own country, and certainly sitting in the cinema and seeing these exotic locations - I mean, that movie did great things for India, for tourism. They were very wise to allow us to film there.
My style was always to put the audience in the driving seat, so they feel they're a part of the action.
