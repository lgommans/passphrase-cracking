English,Musician
There's no point in success if you don't let it go to your head. That's what it's for.
Well, it's been an interesting career. Since I last appeared on 'Top Of The Pops,' I've been doing about 150 live shows every year. The live shows have always been well received and they consistently worked, it's just the records that haven't been very good.
The fans have been great, they've stuck with me through a lot of hit-less years and I think they were as determined as I was that it was time to put an end to the lack of hits.
I think the music business is probably not happy with what we've done, because the people buying the record have actually got to pick what they want to buy, rather than being told what they should buy.
I went through a really low period about 13 years ago, when all aspects of my career and everything went completely wrong.
I wanted to be a huge star and I have failed.
Enthusiasm and misplaced belief can take you a long way.
I was pretty ambitious as a child to want to be a star with the talent I had, but I want to finish what I started and bring the fans along with me.
I don't think they like the idea that the people who are buying the record get to choose what goes out, because it's their job. The fans even pre-ordered stock to make sure that I had some sort of presence.
