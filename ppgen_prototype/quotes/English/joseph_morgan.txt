When you're indestructible, then nothing is a threat really. So nothing needs to be taken that seriously.
Vampires are a genre now.
I've always had an incredible interest in the villains, which are a lot more fun to play.
If you're working with someone who you get on with and you're supposed to hate them on the screen, then you get this playful challenge thing where you're trying to one-up each other and that's really interesting. Sometimes it can become like tennis. The harder you hit the ball back, then the harder the hit it back to you.
I love 'The Walking Dead.' I'm a massive fan of that show.
'Interview with a Vampire' made vampires sexy.
I would never assume to tell another actor how to do his job!
