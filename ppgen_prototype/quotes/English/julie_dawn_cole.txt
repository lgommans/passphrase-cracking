You can't be a grown-up woman and not like chocolate.
As a child, I did not like chocolate.
I did go to one of the chocolate factories in the U.K. It was disappointing. Not at all magical! And I thought, 'What a dull place to work.'
Some of what the children did in 'Willy Wonka' is now normal. That's rather worrying.
'Wonka' was an unforgettable experience. When I first saw the set, it was like walking into a theme park, and most of it was edible.
