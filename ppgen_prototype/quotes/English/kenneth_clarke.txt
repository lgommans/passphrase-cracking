English,Politician
I am sorry to upset my colleagues by saying we wasted four years in opposition, but if you do get so badly defeated as a party you do have to face up to some painful facts and you do have to change.
If the prime minister really believes it, he must be the only person left who thinks that the recent bombs in London had no connection at all with his policy in Iraq.
Of course I'd have loved to be Prime Minister. But I'm not nursing a grievance.
Energetic action on debt would make a radical difference to the prospects of many of the poorest countries in the world, at no practical cost to creditor countries.
I cannot remember a time in opposition - I am talking about the last four years - when we have done less work on policy and more on slogans. But because of my European views I wasn't allowed to participate.
However, we do not lack anti-terrorist laws. I do not believe that the recent London bombs were the result of any deficiencies in our legal system.
I am getting frustrated by the fact that we have been out of office for eight years. I desperately want to lead the Conservative Party to make quicker progress back into power.
I don't think at my age... you can start ruling people out in politics.
It would be immoral to walk away from the consequences of our actions, leaving behind anarchy and civil war in Iraq.
My sense is that the majority of Conservatives share my reservations about how we got into Iraq.
The Blair government has lowered the standing of politics and politicians in our country.
The political health of Britain has deteriorated very sharply. The Conservative Party must do something about it. I am the man to do it.
