If someone tells you often enough you're worthless, you start to believe it.
I get bored very easily. I do like excitement.
I really like the bohemian look, and I'm a great fan of mixing vintage and modern.
I love all the premieres and everything that goes with it, but my favourite part is being on set and to go to work and enjoy your job. Not many people can say that in life.
I really hope acting is going to be my career to the end, but you don't know anything, really, do you?

Anything negative that happens to you in life can be turned into a positive as far as acting is concerned. You can draw on your experiences - it's far better than any research.

I believe life is fated - what's going to happen will happen.
I was studying to be a legal secretary when I was called to audition for 'Ken.'
