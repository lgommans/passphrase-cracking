English,Actress
I like playing off strong actors, whether it's Benedict Cumberbatch or Dominic Cooper. Also I'm a hopeless romantic, so I'm fascinated by relationships.
I'd love to have my own TV show, in the way that Julianna Margulies has 'The Good Wife,' or a lovely ensemble show, like 'Six Feet Under.'
I love my job, and I'm a lucky girl. I thoroughly enjoy going to work.
I want to do a big Broadway musical, at some point. I would love to do that. To do something there would be super-cool.
From a very young age, music was very much in my house. I would sit with my mom, with the old LPs, listening to The Beatles and Carly Simon and Lionel Richie. The old LPs used to have the lyrics. From there, I would put on dance and music displays for my family, just to entertain them and make people laugh and smile.
Martin Freeman is a genius, he really is. He gives you every color of the rainbow in every take and it's wonderful just to play off of him and opposite him.
