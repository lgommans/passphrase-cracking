English,Actress
I was fortunate to have had a lively, happy childhood, but somewhere along the way I convinced myself I wasn't wanted anywhere or by anyone if I wasn't thin.
I love shutting my front door and being at home with just my dog and me. That's when I'm happiest.
If I'm slimmer, I feel better about myself, but I don't lose weight for anybody else or for a magazine.
I struggle because I love food and sometimes I can't stop eating.
The joy I get from work is just huge.
I have been very lucky - all the jobs I've done have been with lovely people. In fact, I've been on many where I've just laughed uncontrollably the whole time.
I work much better in sunshine. It's drizzle and grayness that I don't like.
I have come a long way and learnt a lot. I read this quote about a year ago: 'Happiness must not be pursued; it must ensue.' It's made me realise that just being married again or something like that won't make me happy; the happiness ensues from how we live our lives.
For me, when I go to bed at night, I am happy that I haven't hurt someone. And if I think I have, I will rectify it. I now refuse to give someone permission to make me feel bad about myself. They can't make me feel bad about myself if I don't allow it.
