The English are polite by telling lies. The Americans are polite by telling the truth.
My experience of ships is that on them one makes an interesting discovery about the world. One finds one can do without it completely.
English history is all about men liking their fathers, and American history is all about men hating their fathers and trying to burn down everything they ever did.
