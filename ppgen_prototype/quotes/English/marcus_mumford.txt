English,Musician
It's a unique thing to stand in front of a crowd and sing your songs.
I'm very English, and we don't talk about emotions publicly.
A lot of the time writers are just sponges... for what's around them, and so books are helpful for focusing your mind and literally putting it into words.
The authenticity thing has never been an issue for me.
Every band I've come across has read more than I have.
I think it was T.S. Eliot who talked about good poetry being felt before it's understood. I believe that. There are some bands where I love their lyrics but I don't have a clue what they're on about.
I don't even call myself a Christian.
I'd love to write a country album with Adele.
