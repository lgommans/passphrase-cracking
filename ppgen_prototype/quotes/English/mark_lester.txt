English,Actor
I blew about pounds 70,000 on stupid things - a very expensive car which got written off, and nightclubs. I'd always pick up the bill. It's very easy to spend a lot of money in a short space of time, going out.
I don't think I was a monstrous child. I don't think I was ever allowed to be.
Child actors going on to become adult actors never really works, apart from a few. Jodie Foster was the exception.
They do put my films on TV from time to time. I don't go out of my way to watch them. But I'm now made to tape them for my daughter so that when she's old enough she can say, 'Hey, that's Daddy.'
