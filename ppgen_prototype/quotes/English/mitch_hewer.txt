I've tapdanced since I was 11 years old. I always wanted to be a tapdancer, and that's all I ever wanted to be.
I feel 'Britannia High' is aimed at an older audience than 'High School Musical.' 'Britannia High' is more of a serious drama, with the music and dance on top.
I had an amazing experience doing 'Skins.' It was the first acting I'd ever done in my entire life, so I had to learn on set for those two years. I had to keep my head screwed on and learn from the other cast.
I'd love to be able to do a really good English movie.
The day I get too big for myself, my mum will slap me down!
'Britannia High' is this new, edgy series which follows the lives of seven kids, their friendships, and the troubles they go through at stage school.
