English,Athlete
I'm taking it step by step and not thinking at all about a new contract.
The problem is, when you come back in you're sweating, so I wait until the very last minute before putting on my shirt so that it's not covered in sweat.
Liverpool fans were great to me, I still live near the city and they always come up and shake my hand.
It's a shame the Manchester United situation turned sour.
The best player I've ever played with was Paul Gascoigne. He had everything. He was amazing.
Marcel Desailly was pretty hard when I played against him in a Milan derby.
We can't keep playing catch up as we have done for every season I've been here.
We do not want to be giving quality sides such as Southampton, Palace, Norwich and the rest eight or nine points start and expect to get back up with them.
I love tackling, love it. It's better than sex.
When I retire I'm gonna bet on Wolves drawing every game. I'll be a multi-millionaire!
I don't like publicity, being in the limelight.
I like to knuckle down and get on with my job. I'll make mistakes, I'm bound to, but I'll write them down and I'll learn from them.
I just didn't want to walk away from football without knowing what it meant to be a manager, or even wondering what it was like to be sacked.
It's not just what you do on the pitch, it's what you do off the pitch.
Of course, I will keep myself fit, keep my boots clean and you never know.
