I wanted to feel that precision and control and then try to apply it to tele. That's what I've looked for in my gear development through the years, and today, tele is very precise, very high-performance.
For me, being able to go anywhere you want, with an element of precision and control, has been the goal.
One item on my agenda is simply planning trips, setting them as goals, something to look forward to.
Challenging snow is one of my favorite kinds of skiing, and I like being able to switch techniques at liberty.
There are many skiers who have chosen tele for a more compact, streamlined skiing system.
Allow me a bit of philosophy here... We started tele skiing as a rebellion against rules.
We have to be careful about creating more rules.
The best indication is that I still love to ski on most anything, from skating gear to heavy metal.
Feeling a part of that community is my greatest reward.
