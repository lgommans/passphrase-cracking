English,Actor
When you are working on a TV show or series, you just get into the routine. You get used to getting up early. It takes a few days, but once you are up and running, you get used to going home late, and it becomes this very repetitive cycle.
There are some very good people in television, but a lot of fools running it.
Children change you. You have this overwhelming feeling of responsibility, of love - they're everything. They're yours. You know when you're cuddling them, cradling them, and you can smell their hair. I love that.
At school I was easily misled, but that's childhood. I remember I used to shoplift tins of Airfix paint and football badges.
I'm an instinctive actor. I just see the part and play it. I'm more interested in what isn't said - the silences.
My father was a television director, and I always knew I wanted to be in the industry, but I had thought my role was behind the camera as opposed to in front.
Acting is just a job at the end of the day, and it's a very strange one.
My brother Robert wanted to act from a very early age, and there was always a part of me that said we couldn't have two actors in the family because our parents would go mental. So I became a runner for the Robert Stigwood Organisation and, one way or another, worked my way up to movie publicist.
