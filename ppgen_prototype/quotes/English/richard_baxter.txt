English,Clergyman
If they can see you love them, you can say anything to them.
You may know God, but not comprehend Him.
I preached as never sure to preach again, And as a dying man to dying men.
Be careful how you spend your time: Spend your time in nothing which you know must be repented of.
Dangers bring fears, and fears more dangers bring.
Keep up you conjugal love in constant heat and vigor.
Unity in things Necessary, Liberty in things Unnecessary, and Charity in all.
