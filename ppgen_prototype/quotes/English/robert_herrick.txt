What is a kiss? Why this, as some approve: The sure, sweet cement, glue, and lime of love.
Give me a kiss, and to that kiss a score; Then to that twenty, add a hundred more: A thousand to that hundred: so kiss on, To make that thousand up a million. Treble that million, and when that is done, Let's kiss afresh, as when we first begun.
Bid me to love, and I will give a loving heart to thee.
It takes great wit and interest and energy to be happy. The pursuit of happiness is a great activity. One must be open and alive. It is the greatest feat man has to accomplish.
The person lives twice who lives the first life well.

He loves his bonds who, when the first are broke, Submits his neck into a second yoke.
In things a moderation keep; Kings ought to shear, not skin, their sheep.
Each must in virtue strive for to excel; That man lives twice that lives the first life well.
Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt. Nothing's so hard but search will find it out.
Conquer we shall, but, we must first contend! It's not the fight that crowns us, but the end.
