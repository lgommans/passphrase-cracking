English,Novelist
It is a common delusion that you make things better by talking about them.
Each wrong act brings with it its own anesthetic, dulling the conscience and blinding it against further light, and sometimes for years.
It was a book to kill time for those who like it better dead.
You should always believe what you read in the newspapers, for that makes them more interesting.
Love's a disease. But curable.
