I always say Los Angeles is the place where British people come to exceed their worth. It's quite true of everything: The British accent does open doors.

Often, Americans think any northern English accent is Australian.
I'd like to talk in my own accent, but then there's that thing about getting typecast as, 'The British guy.' The role that makes you, that's normally what you're cast as forever more. Like, if I did a huge film with my British accent, that would be that.
When you're on set all day, and you don't look people in the eye, it's really relaxing. Normally when you talk to someone, a lot of the conversation is in the body language and in the eye contact and stuff. And if you don't do that, if you just listen to the words, it's quite relaxing, because there's just one thing to focus on.
With pilot season, you have to jump through so many hoops, there are so many people in the room, you end up doing four or five auditions. You're just quaking by the end of it.
I don't delve too deep into reviews.
