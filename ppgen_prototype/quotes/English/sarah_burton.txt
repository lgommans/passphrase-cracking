I really think that creating clothes and fashion has to be a statement about how we live and where we live and what's happening in the world.
It has been the experience of a lifetime to work with Catherine Middleton to create her wedding dress, and I have enjoyed every moment of it. It was such an incredible honor to be asked, and I am so proud of what we and the Alexander McQueen team have created.
Whenever I pick up a jacket and it's heavy, I think, 'Oh, I don't want to wear that.'
I always drew dresses. I remember loving Richard Avedon's early Versace campaigns. I used to plaster my whole walls with them when I was a kid.
I wasn't the trendiest girl at college.
I was quite shy.
Every day, I love what I do and I think it's a gift and privilege to love your job.
