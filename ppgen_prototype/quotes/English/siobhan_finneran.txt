'Downton' has really pushed me to a new level in my career, but it's not like I have a big career plan. They are about as useful as a birth plan; they should be burned.
Getting older has been a bonus for me. I feel lucky that parts are being written for someone my age and I am around to play them.
I would be daft to say I wouldn't like to try Hollywood. But my main dream is to keep working. Keep loving what I am doing.
People tend to say, 'You're not as fat or as ugly as I expected.' I never know how to reply. It's a bit of a slap, but they don't mean it, I'm sure.
My career seems to have worked out OK, especially since I turned 40. I've always had a character part, mind you - I've never played the princess. But if you're used to doing that, it must be soul-destroying to hit 40 and suddenly find there's nothing for you to do.
