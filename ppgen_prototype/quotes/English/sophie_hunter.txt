English,Director
You spend a lot of time studying, and you want to do something with that. Something that's tangible, like creating a show, writing a screenplay, making a difference.
A lot of people don't think I'm English. I've lived in France, and people do think I'm French, but I don't see myself as having a glamorous look.
Going on to train with Lecoq in Paris meant I discovered European theatre at a formative moment growing up.
Seeing the work of directors like Romeo Castellucci, Ivo van Hove, Thomas Ostermeier, and Simon McBurney and Theatre de Complicite, was, and continues to be, hugely important to me. To my mind, these are artists who are forging new languages of performance and storytelling, and their constant reinvention is very inspiring.
To be perfectly honest, I can't imagine getting married. I've got a lot to do before I have children - they are way off.
When two people meet, and it's the right combination, it does ground you suddenly.
