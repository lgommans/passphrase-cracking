Scriptures and creeds may come to seem incredible, but faith will still go dancing on.
Faith is more basic than language or theology.
Faith is the response to something which is calling us from the timeless part of our reality.
Faith may be encouraged by what has happened in the past, or what is thought to have happened in the past, but the only proof of it is in the future.
I see Christ as the incarnation of the piper who is calling us. He dances that shape and pattern which is at the heart of our reality.
The songs certainly have not made my fortune, but I am still grateful for the royalties when they come in.
