English,Poet
A fool and his money are soon parted.
At Christmas play and make good cheer, for Christmas comes but once a year.
Sweet April showers do spring May flowers.
God sendeth and giveth both mouth and meat.
Who quick be to borrow and slow be to pay, their credit is naught, go they ever so gay.
Seek home for rest, for home is best.
Make hunger thy sauce, as a medicine for health.
