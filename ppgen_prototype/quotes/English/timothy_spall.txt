English,Actor
I know I work quite hard at making people like me.
I know what I like when I see it, but no way have I ever become interested in learning about it.
I was always insecure about the way I looked.
I'm working class, and want people to know I'm not unintelligent and all the other cliches that come with it.
Imagination is a beast that has to be put in a cage.
It doesn't bother me one iota that most of my career has been playing people who are not that - well, let's say that people wouldn't aspire to be like them.
It's an odd world.
