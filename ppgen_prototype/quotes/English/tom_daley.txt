Obviously in 2008 it was 538 (to win an Olympic gold) and most of my scores have been over that this year.
I didn't look at any of the newspapers, I look at the pictures sometimes, but apart from that I don't read them.
I was World Series champion in individual and synchro for the first time which was awesome.
I think the real reason for my improvement is because I had such a long period in the off-season just working as hard as I could on all my new dives; making sure I did lots of repetition to get them consistent.
It means so much to be European champion again with a personal best and I couldn't have asked for anything more.
Training hasn't been consistent for the last week or so which was a bit annoying, but going into the competition I just had to get myself into the right mind frame.
I'm not allowed to celebrate as normal eighteen year olds probably would but I'm going to save it for after the Olympics!
Finishing overall champion at the World Series in both the individual and synchro events has given me great confidence and I'm pleased I've been diving with consistency.
There are some great divers in Europe and I'm really excited about going to Eindhoven.
I think if I am to win an Olympic medal I'll have to score like I did today.
