English,Actress
I just enjoyed telling stories. I enjoyed watching films and reading and becoming someone else. I spent a lot of time on my own when I was younger; I enjoyed my own company and still do, so it was a source of escapism.
I don't think, as an actress, you want to be beautiful. It's actually a disadvantage because that's not where all the interesting parts lie.
I don't want to be one of those young actors who is around for a couple of years and melts off the scene.
Tuppence was what my grandmother nicknamed my mother, so she gave it to me. My sister is called Angel, and my brother was going to be called Bubba or Sonny, until they let me and my sister name him Josh.
I'd love to have a room full of taxidermy. I'd be devastated if my cat, Archimedes, ever died. I was debating the other day with a friend whether I should stuff him, but don't know whether he would end up looking like himself. I'd be really sad if he looked strange.
I liked to be in my own company, so when I came home from school, I'd just go up to my room and hang out by myself. I wouldn't really have friends over or go to see friends much.
As I got older, I auditioned for drama school and shocked myself by getting in.
Since Kate Middleton came around, some people think I'm related to her, but unfortunately, there's no connection.

I was very, very shy in public and school, and quite loud and brash at home.
You want a career. You don't want to do a couple of good films and then your career is over.
I think I would've been a bit terrified to have gone and done a lead straight away. Obviously great if you do, but it's all about longevity.
Period dramas seem to take actors to the next level because they do so well in America.
