English,Poet
Hate and mistrust are the children of blindness.
Yes, threadbare seem his songs, to lettered ken - they were worn threadbare next the hearts of men.
The thirst to know and understand, a large and liberal discontent.

Personally, I do not believe that we shall have greater armaments in the future than we have had in the past. On the contrary, I believe there will be a gradual diminution in this respect.
Empires dissolve and peoples disappear, song passes not away.
