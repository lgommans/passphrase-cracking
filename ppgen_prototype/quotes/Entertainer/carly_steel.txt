The Oscars is always the most special event of Awards Season and is the grand finale - there's just something about the atmosphere that makes it magical.
I like to style myself, as my first job out of university was working at 'Vogue' magazine in NYC, and I grew up attending the collections with my mother, so I have a particular aesthetic, which is classic glamour with a twist.
My favorite red carpet jewelry is by Alberto Parada, who designed my Oscar jewelry, as it's modern yet old school at the same time.
I'm covering the premiere of 'The Hunger Games,' and I'm particularly excited about that one, as I have quite a few friends who play Tributes in the film - including the wonderfully talented Leven Rambin, who plays Glimmer. It's the most anticipated premiere of the year, and I actually had 3 different outlets asking me to cover it for them!
EPIX is a big new cable TV channel that I've just started hosting for. I host EPIX News covering the major movie premieres and junkets. 'The Hunger Games' was my first project with them.
What's great about working with EPIX is that we have unparalleled access to the top movie talent and do exclusive 1:1 sit-down interviews with the actors, sometimes before anyone else does. With 'The Hunger Games,' we had our own studio set up and did 1:1s with Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Lenny Kravitz, etc.
I've always had a more classic approach to style as opposed to uber-trendy. Having said that, I do like to have a bit of an edge, and I tend to be more daring when it comes to accessories - in particular, shoes and bags.
Grace Kelly, Rita Hayworth and Sofia Lauren are my style inspirations. In terms of modern day actresses who I find inspiring, I love Emma Stone, Rooney Mara, Kirsten Dunst and Evan Rachel Wood. They aren't afraid to take risks and make edgy.
