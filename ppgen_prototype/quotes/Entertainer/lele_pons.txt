I am someone that is very hard to handle. I'm very picante, intense... Sometimes I'm very outgoing and spontaneous and super hyper. Latinas, we love to touch each other - like, cuddle. That's why a lot of people are intimidated.
I always wanted to be a singer. I was going to finish school and go to Berkley, and then Vine came out, and I felt like I could finally show people my talent. I can even sing in the Vines. It's honestly changed my life. I don't know where I would be right now without it.
The inspiration for my Vines comes from thinking about funny and relatable experiences from my daily life.
People tell me all the time when they meet me, in comedy, they say 'You have that type like Sofia Vergara; you can be like her.' She's beautiful, but she can be ugly, too; she can make ugly faces. She doesn't care. She's very outgoing.
I went to high school, and I started getting bullied because I was very weird. I mean, freshman year I went to school in a pirate suit - I just didn't care. I'm not like the cool girls - I'm the other girl. The one that's basically a nerd, but proud of that.
I was always the last one on Facebook, Instagram - everything.
Ariana Grande was on a TV show, and then she started her career singing. If I'm offered a TV show, I'm going to pursue that and then see if I can push my singing. And then if I push my singing, awesome. My biggest goal, though? Be an actress in movies. I would love to have a career like Meryl Streep's someday.
To be a successful Viner, you have to find your own style and be consistent. That will help you stand out from the rest.
Dedicate a lot of your time creating Vines and try to post daily.
I spend 6 hours filming a Vine.
