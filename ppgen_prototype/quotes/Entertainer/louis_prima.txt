I wasn't making it with the violin because I was playing all of the 'long hair' stuff.
There's nothing like walking out and watching the people get turned on. Nothing in the world could replace it.
My brother Leon started it all. He played the piano. In school they made me leader of the orchestra because I played the violin, but I followed Leon and the boys in his jazz band around.
