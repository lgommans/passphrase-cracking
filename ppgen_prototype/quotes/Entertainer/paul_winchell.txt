Children are so used to seeing puppets that when they see a real ventriloquist they don't understand it.
I first met Walt Disney 25 or 30 years ago.
I think television defeats ventriloquism.
On television, everyone talks and they don't care about the mechanics.
Ventriloquism today is in a slump.
Walt gave me a VIP tour of the studio. I remember people doing voices.
