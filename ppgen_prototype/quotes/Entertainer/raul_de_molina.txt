While I live with my family in South Florida, I enjoy visiting New York and always appreciate seeing so many Univision fans.
When I began to travel around the country, I would notice in places like Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix and even Texas that Latinos didn't want to speak Spanish. You would ask a question, only to be answered in English.
