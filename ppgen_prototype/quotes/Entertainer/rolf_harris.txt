Australian,Entertainer
If you turn a smiling face on the world, you've got a chance of finishing up a good-looking old person.
I will never shave off my beard and moustache. I did once, for charity, but my wife said, 'Good grief, how awful, you look like an American car with all the chrome removed.'
I remember very vividly what it's like to be a child. The adults you liked were the ones who listened to you when you spoke and gave you time to say what you wanted to say and actually listened, and quite often reacted as a result of what you'd said.
I was always different from all the other kids, and I was doing things that nobody else did or seemed to have any interest in.
I was being singled out as the best in the class at this, that and the other, nearly always to do with art. And then I was a very good swimmer from a very early age, and once again the best in the class, and when I was about five or six, I was the best in the school.
As I walked up the imposing steps of the Royal Academy, I came fact to face with Alwen Hughes. She looked just as stunning as she had done in my first year at art school.
I had always been told by my parents, not implicitly told, but every inference was that Britain was the hub of the universe.
When I draw my caricature self-portrait, I always do a huge smile.
When I was presenting 'Animal Hospital,' the grey started to creep into my beard and moustache. I used my wife's mascara to darken it.
