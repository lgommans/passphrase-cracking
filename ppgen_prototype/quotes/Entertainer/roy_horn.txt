I meditate a lot, but I am constantly in pain. I'm trying to live with this. You just have to accept it.
Imitation is the sincerest form of pain.
Dear God, let this be just a bad nightmare.
I saw a bank of white light, and then I saw all my beloved animals. For a moment I stepped out of my body.
I feel I have so many projects and I haven't completed them yet.
The first voice they hear is mine, the first touch they feel is mine, the first human face they see is mine. They just think I'm a strange tiger who walks on two legs.
He helps me every day to do my exercises. Siegfried told me once, 'The one who is a hero is the one who can hang on just one minute longer.'
The wonderful thing is, imagination is universal all over the world, no matter what the language is.
