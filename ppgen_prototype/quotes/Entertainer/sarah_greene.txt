Actors, by nature, are insecure. I don't see that as necessarily a bad thing. It is good to question yourself, be self-analytical. You get a better performance if you challenge yourself. If you go around thinking you're great, you're never going to challenge or scare yourself.
Being out at work in L.A. is the nicest place to be. You don't get depressed because of the sun shining every day. I love it there.
I move my face so much because I'm very much expressive. I'm told a lot, 'Stop moving your face'. Because on camera, the tiniest movement tells so much, and it looks really hammy.
I'm very much about living in the moment and taking each day as it comes.
Your choices are very important. The only thing you have as actors are your choices: the option to say no to something. You don't want to take on a really bad job and be terrible in something - especially in film, because if you're bad in it, you're bad in it forever.
I have a film out called 'Nobel.' Film is something I would love to explore more, even though I love being on the stage.
I've always been very passionate about acting. I appeared in panto in the Everyman from the age of five.
The theatre training is second to none in Ireland and England. You meet people who haven't had theatre training - it is harder for people who worked in TV to go into theatre than the other way around.
