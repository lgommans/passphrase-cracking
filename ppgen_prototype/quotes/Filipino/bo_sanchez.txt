Filipino,Clergyman
As much as I loved the model of St. Francis, I realized that I couldn't afford to be poor, because unlike St. Francis, I'm not celibate. I was enlightened that God's call to me was not poverty but generosity and simplicity. And I had to go back to the lesson I learned from my parents: that is, simplicity.
At first, the only thing that I learned was to save. Then I learned about mutual fund, then later on direct stock investments. I also went into small businesses and even real estate.
I believe that miracles happen every day. Every person is a miracle. Every moment is a miracle. If only we can open our eyes, we'll see God's love everywhere.

Words have power. Words created this universe... Everything started with the Word. The Bible says, 'In the beginning was the word.' In the same way, your words have creative power.
Faith Words aren't just mere positive affirmations; they open your life up to the supernatural power of God.
My parents were the traditional Filipino parents who didn't talk about money around the dinner table.
The blessing that I got from my parents, even if they didn't really teach me about money, was their simple lifestyle.
