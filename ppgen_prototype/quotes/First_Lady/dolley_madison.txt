American,First Lady
It is done... the precious portrait placed in the hands of the gentlemen for safe keeping.
It is one of my sources of happiness never to desire a knowledge of other people's business.
Disaffection stalks around us.
When I shall again write to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I cannot tell.
And now, dear sister, I must leave this house or the retreating army will make me a prisoner in it by filling up the road I am directed to take.
Our private property must be sacrificed.
At this late hour a wagon has been procured, and I have had it filled with plate and the most valuable portable articles, belonging to the house.
I am accordingly ready; I have pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage; our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure wagons for its transportation.
Two messengers covered with dust come to bid me fly, but I wait for him.
