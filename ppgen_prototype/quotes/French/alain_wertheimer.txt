French,Businessman
We're in the business of selling pleasure. We don't sell handbags or haute couture. We sell dreams.
I spoke to the 'Wine Spectator' because that's PR; that's how you sell wine.
Horses are the brand value of 'Wertheimer Freres.'
I don't give interviews on Chanel because it is not useful for the Chanel business.
We have a bad habit of not being able to do things cheap.
