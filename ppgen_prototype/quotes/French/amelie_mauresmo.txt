French,Athlete
It took me time to adjust and to realise it was not going to happen like it did in the juniors.
Whether it's in the right way or sometimes the wrong way, you learn about life and its lessons.
I think you always have, you know, new players. Every year you see new faces, juniors coming into the seniors. I was one of them at the time long time ago now.
This trophy is so special in the world of tennis and it feels great.
When I finished the juniors I felt, perhaps for about a year and a half, that everything was going to be the same and that I would be able to go out there and win any match. But it wasn't the case. I struggled.
You have to adjust to where you are but the French are all together - the guys and the women. It's good.
Yes, I have had difficult times on court and at certain tournaments but you need to forget about it and go forward because that's the way it works in our world.
When you start off a new tournament, you want to do well.
Well, I guess I needed this tough first round to really put me into that tournament, to really erase what happened at Indian Wells, which is now the case, you know.
Unlike in my young days I'm not able to eat, drink and sleep tennis.
The thing is the game is getting tougher and tougher and we have to ask a lot of our bodies.
Right now I have more confidence in myself. I grew up.
I think I have handled things pretty well last year and this. What I have to do now is try do it even better.
I definitely wanted this win today and I don't want anybody to talk about my nerves anymore.
