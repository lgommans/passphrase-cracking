French,Actress
I spend a lot on shoes, but my favourite shoes I've had for 16 years: a pair of black Michel Perry ankle boots with gold lining.
I'm not a great clothes shopper. I tend to get a lot from Chanel. But I do like to wear menswear. I love Martin Margiela, and I often take clothes from my boyfriend's closet.
My father is an acupuncturist, and the way he practices is very free. For me, he's like an artist. He started to do acupuncture when it wasn't so accepted. His spirit and outlook inspire me.
I love dancing to the radio every morning, to start the day with such passion. Otherwise, life is too sad. My little daughter and I like dancing to classical music: Bach and Schubert.
I'm a huge fan of Italian new realism, work by directors like Fellini and Vittorio De Sica. Their image of women is so beautiful.
