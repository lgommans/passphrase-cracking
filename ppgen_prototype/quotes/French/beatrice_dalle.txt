French,Actress
There was a strange atmosphere on the set because we were filming in this large house, which was used for troubled children. You'd go in and find walls had been burnt down. The building was charged with this history and it stayed with us throughout the filming.
I knew her work very well and I knew that if she offered me a role in her movie, it wouldn't be something stupid. So I agreed to do the film before I read the script.
I don't act in the way other actresses act, in terms of building or creating a character. I don't transform myself into the role, I invest myself in the role.
I didn't so much choose the film as director Claire Denis chose me.
I didn't see my character, Core, as a cannibal but as somebody who is extremely passionate and who doesn't have any conscience. She takes her passion to its complete extreme.
I do not consider myself beautiful.
But I've always attracted attention, it's true, ever since I was very young.
I've never read a screenplay in advance. You trust the artist.
There are no rebels in the cinema business.
