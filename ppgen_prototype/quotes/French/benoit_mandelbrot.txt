My fate has been that what I undertook was fully understood only after the fact.
Nobody will deny that there is at least some roughness everywhere.
Smooth shapes are very rare in the wild but extremely important in the ivory tower and the factory.
The techniques I developed for studying turbulence, like weather, also apply to the stock market.
