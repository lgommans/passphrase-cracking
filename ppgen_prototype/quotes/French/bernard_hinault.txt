French,Athlete
Cycling is open to the whole world.
I believe there are two periods in life, one for the bike, the other for becoming active on one's work.
As long as I breathe, I attack.
I am working as public relations director for the Tour de France and maintaining my farm.
Illegal drug use runs contrary to the image of health depicted by cycling. Distributors of these drugs must be prosecuted more harshly as they are ciminals.
Everyday there's something that reminds me why I love this sport.
He has a head, two arms, two legs, just as I.
I have contacts with the Tour de France which keep me close to cycling.
I have the impression that cycling is no longer a game but rather an employment... a job.
I may, however, begin riding again when I am 60.
I race to win, not to please people.
I slept like a baby the night before, because I knew that I'd win the next day.
When I see pot-bellied cyclists wearing the 'maillot jaune,' it appals me.
