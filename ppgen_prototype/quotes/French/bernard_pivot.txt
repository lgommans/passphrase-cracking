They place great stress on the clarity of our language for expressing nuances and showing subtleties.
I agreed on condition that we found a completely new concept that had nothing to do with the latest books.
This programme would only really make sense and work properly if it was also broadcast on France's international television channel TV5. So I ended up with a double production, on France 2 and TV5.
It is very difficult to generalise. Everyone's adventure is original.
You get the feeling that many of my guests feel that the French language gives them entry into a more cultivated, more intelligent world, more highly civilised too, with rules.
There is a pride in speaking this language.
The more English is heard in the world, the more gratifying it seems to speak French, and above all to know the culture of our country. They find a kind of French social grace in the language and culture.
People who do not speak our language very well do complain of feeling rebuffed by French people, who can sometimes be impatient, or even intolerant.
All the English speakers, or almost all, have difficulties with the gender of words.
French is a language that makes those who speak it both calm and dynamic.
