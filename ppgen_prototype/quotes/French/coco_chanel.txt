A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous.
Fashion fades, only style remains the same.
In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different.
Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.
Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.
Elegance does not consist in putting on a new dress.
Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.
A women who doesn't wear perfume has no future.
Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.
Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury.
The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.
Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity.
Look for the woman in the dress. If there is no woman, there is no dress.
I am not young but I feel young. The day I feel old, I will go to bed and stay there. J'aime la vie! I feel that to live is a wonderful thing.
Elegance is refusal.
Fashion is made to become unfashionable.
Jump out the window if you are the object of passion. Flee it if you feel it. Passion goes, boredom remains.
Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future.
Nature gives you the face you have at twenty; it is up to you to merit the face you have at fifty.
Guilt is perhaps the most painful companion of death.
I never wanted to weigh more heavily on a man than a bird.
How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.
Since everything is in our heads, we had better not lose them.
It is always better to be slightly underdressed.
There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time!
