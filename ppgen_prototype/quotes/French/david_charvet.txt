Speaking from experience, because I have three daughters, I think it's always important to give your daughter the confidence that she needs so that she won't look elsewhere for approval and feeling love and acceptance.
People like reality; I think it's always happened from the Roman times, when people used to go to a coliseum and watch people compete against each other. I think networks and cable channels find it an easier way of producing and putting things together, because people will watch it and it's cheaper.
I think it's a lot easier to put together a reality show than to actually create a scripted show.
For me, sports is a big part of my life. It helped me through high school. It helped me get better grades, because if you don't have good grades, you can't play sports.
I'm just constantly trying to be a good dad.
I had five sisters and one brother, so having a big family is a given for me, but now being a father, and trying to be a good father, I already have my work cut out for me.
