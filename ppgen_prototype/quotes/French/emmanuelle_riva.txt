French,Actress
I love life. I love life to death.
Love is the essence of life; love touches all of our work. Love never leaves us. It clings to us, and we cling to it.
In acting, you draw so much on your private life.
If by chance people would still offer me roles, I'd still like to do them. But if not, that's OK.
I've never wanted to be a star, never.
It is dreadful to see actors reproducing the same image constantly.
Acting makes you live plenty of lives.
