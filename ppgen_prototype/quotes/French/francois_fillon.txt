French,Politician
Great Britain is not part of the euro-zone; but the decision we take will have great importance for Great Britain.
We need to put in place an economic system of governance for the euro-zone.
In order to consolidate the euro we need to harmonise our economic, fiscal and social policies, hence we are going toward greater integration.
The Europeans must now honor their commitments. That is the position that France is defending.
France does not practice revenge.
