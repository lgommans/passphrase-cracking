French,Director
I have always preferred the reflection of the life to life itself.
Hitchcock loves to be misunderstood, because he has based his whole life around misunderstandings.
The film of tomorrow will not be directed by civil servants of the camera, but by artists for whom shooting a film constitutes a wonderful and thrilling adventure.
I prefer to be busy all day long, and when you work for someone else, you're not busy enough.
The film of tomorrow will resemble the person who made it, and the number of spectators will be proportional to the number of friends the director has.
Taste is a result of a thousand distastes.
An actor is never so great as when he reminds you of an animal - falling like a cat, lying like a dog, moving like a fox.
Film lovers are sick people.
When humor can be made to alternate with melancholy, one has a success, but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time, it's just wonderful.
The film of tomorrow will be an act of love.
Is the cinema more important than life?
I have always preferred the reflect of the life to life itself.
The film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an individual and autobiographical novel, like a confession, or a diary.
In love, women are professionals, men are amateurs.
I've always had the impression that real militants are like cleaning women, doing a thankless, daily but necessary job.
Some day I'll make a film that critics will like. When I have money to waste.
During the war, I saw many films that made me fall in love with the cinema.
At first, I wasn't sure whether I'd be a critic or a filmmaker, but I knew it would be something like that.
I had thought of writing, actually, and that later on I'd be a novelist.
I'd skip school regularly to see movies - even in the morning, in the small Parisian theaters that opened early.
What switched me to films was the flood of American pictures into Paris after the Liberation.
