French,Psychologist
There is a point at which methods devour themselves.
He who is reluctant to recognize me opposes me.
I ascribe a basic importance to the phenomenon of language. To speak means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization.
For the black man there is only one destiny. And it is white.
Violence is man re-creating himself.
Fervor is the weapon of choice of the impotent.
However painful it may be for me to accept this conclusion, I am obliged to state it: for the black man there is only one destiny. And it is white.
