Music at times is more like perfume than mathematics.
Contemplation and wisdom are highest achievements and man is not totally at home with them.
The wise man knows how to run his life so that contemplation is Possible.
But however measurable, there is much more life in music than mathematics or logic ever dreamed of.

But a science is exact to the extent that its method measures up to and is adequate to its object.
On a grassroots level we say that man can touch more than he can grasp.
