French,Actor
We only live once, and how would you want to be remembered? I have kids. I have, due to my job, a probably higher responsibility to do good things in my life. But also, since I was a kid, I love doing things out of context, helping friends, being different, being a special kind of man is important for me.
Bora Bora is peaceful and quiet, but fun, so full of cool activities and more; spiritual to the core, and you leave with fully recharged batteries.
All men are body conscious. If they say they're not, they're lying.
Accents are very sexy. American girls who speak French are very attractive to a Frenchman. Anything exotic or different is attractive.
The difference between a 20-something and a 30-something man? Wisdom. At 20 years old, we don't really get how sensitive and beautiful women are. By 30, we're finally starting to learn.
The Argentine tango is very special to me because it's full of sensuality. The chemistry between the man and woman is absolutely stunning.
Sometimes someone feels like nothing goes their way, and then something really good happens. For me, hearing that I made someone happy makes me feel so alive!
I love to dance and perform the Argentine tango - it breathes love!
