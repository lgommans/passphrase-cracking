French,Artist
Excuse my scribbling, it is late, and I have a poor candle.
Nothing makes me so happy as to observe nature and to paint what I see.
It is often said that my heart is too open for my own good.
I cannot now change my style, which I acquired, as you can imagine, by dint of labour.
If a king tries to start a war, a mother should go to him and forbid it.
