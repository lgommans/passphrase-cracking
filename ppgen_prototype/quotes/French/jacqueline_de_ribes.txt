French,Designer
My childhood lacked affection and ambience.
I was very sensitive. I liked everything that touched fantasy and beauty. I dreamed of being a ballerina, but Mother said I was too big, too long.
The theory in great families was 'why work if you don't have to.' Being a public figure was reserved for movie stars.
