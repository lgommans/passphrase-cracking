French,Director
Their films would probably be better if they'd seen a few more films, which runs counter to this idiotic theory that you run the risk of being influenced if you see too much.
Whereas with Sirk, everything is always filmed. No matter what the script, he's always a real director.
When you see the films of certain young directors, you get the impression that film history begins for them around 1980.
Many filmmakers pretend that they never see anything, which has always seemed odd to me.
I guess I like a lot of directors. Or at least I try to.
For me, the film has to be incredibly bad to make me want to pack up and leave.
Cocteau is someone who has made such a profound impression on me that there's no doubt he's influenced every one of my films.
And Twin Peaks, the Film is the craziest film in the history of cinema. I have no idea what happened, I have no idea what I saw, all I know is that I left the theater floating six feet above the ground.
And the fact that I see so many films really seems to amaze certain people.
And I took a long time to appreciate Lynch.
