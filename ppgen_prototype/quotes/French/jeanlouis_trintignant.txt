French,Actor
When you're an actor, actually, you shouldn't come up with too many ideas.
No, I like today's cinema a lot. But I've spent so many decades only making movies. There's so much that I still want to do. Like, live. It's only up to me.
It's never a script that makes me decide to accept a film or not.
