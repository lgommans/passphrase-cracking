One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying.
I am not afraid... I was born to do this.
I would rather die than do something which I know to be a sin, or to be against God's will.
If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.
Children say that people are hung sometimes for speaking the truth.
About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing.

Act, and God will act.

Get up tomorrow early in the morning, and earlier than you did today, and do the best that you can. Always stay near me, for tomorrow I will have much to do and more than I ever had, and tomorrow blood will leave my body above the breast.
It is true that the king has made a truce with the duke of Burgundy for fifteen days and that the duke is to turn over the city of Paris at the end of fifteen days. Yet you should not marvel if I do not enter that city so quickly.
