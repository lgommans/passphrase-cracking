French,Actor
There are actors in this town who made important careers for a long, long period just by taking the parts that Cary Grant turned down.
I never see my movies. When they're on television, I click them away. Hollywood created an image, and I long ago reconciled myself with it. I was the French cliche.
I would rather be called a character actor than a star.
When one has been married over thirty years, of course it would be absurd not to admit there have been some difficulties, at some times. But the important thing is that we have weathered them.
