French,Actress
It is my passion to direct movies.
I don't separate things out between what's personal and what's my work. My passion is personal.
My work is through my emotions, so everything kind of goes together.
The best way to direct kids is to be natural and honest.
I come from a poor family, so really, the culture I know best is the street, TV, school.
My real passion is to make movies, to direct. It's good for my ego to be an actress. It's like someone is saying, 'Yes, you're beautiful! Yes, you're doing fine!' But I feel like a child when I'm an actress.
I don't really like to work with actors that work a lot and are very well established already. In a way, I like to nurture talent and have it burst on the scene.
You can watch Chanel fashion shows and watch the news. Fortunately you don't have to choose. I always vote, I go to rallies, but I also go to fashion shows.
There is an incompatibility between being glamorous, young and a woman and using my brain. The official version is there is no discrimination, and talent dominates, but that is not the case.
I'm not clever enough or aware enough to make a political movie.
For me, there are always things to learn. It's like the next movie is going to be the good one, you know.
Before I discovered moviemaking, I hadn't found anything where I could kind of galvanize or meld all of the things that I wanted to do.
I need to be in front of my obstacle. I like to have a back dialogue; I like to talk with people; I like to share ideas.
