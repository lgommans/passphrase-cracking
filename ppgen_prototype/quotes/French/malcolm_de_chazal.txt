Monkeys are superior to men in this: when a monkey looks into a mirror, he sees a monkey.
The flower in the vase smiles, but no longer laughs.
Laughter is regional: a smile extends over the whole face.
The beautiful remains so in ugly surroundings.
We always keep God waiting while we admit more importunate suitors.
The flower is a jumble of thighs, the sun's harem - the most oriental thing imaginable.
Art is nature speeded up and God slowed down.
The mind gets distracted in all sorts of ways. The heart is its own exclusive concern and diversion.
The man who can make others laugh secures more votes for a measure than the man who forces them to think.
We sometimes laugh from ear to ear, but it would be impossible for a smile to be wider than the distance between our eyes.
Animals awaken, first facially, then bodily. Men's bodies wake before their faces do. The animal sleeps within its body, man sleeps with his body in his mind.
A women knows how to keep quiet when she is in the right, whereas a man, when he is in the right, will keep on talking.
Our expression and our words never coincide, which is why the animals don't understand us.
Women make us poets, children make us philosophers.
The idealist walks on tiptoe, the materialist on his heels.
Women eat while they are talking; men talk while they are eating.
The family is a court of justice which never shuts down for night or day.
