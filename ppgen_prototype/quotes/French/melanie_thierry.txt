French,Actress
I try to be elegant.
It's just easy to be a mother and an actress in the same time: you just have to have a good organization, and everything is just fine.
I'm an Isabel Marant woman: I love her style so much.
For Belle d'Opium, I tried to express a power that was docile and feline at once, a total release, close to enchantment. Something extreme.
