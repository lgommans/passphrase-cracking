Today a new sun rises for me; everything lives, everything is animated, everything seems to speak to me of my passion, everything invites me to cherish it.
The ideal has many names, and beauty is but one of them.
That which is striking and beautiful is not always good, but that which is good is always beautiful.
Words really flattering are not those which we prepare but those which escape us unthinkingly.
