I started to think of Grace of Monaco as a metaphor for women in general.
I don't like the actors to work together beforehand. I trust my intuition, and I like when the actors are the same.
I don't read the critics.
Cannes is a sort of gladiators' arena, and that's the fun part of it. When you accept to come here to open the festival, you know you are going to be criticised. I have no problem with the fact that I expose myself and the movie, and it's normal that I can disagree with the way some people feel.
The difficulty with telling stories about real people is you have to find a way of mixing yourself into the matter.
