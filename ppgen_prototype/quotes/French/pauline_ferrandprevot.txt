People wanted to put me in one category, I think because it was easier for them.
Now, with all my world titles, I am very happy because I can say to all those people that what I chose to do was good for me.
In cycling, you just race. When you get to the finish, you see the result.
In ice dancing, you cannot decide your result. You just have to do your best, and you can't decide if you win or not.
You need to respect the rules; they are the same for everybody.
When you win a world title, you are motivated to work.
The Rio Games, it will be a big goal.
