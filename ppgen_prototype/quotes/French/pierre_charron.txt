French,Philosopher
The easiest way to be cheated is to believe yourself to be more cunning than others.
The true science and study of man is man.
The most excellent and divine counsel, the best and most profitable advertisement of all others, but the least practiced, is to study and learn how to know ourselves. This is the foundation of wisdom and the highway to whatever is good.
Pleasure and pain, though directly opposite are contrived to be constant companions.
God, Nature, the wise, the world, preach man, exhort him both by word and deed to the study of himself.
