The hands of Yves Saint Laurent are something really important - two real characters on their own.
It's my only religion to work hard, and then I'm not under any pressure because I know I've done the work on the character.
One night at a party, a really drunk guy came up to me and said, 'Whoa you look like Yves Saint Laurent' because I was wearing a turtleneck. I'd love to track that guy down and tell him that he gave pretty good casting advice.
After months of preparation working with a stylist who explained to me how a fashion house runs and the process of making a dress, I developed a respect for the patience and skill it takes to design these dresses.
I grew up watching Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.
When preparing a role, I work first on the body language and physical aspects of the performance; the psychological dimension comes naturally once I'm in character.
