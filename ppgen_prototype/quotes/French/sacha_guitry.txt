The secret of a good marriage is forgiving your partner for marrying you in the first place.
Our wisdom comes from our experience, and our experience comes from our foolishness.
The best way to turn a woman's head is to tell her she has a beautiful profile.
A man must marry only a very pretty woman in case he should ever want some other man to take her off his hands.
An ideal wife is one who remains faithful to you but tries to be just as charming as if she weren't.
Why is it better to love than to be loved? It is surer.
You can pretend to be serious; but you can't pretend to be witty.
I would gladly admit women are superior to men if only they would stop trying to be the same as us.
When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her.
The little I know I owe to my ignorance.
