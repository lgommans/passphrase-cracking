French,Model
I've always liked all the sciences, like math, physics and biology.
I love yoga. I can practice it wherever I am, at home, in my hotel room... I like playing tennis, too, but that's more of a hobby because I'm not very good!
I always watch the French news on the Internet while having my breakfast.
I wish I could sing or play an instrument.
I'm from an island, so I've always been near the water. I don't think I could live somewhere far from the sea.
I was shopping with my mother in 2006 and saw that there was a model casting going on. A couple of months later, I was one of the fifteen finalists in an international contest.
Every time I come home, it is the same great pleasure to lie down in my bed. That's when I think, 'home sweet home.'
I try to force myself to travel light; otherwise, I tend to bring a million things that I end up never using!
I'm always stressed when I have to wear a long dress, especially with those high heels. I'm like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to fall! My feet are going to get caught in the dress!'
