I am what I am. Before I was not so proud to make fashion. My family thought fashion wasn't very interesting. So I hid that.
You have to be luxurious nude. It's difficult to move in the nude in front of a mirror. It's much easier to move when you're dressed. But if you can walk around in the nude easily in front of your man, if you can be luxurious in the nude, then you've really got it.
At hotels, you are an actress. Absolutely. You can do what you want. Go where you want. I love my home too. But I love to arrive in a hotel. They have books, chocolate, food. I put things in the little refrigerator.
The key to my collections is sensuality.
My shows are about the complete woman who swallows it all. It's a question of survival.
I think in the darkest moments, we need a break.
It's useless to send models out on the runway to cry.
First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.
People said making clothes inside out was not proper. I disagreed, because clothes that are inside out are as beautiful as a cathedral.
Being one step ahead of a fashion trend is not so important to me. What matters is to always forge ahead.
I love chocolate. Black chocolate with marshmallow inside, caramel inside. If I could only have two foods, I'd take some fantastic chocolate. And some terrible chocolate. I love the Clark Bar.
My breakfast is very important.
