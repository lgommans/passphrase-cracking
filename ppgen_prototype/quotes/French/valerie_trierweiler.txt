French,Journalist
I know politics; I know the media.
In France, a first lady has no status, and therefore she isn't supposed to do anything else.
My perception of life is not to ask Francois Hollande, who isn't the father of my children, to support me financially.
I've shared the fate of many working mothers; I felt guilty like them.
I built my entire life on the idea of independence.
My feeling is that maintaining financial independence is also a healthy way to keep my feet on the ground.
I have never worn dresses by grands couturiers.
I'm not Cinderella.
I am, and remain, passionate about news.
I will count to 10 before tweeting.
Being First Lady is playing supporting act. I am not seeking notoriety and I am not seeking to grab the limelight.
These days, everything is magnified very quickly by the media - the slightest slip can turn into a catastrophe.
I am a committed observer. I like staying in the background and seeing what's going on.
