French,Actress
I'm pretty normal looking.
You're always compared to someone, especially when you're a French actress.
DiCaprio's life is the perfect example of how not to be. I would not wish his life on anybody.
And I would never accept a film because of the money. I have enough money.
Well, it gives me the opportunity to make the movies that I want to do, because L'Oreal pays me very well. Also it means that I can work with great directors. My last commercial was directed by Erick Zonca, who made 'Dream Life of Angels.' And finally, it doesn't take up a lot of my time.
Usually most characters I play are quite realistic.
