Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it.
Fashions fade, style is eternal.
I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes.
Dressing is a way of life.
We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.
I have often said that I wish I had invented blue jeans: the most spectacular, the most practical, the most relaxed and nonchalant. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes.
I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.
Isn't elegance forgetting what one is wearing?
A good model can advance fashion by ten years.
It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion.
I adore America. It's an extraordinary country. A new country.
I couldn't love a woman who inspired me to be totally disinterested. If I fell in love with a woman for an artistic reason, or from the point of view of my work, I think it would rob her of something.
I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.
I'm so secluded. Very alone.
I'd really like to be in closer contact with life. I'm a little too distant, I guess. I like to place myself outside.
