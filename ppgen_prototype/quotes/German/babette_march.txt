I came to New York with $500 and I had to live on that, but thankfully I was taken up by photographers quickly.
I did not have any money, so when I came to New York, I just dressed myself with whatever I could find and the Army-Navy store.
I never thought I wouldn't succeed. Not because I thought I was good-looking - I just thought I would make it.
