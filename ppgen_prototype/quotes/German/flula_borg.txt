German,Musician
Sometimes you have to exercise your insanity, to really make it strong.
The hardest portion of English, I must say it: Idioms.
I wrote a techno song about the four things I love in Germany to make myself happy, which are my grandfather, my two poodle pets, bread, and a strange but delicious Turkish dish called Doener Kebab.
I wrote a techno song after I was deported. I was in America for a little bit, but then I was deported back to Germany. I was very sad.
I really like the Doors. I like Kevin Spacey, Bruce Springsteen, Will Farrell, Reggie Watts, Tina Turner, who is also very hot, Tracy Chapman. Beethoven.
More exposure has give to me more discipline because I am seeing that more people are wanting to observe what I am making/filming/singing; this does motivate me to make videos for every week.
I love to work with performers that are very different to me.
I do not really know what is my interview and performance style.
I am a musician who also does love to explore the world in many ways, so my approaching with my songs, videos, and haikus is: 'Make It Real.'
I am a crazy Maverick fan. I would go there if Dallas was a great entertainment center.
I think many people are finding things I do very funny and strange.
When I see things that are inspiring, I must write a song about it. Some people make a t-shirt or slap something on a wall with paint, but I must make music and freestyle rap.
I like to make my name of songs strange.
Dirk Nowitzki has been my hero for many years.
Dirk is like the German Moses, invincible and inspiring. That is why 'His Name Is Dirk' must be the Official Fan Song for Dirk Nowitzki.
