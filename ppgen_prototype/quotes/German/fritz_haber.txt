Agricultural husbandry essentially maintains the balance of bound nitrogen.
The Swedish Academy of Sciences has seen fit, by awarding the Nobel Prize, to honour the method of producing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.
Gaseous nitrogen combines with gaseous hydrogen in simple quantitative proportions to produce gaseous ammonia.
Under natural conditions, the soil does not lose its fixed nitrogen.
