German,Historian
Every generation is equidistant from God.
You have reckoned that history ought to judge the past and to instruct the contemporary world as to the future. The present attempt does not yield to that high office. It will merely tell how it really was.
He who overcomes himself is divine. Most see their ruin before their eyes; but they go on into it.
