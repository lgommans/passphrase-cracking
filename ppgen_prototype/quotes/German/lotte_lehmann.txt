German,Musician
I had hoped you would protest, but please don't argue.
You have always given me more than I gave to you. You were the wings on which I soared.
The music is the shining path over which the poet travels to bring his song to the world.
But to me the actual sound of the words is all important; I feel always that the words complete the music and must never be swallowed up in it.
