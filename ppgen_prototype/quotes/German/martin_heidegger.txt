German,Philosopher
The possible ranks higher than the actual.
If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life - and only then will I be free to become myself.
The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking.
We name time when we say: every thing has its time. This means: everything which actually is, every being comes and goes at the right time and remains for a time during the time allotted to it. Every thing has its time.
Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.
Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy.
Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.

When modern physics exerts itself to establish the world's formula, what occurs thereby is this: the being of entities has resolved itself into the method of the totally calculable.

Thinking begins only when we have come to know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the stiff-necked adversary of thought.
True time is four-dimensional.
The human body is essentially something other than an animal organism.
Being-alone is a deficient mode of being-with; its possibility is a proof for the latter.
Man is not the lord of beings. Man is the shepherd of Being.
As the ego cogito, subjectivity is the consciousness that represents something, relates this representation back to itself, and so gathers with itself.
Why are there beings at all, instead of Nothing?
The German language speaks Being, while all the others merely speak of Being.
