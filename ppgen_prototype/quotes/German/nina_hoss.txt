German,Actress
As a kid, I remember crying and then noticing myself in the mirror and being fascinated by how that looked.
In Germany, actors tend to be more laid-back and take orders from the director: 'Tell me what you want.' I'm more into collaboration. So are Americans.
My all-time favorites that I always go back to are films by the director John Cassavetes. The movies he made, the work he left behind, have been a big influence for my work.
I'm not such a fan of the concept of social media, though I don't have anything against it. I still love to call the people I want to be friends with.
