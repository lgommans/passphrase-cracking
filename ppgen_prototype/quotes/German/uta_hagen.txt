We must overcome the notion that we must be regular... it robs you of the chance to be extraordinary and leads you to the mediocre.
Once in awhile, there's stuff that makes me say, That's what theatre's about. It has to be a human event on the stage, and that doesn't happen very often.
I won't go to England because they won't let my dog in.
If you want a bourgeois existence, you shouldn't be an actor. You're in the wrong profession.
Awards don't really mean much.
I have disassociated myself from that book.
I love going to the movies; I love watching good movie actors. They must know something I don't.
I love playing Chekhov. That's the hardest; that's why I love it most.
I think, by and large, the level of acting is mediocre. When I go to the theatre, I get so angry. I don't go.
I'm a bad liar; I don't know what to say backstage.
Marlon was so sensitive, you thought the poor guy just had a bad education.
Maybe the one I enjoyed playing most was A Month in the Country.
Usually, someone who's in a show gets me a ticket. I feel cornered. I can't walk out if I don't like it.
We were not allowed to say, Screw, but we could say, Hump the hostess, because hump is in Shakespeare.
They still had the Lord Chamberlain, so we had this idiotic censorship. We were allowed three Jesus Christs instead of 10. Why three were OK, I don't know.
We had a relationship that lasted 44 years. Herbert and I lived together 10 years before we were married. He always gave me a little heart for whatever anniversary.
Working with Brando was fun. It was like a tennis match. We played unbelievably well together.
