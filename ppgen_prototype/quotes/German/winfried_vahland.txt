One cannot compare Skoda with the Volkswagen brand. Volkswagen is the world's biggest brand selling over four million cars a year, so there is really nothing to compare.
I believe there are segments in the Indian market that Skoda will not enter.
In China, people are moving from bigger cars to small hatches, and interestingly, the Indian market is graduating to bigger cars and sedans. I will say that we will not put money only in just one segment.
I believe that we have not yet played out full competitiveness in the notchback segment.
Investment will lead to employment; employment means better income; it means selling more cars.
I promise to myself I will make cars that work and functions worldwide.
To make a very specific car only for India - where you don't know where the segments are tomorrow or will it shift - is tough.
When Octavia was introduced in India in 2001, it had opened up new segments.
