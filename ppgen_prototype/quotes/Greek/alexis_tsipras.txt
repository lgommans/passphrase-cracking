Greek,Politician
Austerity is not part of the European treaties; democracy and the principle of popular sovereignty are.
We will do whatever we could do to keep Greece inside the euro and inside Europe.
A Syriza government will respect Greece's obligation as a eurozone member to maintain a balanced budget and will commit to quantitative targets.
I don't believe there are heroes or saviours in politics.
What, ultimately, is Greece if it is not the people who live in this country? It's not the mountains and the plains.
Greece gave democracy to the rest of the world.
There was a huge lack of freedom in communist regimes, but at least they had humanity at the center of their thinking.
Syriza is what it is: a radical, left-wing party that feels the pulse of the times, knows what's at stake, and is after a wide consensus and unity for political change in Greece. This is something that departs from the narrow limits of the radical left.
The U.S. have printed money; they intend to tax the rich in order to avoid the fiscal cliff. These are things that sees anyone who dares to propose them in Greece and Europe labeled an extremist, when at the same time, it's what Obama does.
