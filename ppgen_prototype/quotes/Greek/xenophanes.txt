Greek,Philosopher
If cattle and horses, or lions, had hands, or were able to draw with their feet and produce the works which men do, horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make the gods' bodies the same shape as their own.
Men create the gods in their own image.
But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the work that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves.
The gods did not reveal, from the beginning, all things to us.
No human being will ever know the Truth, for even if they happen to say it by chance, they would not even known they had done so.
It isn't right to judge strength as better than good wisdom.
It takes a wise man to recognize a wise man.
Better than the strength of men and horses is our wisdom.
There is one God - supreme among gods and men - who is like mortals in neither body nor mind.
God is one, greatest of gods and men, not like mortals in body or thought.
All men begin their learning with Homer.
