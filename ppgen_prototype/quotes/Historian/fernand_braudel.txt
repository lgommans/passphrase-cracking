French,Historian
Everything must be recaptured and relocated in the general framework of history, so that despite the difficulties, the fundamental paradoxes and contradictions, we may respect the unity of history which is also the unity of life.
History may be divided into three movements: what moves rapidly, what moves slowly and what appears not to move at all.
