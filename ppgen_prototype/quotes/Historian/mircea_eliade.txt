Romanian,Historian
Whether religion is man-made is a question for philosophers or theologians. But the forms are man-made. They are a human response to something. As a historian of religions, I am interested in those expressions.
Every religion implies that it treats the problem of being and nonbeing, life and death. Their languages are different, but they speak about the same things.
