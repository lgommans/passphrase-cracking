Justice will not come to Athens until those who are not injured are as indignant as those who are injured.
Wars spring from unseen and generally insignificant causes, the first outbreak being often but an explosion of anger.
The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.

We should remember that one man is much the same as another, and that he is best who is trained in the severest school.
We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.
Men naturally despise those who court them, but respect those who do not give way to them.
Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior.
