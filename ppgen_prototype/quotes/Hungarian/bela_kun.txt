Hungarian,Politician
I also had a mistaken attitude towards certain comrades.
As to Magyar, I think that my speech was incorrect, inappropriate.
It is correct that I overlooked the contamination of the party, not just now but also in the past.
My personal influence in the Revolutionary Governing Council is such that the dictatorship of the proletariat is firmly established, since the masses are backing me.
I do not think that I am a person who cannot be trusted.
