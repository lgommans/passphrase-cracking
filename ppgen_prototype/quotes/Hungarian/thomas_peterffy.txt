Never bend the rules. You bend the rules a little bit and then it's a slippery slope.
I paid $1.9 billion in taxes in my lifetime.
I had an extremely boring time doing 20 to 30 trades a day while everyone was talking about baseball or basketball. So I stood there fantasizing about a device that could do the same thing I was doing.
Some traders still think that a computer could not trade as well as they can.
America's wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success. Take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy.
Yes, in socialism the rich will be poorer - but the poor will also be poorer. People will lose interest in really working hard and creating jobs.
I grew up in a socialist country. And I have seen what that does to people. There is no hope, no freedom. No pride in achievement.
It seems like people don't learn from the past.
I see no point in exchanging something that I understand, know, love and think will have a great future for something else that I know much less about.
You win a few, you lose a few.
The rich support the poor primarily via taxes.
My charitable donations go to educational efforts, such as Teach for America, Vanderbilt University, Berkshire School.
