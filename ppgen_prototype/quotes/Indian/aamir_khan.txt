Indian,Actor
The journey that I have undertaken, meeting people from all walks of life and learning from them, has been my biggest achievement.
I am happy that I have entertained people and made them happy.
When I was new, I didn't know where my career will go. Initially, my films were not even successful, but then I learned a lot from my mistakes.
I do what I feel is right. I am not scared to walk on the new path and take risk.
I have had unsuccessful films, but I learned a lot from those films. I give my failures as much importance as my success.
