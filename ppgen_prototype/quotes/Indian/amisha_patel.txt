Indian,Actress
Being sexy is all about attitude, not body type. It's a state of mind.
Life is all about evolution. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone in my life. Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if people misunderstood or judged me, I have learned from these incidents. We are human and we make mistakes, but learning from them is what makes the difference.
Cleaning is therapy for me. I'm not ashamed of holding the duster or broom.
I love human beings. I believe that there is so much to learn from every person you meet, including a child.
Had I not made it big, my family would have told me to recheck my decision. Now that I am successful, there is no way. They have to accept it gracefully.
I reprimand people, even those working with me, for littering the roads.
Believe me, it's not easy being an actress and a producer, especially with no big daddy to support you.
I feel French is very close to Urdu. Both languages are beautiful. Sadly, their beauty is lost in translation.
I would never deny the importance of the media, but I wouldn't go out of the way to splash my pictures all over town. I'd rather let my work do the talking.
To join or not to join films was the biggest choice I had to make. I'd done two years of biogenetic engineering, was an economics graduate and a gold medalist. I had also been a Bharatanatyam dancer from age five, always won the best actress award in school. Finally, I decided to do things for my soul, chose to act.
I work on my body to stay fit, but that does not make me superior to anyone. I am a forthright and hardworking girl.
