Indian,Businesswoman
I chose to be a working wife and mother. Why should I compromise on either?
I always believe that, as you start out, while you should have a big dream - a big goal - but it's also important to move step by step. So, you know, frankly, if you ask me, when I started as a management trainee in 1984, I don't know that I really thought that I would become the CEO.
Thankfully I have an ecosystem of in-laws, parents and husband, who are my rocks.
What my parents believed was that, you know, the best wealth they could give to us children was to educate us and, you know - give us that foundation.
India's growth drivers are actually two growth drivers. One is consumption, which arises out of our demographic advantage. And the other is the investments. Because we need a lot of investment in the country.
Clearly, for an organization to move on, it is the job of the leader to be that sponge that takes the stress from inside and the outside.
There were so many occasions when I wasn't around for my kids or my husband. But we learnt to work around it.
