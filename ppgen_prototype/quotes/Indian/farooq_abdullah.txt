Indian,Politician
I should learn the language of a politician - give away as little and keep the rest to yourself. Not lie, I just want to be more guarded.
I can't hide things from my Maker, so it is better to be honest.
I trust people too much, and the other tragedy is I can't say no.
I want to become foreign minister of India one day and then President of India.
