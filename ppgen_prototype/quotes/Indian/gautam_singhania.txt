The breaks you take from work pay you back manifold when you return because you come back with a fresher mind and newer thinking. Some of your best ideas come when you're on vacation.
When people go to Ladakh, they go to Leh; they don't go to everything in the middle.
Most people who go to Rajasthan go to Udaipur, Jodhpur or Jaipur.
The fun of sitting around Pangong Lake with 40 guys around a fireplace, having a glass of wine... staying in one camp together... that's an experience. Waking up at 5 in the morning, watching the sun come up. You don't do these things in Bombay.
To customers, it's the shirt that matters, not where it's made.
I'd love to get into the hospitality industry, but I just don't have the time.
I feel very strongly that you shouldn't mix your emotions with business. When it comes to my emotions, I certainly don't mix them with my business.
I think management and technology all come into play in building a super-yacht. It is a challenge - a serious challenge.
Boats are something I am very, very passionate about; cars are something I grew up with... I used to race cars since I was a child.
It's impossible to be someone you're not, so quit trying. I am as passionate about my hobbies as I am about my work and my family. All three are equally important to me at all times.
Work and play go hand in hand. A lot of people want to work, work, and work until 40, and then relax. Who says you'll get to 40? Or 50? Who knows what'll happen in the next five minutes? The only reality is the present. And if you can't learn to live in the moment, you'll never be content.
I don't think even one per cent of the people in this world explore more than 10 per cent of all that this world has to offer. That's a shame!
