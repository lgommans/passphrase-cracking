Social service has always been my priority, and I want to help the poor.
There shouldn't be two Indias; we need affordable housing. There are projections that by 2017, 18.78 million will be the number of those living in slums.
There have been reports of many child marriages taking place in the Malabar region in Kerala, especially among the Muslim community. However, under Muslim Personal Law, a girl can be married once she attains puberty, and hence we cannot say that such marriages are not valid.
We need to evolve a uniform law which does not leave room for any confusion and states that the minimum marriageable age for women is 18 years and that for men is 21 years. But the demand for this should come from within the community.
