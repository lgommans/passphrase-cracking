Indian,Actor
The world helps you to keep evolving and hope it's for better. You have to rise above all the tragedies in life. You have to grow, and if you stop growing, you are old.
Life hits you hard. But it takes you three seconds to decide if you are a superhero or not. I am.
I have been elevated to such a high status that the fall will be very steep.
I make the best Spanish omelettes in the world, but I won't tell you the recipe!
I can be the best James Bond there is.
It's not a prerequisite for an actor to be obsessed about his looks. I know there are people who don't look in the mirror at all, and I'm getting there.
I can't act, and so I have to live that particular character in my real life and then exhibit it on screen.
I don't consider myself a good actor.
If a film is good, it will work no matter what.
I take my time to get into the mindset of the character and say my lines. I really have to be the person that I am playing.
