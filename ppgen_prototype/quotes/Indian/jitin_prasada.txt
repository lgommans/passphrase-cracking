Indian,Politician
Even to build a vote bank, you need to tackle the problems people face. Rural jobs that stop migration to cities, road networks for better connectivity, and a sense of security get people to vote for you.
Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi are our star campaigners. Our party will fight under their leadership.
Narendra Modi is a bubble. After elevation in his party, his first test was the Karnataka election. He failed miserably in that.
I work in a hostile atmosphere, and my voters are the only strength I have.
In Shahjahanpur, there was not much of a political fight. It was my family constituency and I knew all the voters and their problems and needs.
In India, because of the huge investments materialising in industry and infrastructure projects, the demand for steel has grown much faster than anticipated.
I strongly believe that for the steel prices to be market-driven, without distortions, we need to substantially increase the production capacity.
