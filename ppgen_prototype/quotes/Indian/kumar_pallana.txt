Indian,Actor
I want more job. I want to die entertaining.
My father lost his business. Our house was locked up, and we had to leave.
To make the people happy, to forget their problems. Then, to me, I'm doing my job. But to act is a God gift.
Each of us has our own destiny. Mine is to be an actor.
I'm an old guy. I don't hustle and I don't bustle. So sometimes you're behind, but that's okay. Your peace of mind is more important. I have seen the people who hustle and bustle, and they are already gone, at a young age. They could have enjoyed life.
