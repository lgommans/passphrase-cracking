In a sportsperson's life, pressure is always there; you have to learn to deal with it.
Without boxing, I can't live. I love boxing.
I had no support, no opportunity, no sponsors backing me for most of my career.
I took up boxing out of sheer interest and to help my parents financially.
I look like I'm Chinese or Thai or Japanese - very different.
I started athletics in 1999, throwing discus and shot put. I didn't tell my family when I started boxing.
I miss my kids, and they miss me. It's very difficult, but I have to do it for my country and fulfill my dreams coming to the 2012 London Olympics.
My normal weight category is 48 kg. So for the 51 kg. category, I had to depend on lots of food and drinks before going in for the weigh-in. But that does not make my strength, my muscles. It's a little bit different. If there's a 48 kg. category, it's a perfect fit for me.
Like every other athlete, I always dreamt of playing at the Olympics, and it feels really good to see that dream materialize.
The incentive of a medal at the biggest sporting arena in the world is what drives me. Before I hang my gloves, I want to win the Olympic medal, and my performance at London will decide my future in the sport.
