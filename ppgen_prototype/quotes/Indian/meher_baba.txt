One has to go beyond the mind to experience the spiritual bliss of desirelessness.
The satisfaction derived from the fleeting things of life is not lasting; and our wants remain unfulfilled. There is thus a general sense of dissatisfaction accompanied by all kinds of worries.
Divine desperateness is the beginning of spiritual awakening because it gives rise to the aspiration for God-realisation.
What I want from my Lovers is real unadulterated love, and from my genuine workers I expect real work done.
In the world, there are countless Sadhus, Mahatmas, Mahapurushas, Saints, Yogis, and Walis, though the number of genuine ones is very, very limited. I am neither a Mahatma nor a Mahapurush, neither a Sadhu nor a Saint, neither a Yogi nor a Wali. I am the ancient One. The Highest of the High!
