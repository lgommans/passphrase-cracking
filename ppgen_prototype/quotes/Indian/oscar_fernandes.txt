Indian,Politician
Terrorism should be seen in the light of the country's security and not from the narrow perspective of caste, creed and religion.
Politicisation of terrorism for narrow gains is not good for society in general and the country in particular.
Things said by political parties are different from the decisions of the government which are taken to uphold the rule of law. The government takes decisions that are best for the country.
