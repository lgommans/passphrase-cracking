Indian,Actress
I think I've become the brand ambassador of arranged marriages, especially for working Indian women.
I'm not desperately looking for a man, but I'm sure one of these days, I'll find my Mr. Right.
I have been fortunate to experience a wide range of characters. What more can an actor ask for?
When a product is made, everyone hopes for the best. Whether it could have been better or not is more of an afterthought.
I haven't thought about getting into production. I'm interested in the creative aspect of storytelling.
I've always wanted to take up work that my heart is convinced about. And I shall continue to do so.
I feel birth, death, marriage is destined, and these things can't be manipulated. I have surrendered my life completely. So, whenever it happens, I will accept it.
There is no guarantee what will give you happiness any which way. I know many married people who are unhappy.
