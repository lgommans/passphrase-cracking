Indian,Businessman
Having spent almost two decades setting up and running Fortis, our mission of saving and enriching lives is an integral part of my being. Over time, this has inspired me to do more direct service and give back to society a little of what I have received in abundance.
I will move to Dera, Beas, post-transitioning my executive responsibilities at Fortis.
Our businesses are stable, and Fortis is on a promising trajectory. I want to assure our business partners and colleagues that I will continue to guide the organization to realize its full potential.
