Science is a perception of the world around us. Science is a place where what you find in nature pleases you.
The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.
Indeed, I would feel that an appreciation of the arts in a conscious, disciplined way might help one to do science better.
I am aware of the usefulness of science to society and of the benefits society derives from it.
