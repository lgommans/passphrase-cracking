I was traumatised in the medieval Afghan society at Sarana village by the local boys of Omar's Taliban who forced my in-laws to subjugate me for trying to be different. There can be Omars in other religions, too, who oppress women.
The Afghans, despite their backwardness, are a friendly lot, but the Taliban are as barbaric as the Huns from the past.
