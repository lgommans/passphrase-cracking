Indian,Businessman
I stand by the principle of honesty, fair play, and trustworthiness.
Be as transparent as you can in your trade. The big thing in life is trust.
I don't calculate my net worth.
We don't find it tough to sell gold; people love to buy jewelry. The only way to make your wife, sister or lover happy is to give them something that they love.
A private jet is not a luxury; it is a necessity.
