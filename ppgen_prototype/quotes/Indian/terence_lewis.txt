Indian,Dancer
I love to go to the gym for a couple of hours daily. Besides, I love my dancing routines; dance helps me unwind, de-stress, and introspect.
I love to sing and play the piano. As a child, I've always loved to sing my heart out, and even my teachers encouraged me to take up singing.
I love watching foreign films on my projector at home along with my closely knit group of friends and family. I also love to dissect movies and discuss them with my friends who are movie buffs.
Food does not rank high on my list. I eat to live, and I'm very particular about my diet. It's strictly low fat diet for me.
When I started off with 'Dance India Dance,' even the TV show people thought it won't be accepted. But with the talent that the show received, I was able to personally tutor dancers to amalgamate contemporary dance moves on Bollywood tracks.
When I think of Bollywood dance, I think of choreographies from the '70s and '80s. That was true Bollywood, what is now known as old school Bollywood.
After working for TV, you realise that the majority of the population still wonders where their next meal is coming from.
I think people watch TV to escape from life.
As a kid, I used to sing, dance, I was into dramatics. I would love to pursue being an actor, but not as such as a hero.
I want to become actor not because I want money and become more famous. No I don't want that. It is not that l want stardom, I want to contribute to good cinema.
By being an actor, one can explore various personalities of a human being, be that person, behave and live that person's life, and then you are back to your normal life.
I want to be part of movies that have important and interesting subjects but are not depressing and are rather satirical and funny.
