Indian,Actress
I was the youngest of nine siblings... I lost my father when I was just 13. For me, the elders have been my gods.
The most delightful aspect about the language of cinema is that it speaks to each of us in different ways - it is a purely subjective experience.
I believe change is the only constant in life, and there is a place and time for everything.
I don't believe in themes.
I may be boring, but that's okay; I don't want to hard-sell myself.
There was a time when I could only relate to happy works. With time, my taste has evolved.
I was never meant to sit at home.
In the role of Miss Munim, I had credibility as an individual.
