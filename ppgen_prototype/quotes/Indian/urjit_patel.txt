Indian,Economist
The lack of a consistent policy from major economies is the main source of volatility.
From the RBI side, the fake Indian currency note is an important issue that needed to be addressed. The other collateral benefits from this, in terms of greater accountability, better public finance, more transparency, are, by definition, areas that take time to fully play out.
I think India's policy that the openness of trade should be carried through a multilateral process is the right one.
