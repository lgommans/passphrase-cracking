Indian,Director
Mumbai's infectious. Once you start living in Mumbai, working in Mumbai, I don't think you can live anywhere else.
When I was in college, my brother, B.R. Chopra, who is everything to me, was a director in Bombay. He taught me filmmaking. What I am today is because of him.
I don't make romantic films. I make films about human relationships.
When I was in college, I had only one ambition that one day I would like to be a director.
I've been able to make some wonderful films, but sometimes you make films with great passion - great belief - and these films slightly don't work at the box office, and they become your favorite films.
The secret of being a great actor is a love of food.
Human beings are very complex creatures. This desire, this greed, this love is very complex.
I'm not making films just to be bold.
