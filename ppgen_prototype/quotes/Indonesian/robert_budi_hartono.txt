Indonesian,Businessman
Don't ever break someone's trust. Once you do, then nobody wants to do business with you.
I always assign auditors to strictly supervise the businesses.
I've never liked playing golf. I prefer to be on the treadmill to keep in shape.
I don't avoid any particular food. But I don't eat too much.
