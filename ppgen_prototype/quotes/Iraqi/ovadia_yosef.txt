There was a tsunami and there are terrible natural disasters, all of this because of too little Torah study.
We should have a banquet on the day haters die.
You must not lean on a tree on Sabbath, if the tree might be dependent on you for support.
Saving a life overrides territories.
Where there is Torah it sustains the world.
