I played a nerdy guy on 'CSI: NY' for nine years. I want to be bad for a while. I want to be really, really bad.
I'm pretty lucky to work on both 'CSI: NY' and 'Supernatural.' Not bad gigs!
I was never really good in school.
When you boil down the real facts and statistics of what carbon dioxide is doing to this planet... to not feel like you have to do something... I don't think you're human.
There was a windstorm in L.A., and the morning after there was no smog, and I could see the mountains. And I was like... 'There's mountains? Snowcap mountains?' That's insane; I've been there for thirteen years, and I've never seen that view before, seeing the mountains in the distance.
My parents come down to Los Angeles a lot.
