Celebrity is something I've never been into, and never will be.
The only thing at the back of my mind is longevity, and I'm really lucky that I've constantly been in work since I left drama school.
Money's never an issue. I can go and work for a small studio theatre somewhere if it's a play I really care about, or do TV or a big commercial West End show.
