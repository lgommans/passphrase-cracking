I didn't have a clue where I was going on my first lap of practice.
I've always worked on the machines, especially the 125 and 250 which are really difficult to set up.
It was nothing, just the normal thing to do at the time.
One or two of the trips were a bit scary. Soldiers had me at gun point on one trip, locked me in my van all night and escorted me in and out of buildings when I wanted to wash.
