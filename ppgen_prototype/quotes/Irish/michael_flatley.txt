Irish,Dancer
I feel like a tiger right now. There's nothing impossible if you get up and work for it.
I'm proud of my Irish heritage and culture and this show will feature a lot of Irish dancing.
Anything is possible. I've got a few more miles in me. I'm not going to feel sorry for myself.
I would rather be having a burger and beers with my mates but I can't do that when I know I've got to dance.
Whenever I hear, 'It can't be done,' I know I'm close to success.
I'm at a stage in my life when I want a wife and a family.
Ideally if I settled down with a wife I would love to form my own troupe of mini dancers!
I wasn't even sure I'd be able to walk. I couldn't even go outside. Maybe I was just burnt crisp from the gruelling schedule I had been keeping for years.
I don't believe that when you are 25 you are over the hill. Fifty is the new 30.
