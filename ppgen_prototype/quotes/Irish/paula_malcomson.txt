A room full of hundreds, let alone thousands, of people is not my most fun thing in the world.
I'm pretty excited about the state of TV these days. There's great opportunity for really complicated relationships, in a way that I don't really see as much in movies anymore.
I try not to be too profane around children or old people. Other than that, that's how I speak.
If you're going to play a prostitute, you can't be too squeamish about that sort of thing. It's just part of the job, since the role requires it.
I just want to play strong characters, whatever that is in. For me, television is where it's at. You get to play a character for a long period of time, and you get to dig deep. It's a home to go to.
I'm not interested in a pretty world. It's boring to me. If you're lucky enough to get to play a character for a long time, it's life-changing.
Listen, I'm from Belfast. We're not polite people. And it's language. We're direct.
