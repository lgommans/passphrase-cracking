I am not naive enough to settle for anything less than a reasonable valuation of my worth.
I'm not at Manchester United to keep everyone happy.
When results aren't good the manager gets the sack, that's the game.
I think players tend to get anxious if they've not really done things properly - like eating, resting or training. If you're fully prepared you've got nothing to worry about - it's just a game of football.
I try and have a relaxed attitude and stay quite switched off until about an hour before kick-off.
I've had influences from many people including the coaches and players I've worked with.
Hopefully kids will look at me and see that your dreams can come true.
