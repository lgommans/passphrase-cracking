Irish,Actress
I did a film a few years ago where I gained a lot of weight for it. I was happy to do that because it was called for in the script.
I wouldn't do really gratuitous nudity. When I was in my late teens, you'd read stuff and be like, 'That character serves no purpose except being naked', so that would not be something I'd want to do. It's pointless for me.
If you think about it, there's very little about young families on TV, and yet there's so many of them.
I'm only ambitious in the sense that I want to work in as many different media as I can and to play characters which are different to me and to each other. I want to do work that frightens me or challenges me, be it in Dublin or Zimbabwe. I just want to be working.
I consider myself lucky to be going about my business doing something I love.
I love working in Dublin, but when I'm in London, I'm more focused on my career.
