Irish,Musician
I've been here all the time; I could be putting out as many albums as Costello, y'know what I mean?
I drink because I'm thirsty.
My dad has no control over who works with me. Me, me and me alone has to take responsibility for anything.
Petitions are ridiculous.
What I do is I'm a bandleader, frontman, entertainer.
When I'm writing a song, it gives me more actual pleasure to hear someone else sing it than do it meself.
