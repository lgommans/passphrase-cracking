I don't know how anyone could vote Republican. It's so obvious that their only interest is keeping the rich rich.
I still have people saying to me, 'Oh, you're still together?' They don't realize Leppard's been around this whole time, because people just don't get to hear us.
I actually knew I was going to be perfect for Def Leppard, sorry I hate to say that but I knew it.
Being a songwriter, singer, and a great part of a unit is more important than being Joe Guitar Hero.
And remember: without you, all we are is loud. No pressure.
If there is any justice in the world, then eighties rock will never again serve to blight humanity as it did in that dark decade!
Def Leppard is a rock band that can sing.
It's a lot more comfortable, I must say. Ummm, I didn't think I'd be playing with another band, I kinda thought I was through with that, but I make an exception because they're nice people.
I never had a real job either. I sort of fell out of school and ended up playing guitar.
I like my guitars to be kinda worn. I don't like it when they're all shiny.
I'm a big, big blues fan and the last several years I've really invested in the blues a lot, and I think my playing is getting better because of it - not necessarily better on a technical level, but certainly on a level of appropriateness.
The nature of touring is packaging acts together that have strong catalogues of music. It's about making sure that it's a winning combination. It's really about giving people value for their money.
The Internet has definitely opened doors and leveled the playing field for musicians.
Technology has made it much easier to make and manipulate music. Studio-driven, machine-driven music does not always transcend into being a good live act. Many current acts are great live, but many cannot cut it live. The music is not organic.
