Israeli,Designer
I have 'Happy Birthday' in multiple languages on my iPod - I like to play it at company birthday parties.
I very rarely wear suits, and only make one or two per season, so it's about wanting exceptional clothes that don't feel stiff. Fabric and garment washing are a big part of my design process for that reason. Everything needs to feel lived-in and comfortable.
It's just my aesthetic: to want to feel a bit undone, effortless but not without style.
I always have music playing in my studio when I design. It really gets me in the mood and allows me to focus.
I started out making personal pieces, and realized that I actually like designing. I am self-taught, so I had a lot to learn technically.
Kate Moss has great style.
I have been surfing since I was six years old.
