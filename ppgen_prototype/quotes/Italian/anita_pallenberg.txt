It's such a lonely existence, living with a rock n' roller. No matter how much he loves you, he will always love his music more.
I'm completely anti-establishment; the only thing I like about the Queen are her scarves and her jewels.
I grow vegetables - I'm a vegetarian; I've got strawberries, artichokes, leeks, broad beans.
Financially, I'm fine. But it's good to work. I'm not capable of doing nothing.
I don't like the fashion world. It's too nasty, too rip-off, too hard. And now it's all Gucci and Prada; it's very difficult to make your own business.
I had several publishers, and they were all the same. They all wanted salacious. And everybody is writing autobiographies, and that's one reason why I'm not going to do it. If young Posh Spice can write her autobiography, then I don't want to write one!
My son is very trendy and with-it, and he was the one who showed me 'Gummo.'
