Italian,Playwright
The blush is beautiful, but it is sometimes convenient.
A wise traveler never depreciates their own country.
Pretexts are not wanting when one wishes to use them.
He who never leaves his country is full of prejudices.
The world is a beautiful book, but of little use to him who cannot read it.
Noble bold is an accident of fortune; noble actions characterize the great.
He only half dies who leaves an image of himself in his sons.
He who talks much cannot talk well.
