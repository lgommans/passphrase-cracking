Italian,Poet
The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.
From a little spark may burst a flame.
There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.
Beauty awakens the soul to act.
Heat cannot be separated from fire, or beauty from The Eternal.
A mighty flame followeth a tiny spark.
The secret of getting things done is to act!
I wept not, so to stone within I grew.
Be as a tower firmly set; Shakes not its top for any blast that blows.
All hope abandon, ye who enter here!
Worldly fame is but a breath of wind that blows now this way, and now that, and changes name as it changes direction.
Remember tonight... for it is the beginning of always.
Pride, envy, avarice - these are the sparks have set on fire the hearts of all men.
In the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost.
You shall find out how salt is the taste of another man's bread, and how hard is the way up and down another man's stairs.
He listens well who takes notes.
I love to doubt as well as know.
Nature is the art of God.
Heaven wheels above you, displaying to you her eternal glories, and still your eyes are on the ground.
The sad souls of those who lived without blame and without praise.
At this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe.
Consider your origins: you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge.
No one thinks of how much blood it costs.
Art, as far as it is able, follows nature, as a pupil imitates his master; thus your art must be, as it were, God's grandchild.
The customs and fashions of men change like leaves on the bough, some of which go and others come.
O conscience, upright and stainless, how bitter a sting to thee is a little fault!
