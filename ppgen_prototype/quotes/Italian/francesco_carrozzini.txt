Italian,Photographer
I always saw photography as a way to get to film.
I'm not interested in just beautiful girls and beautiful clothes.
I'm more interested in photographing people who have done something, like writers or directors - even billionaires - as long as I can study them before I photograph them.
To me, the main and most exciting thing about photography is to meet people. The picture is the result of what happened between me and them on the set.
