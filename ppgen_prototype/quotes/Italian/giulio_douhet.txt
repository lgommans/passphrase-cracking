Italian,Soldier
To conquer the command of the air means victory; to be beaten in the air means defeat and acceptance of whatever terms the enemy may be pleased to impose.
The one effective method of defending one's own territory from an offensive by air is to destroy the enemy's air power with the greatest possible speed.
