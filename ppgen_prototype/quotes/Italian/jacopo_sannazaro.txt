Italian,Poet
Man is only miserable so far as he thinks himself so.
He ploughs the waves, sows the sand, and hopes to gather the wind in a net, who places his hopes in the heart of a woman.
Envy, my son, wears herself away, and droops like a lamb under the influence of the evil eye.
Most learned of the fair, most fair of the learned.
There is no evil in the world without a remedy.
