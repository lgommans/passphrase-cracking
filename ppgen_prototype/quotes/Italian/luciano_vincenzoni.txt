Italian,Writer
Do you imagine Sergio Leone with a philosophy? Come on! He was a primitive of movies, a great director on set.
To be a director, you have to be especially patient.
I have written movies that won prizes at Cannes and Venice.
Do you know how long it took me to write 'For a Few Dollars More'? Nine days.
