Italian,Poet
We consume our tomorrows fretting about our yesterdays.
He conquers who endures.
Oh, what a void there is in things.
Is any man free except the one who can pass his life as he pleases?
Out of nothing can come, and nothing can become nothing.
And don't consult anyone's opinions but your own.
Each man has his own desires; all do not possess the same inclinations.
Tomorrow is the day when idlers work, and fools reform, and mortal men lay hold on heaven.
