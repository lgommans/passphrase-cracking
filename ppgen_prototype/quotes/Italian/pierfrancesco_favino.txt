Italian,Actor
As an actor, what you really want to do is communicate with people - this is my aim, my principle aim.
You don't really work for awards, but when they come it's... nice.
To me, the word 'hero' hasn't got positive or negative value - 'hero' is the person who leads you through the story.
In general, I think you can watch a movie in two different ways. One is the ethical point of view, one is the point of view of the story.
I know that when you talk about something that may hurt someone, reactions are normal, and you are touching some nerves... But I don't do things because people always like what I do.
You know, I think that people give you back what you gave them. I try to be... as I am.
