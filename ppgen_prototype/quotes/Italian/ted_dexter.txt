Endless cricket, like endless anything else, simply grinds you down.
I think we are all slightly down in the dumps after another loss. We may be in the wrong sign... Venus may be in the wrong juxtaposition with somewhere else.
Sympathetic cracks. A term frequently used by architects and surveyors in terms of ageing houses. I know what they mean.
The whole of our national sport is not doing very well.
Once again our cricketers have flattered to deceive in Australia.
