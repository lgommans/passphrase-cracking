Italian,Poet
Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing.
True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does.
The day of fortune is like a harvest day, We must be busy when the corn is ripe.
Love is when you don't have to be with another person to touch their heart!
Grave was the man in years, in looks, in word, his locks were grey, yet was his courage green.
Any time not spent on love is wasted.
It is the fortunate who should extol fortune.
Fortune rarely accompanies anyone to the door.
None merits the name of Creator but God and the poet.
