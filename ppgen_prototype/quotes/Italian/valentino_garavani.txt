Italian,Designer
I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business.
I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing with them over the years, but always staying on the same track.
I love my beauty. It's not my fault.
An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.
I like things simple.
I hope people will say, 'Mr. Valentino, he did something for fashion, no?'
I know what women want. They want to be beautiful.
I am always locked in my design studio.
There are only three things I can do - make a dress, decorate a house, and entertain people.
I have my favourite fashion decade, yes, yes, yes: '60s. It was a sort of little revolution; the clothes were amazing but not too exaggerated.
I didn't like the '80s at all; it was a vulgar moment of fashion.
I love the 2000s because everyone started to love haute couture.
Unfortunately, the greatest photographers don't pay extreme attention to the clothes. If they decide to put a dress in a bathtub or in front of a cow in the countryside with dirt everywhere, well, the dresses come back... ready to be put in the garbage.
My first year, people were interested in me because I was new. Then the press started to come.
Even as a young boy, my passion was to design, and I have been very lucky to be able to do what I have loved all my life. There can be few greater gifts than that.
I am happy that thousands of students, young designers and fashion people will be able to see and study my work in every aspect of it.
