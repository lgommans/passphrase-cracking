Italian,Athlete
I'd say I'm quite powerful so I'm not afraid of jumps or acrobatic elements. The hardest part is... get on the beam and stay there on top of it!
The Ferrari is a beautiful car. It's great.
I'd like to go out with friends, but I train twice a day, then I go to school, and at night I go home.
