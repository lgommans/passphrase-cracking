Italian,Dramatist
Deep vengeance is the daughter of deep silence.
Disgrace does not consist in the punishment, but in the crime.
To err is human; but contrition felt for the crime distinguishes the virtuous from the wicked.
Often the test of courage is not to die but to live.
A usurper always distrusts the whole world.
First thoughts are not always the best.
Heaven takes care that no man secures happiness by crime.
Liars are always most disposed to swear.
Ofttimes the test of courage becomes rather to live than to die.
Where there are laws, he who has not broken them need not tremble.
