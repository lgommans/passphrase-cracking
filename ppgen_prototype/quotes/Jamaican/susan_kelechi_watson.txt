Some of the joy in acting is switching it up: being able to do something that's different than what you've been doing.
There is nothing like being able to develop a three-dimensional character over a long period of time. Sometimes you aren't able to fully portray a character because you only have a couple of scenes to do it in, and you don't get the full life and background of that character.
I trained in theater. I loved Los Angeles, but I've found New York to be successful for me.
I don't know that I constantly think about being a black woman.
This is an age where you could put anything on YouTube; people can make films on their own.
That's always fun to play: the person who can be truthful and blunt, and people take it because that's who she is.
I'm the ultimate studier of comedy. I grew up in a very funny household. My dad is the king of one-liners; my brothers are great at telling stories, and my mom is funny without knowing it.
As you build your career, you know where you want to go. I'm definitely moving towards films. That's definitely a goal. I'm definitely going to put it out there.
