Japanese,Athlete
As a professional athlete, I believe that I need to explore my opportunities to the maximum, in order to excel and continue to play the best football I can.
I notice that teams are now more interested in Japanese players than when I first went to Europe.
I think that the World Cup is a big factor for this increased interest. I don't believe all of this is a result of just myself but also because of the others who are playing abroad.
I will never again stand on the pitch as a professional player. But I won't stop playing the game.
Living in Europe, I was surprised to find out just how little everyone knows about Japan.
The biggest lesson I've learned by living abroad for the last four years is the importance of communication.
We had only snacks last time, I think it was OK for a day time menu. But this time it will be late night when people gather so we should add some proper meals.
