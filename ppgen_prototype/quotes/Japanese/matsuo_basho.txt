Japanese,Poet
Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home.
The temple bell stops but I still hear the sound coming out of the flowers.
Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought.
There is nothing you can see that is not a Bashoflower; there is nothing you can think that is not the moon.
The moon is brighter since the barn burned.
