Japanese,Writer
People have talents that are different. Where does the creative flow come from - inside us or from a higher power? I don't ask any questions. I just write it down.
I always want to live long enough to finish the book I'm working on and see it published. But then I start another book before the previous one is in the stores, so I always have a reason to go on.
A writer is what I am.
I offer optimism. All my books have happy endings. I don't see any point in letting my readers down at the end. I'm an optimist - people feel that in my books.
I tell a good story.
I didn't learn to drive until I was 65 and my husband was seriously ill.
Getting the ideas are a struggle for me. I'm doing better now that I use the concentration tapes. More unusual ideas.
The girls in my books are out solving their own problems.
I've always done what I wanted to do.
I like to write about beautiful places, interesting places to me.
I wish I could think of a suitable name for the kind of writing I do.
