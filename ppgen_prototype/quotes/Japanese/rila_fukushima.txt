I have a weakness for buttons. I'm always collecting ornate and nicely decorated ones.
Traveling for modeling has been great, but I never really have much time to live the tourist life while in all the different cities.
I had been taking acting classes on and off while I was modeling, so I always had a dream to be in a film.
I never thought about acting before I started modeling, but since then I've been in short films and music videos, and I got interested. It felt natural to switch over.
I actually wanted to become a model agent, and went into what ended up becoming my first agency for a job interview. They ended up suggesting I model instead. I guess I sort of fell into it.
I like people-watching and getting inspiration from the unique people who don't follow any fashion tides. From 12-year-olds who have full freedom, to 86-year-old ladies with a ton of class.
