Japanese,Chef
The best way to make a steak is grilled over an open flame or pan sauteed in a cast iron skillet.
You know what, I don't really watch a lot of cooking shows, but what's great about them is that it inspires a lot of the younger generation so, you know, with cooking shows and reality shows and the social media, I think it really makes our industry a hotter industry.
I like working with fish, so naturally I like seafood.
I love showing my personality in my cooking.
See, I'm a believer that people are born with a sense of cooking. It's something within them that really gives them the ability to create and to understand flavors.
You don't go to school to become the best chef in the world right after you graduate. School is always a starting point so what people forget is that you go to school to build a foundation, and you want to build a foundation that's not going to crumble.
