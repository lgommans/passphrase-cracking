Architects have made architecture too complex. We need to simplify it and use a language that everyone can understand.
We have to base architecture on the environment.
I sometimes feel that we are losing an intuitive sense of our own bodies.
Because there are a lot of big cities in the world, people who live in cities have become more isolated than ever.
I would like to use architecture to create bonds between people who live in cities, and even use it to recover the communities that used to exist in every single city.
Children don't run around outside as much as they did. They sit in front of computer games.
The dreams of the 1960s began to disappear in the 1970s. The economy collapsed, and so did the optimism of the Metabolists.
There are so many constraints on the architect that public buildings almost never feel free or enjoyable.
