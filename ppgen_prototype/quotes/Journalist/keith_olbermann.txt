I guess the painkillers wipe out your memory along with your ethics.
I can't think of an instance at MSNBC where anything I said on the air was influenced by what was going on behind the scenes.
Our country is wounded and bleeding now if we don't know whether or not habeas corpus exists.
Fox News is hated because they're elitists, and the worst winners television's ever seen.
Even on the greatest teams, there's always one role player.
Reagan's dead, and he was a lousy President.
At Current, television is all we do - that's our business. We don't have amusement parks I have to worry about, we don't have environmental cases against us, we don't have a series of outdoor-advertising companies.
It's not about 'NBC is evil.' It's about that media structure - CBS, ABC, CNN, even some of the smaller operations are now multinationals, with these extraordinarily diverse holdings.
The corporation is one of the great unheralded human inventions of destruction. It is a way to absolve from any personal liability a bunch of people. They form together in a massive ID and they do whatever they want.
All the things that people like me supposedly don't do, I do.
Once the Republicans get rolling, they assume they're going to win everything. They are zealots, and zealots assume the last five percent of whatever their plan is will be taken care of by their own greatness or momentum or divinity.
I'm not an anarchist. I believe in government.
I have achieved what I wanted to achieve. I'm better off at some sort of independent place where they not only like what I produce but also trust me to be the one to produce it.
I'm a natural management guy. I had forgotten that. And I forgot how much I hate it.
As part of the process by which you hire me, you hire me. You just don't hire an hour of me to do a performance.
I stand up to people.
I'm difficult for management. That's why I have the reputation because nobody challenges management.
