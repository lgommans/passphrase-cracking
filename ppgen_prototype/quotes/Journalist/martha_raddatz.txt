I try so hard not to think that I am a stranger in a strange land. But I know that I stand out.
I can't pretend to be objective when it comes to service or sacrifice.
I will stay in the car until the last minute that I'm going to jump out and do a standup or jump out and do some interviews.
I have two children. They're grown children. I don't think they particularly enjoy it when I'm in a dangerous situation, but they also understand that this is something I feel strongly about. It's what I've done my whole life.
I don't want anything bad to happen to me.
