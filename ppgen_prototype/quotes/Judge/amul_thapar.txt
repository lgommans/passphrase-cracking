Keeping politics out of the courtroom is a goal every state aspires to achieve.
The solution to voters potentially being misled by a judicial candidate's political speech is more speech - not government censorship.
I don't have the wherewithal to judge God's will. I don't have the wherewithal to determine whether your viewpoints are right or wrong.
