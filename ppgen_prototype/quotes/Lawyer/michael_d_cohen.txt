People change their positions all the time, the way they change their wives.
If somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn't like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump's benefit. If you do something wrong, I'm going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I'm not going to let go until I'm finished.
Mr. Trump's memory is fantastic. I've never come across a situation that Mr. Trump has said something that is not accurate.
In all honesty, Hilary Clinton can't fill a Starbucks even if they offered free ventis.
We are in really bad shape as a country. We are not respected around the world. We are not respected in our own country.
Mr. Trump never made any derogatory or disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants... He was talking about Mexico. They're allowing people to pour through their borders, and that's a problem for our national security.
Donald Trump is actually the voice of the silent majority, and I think he's awoken that silent majority. People are very angry, and the people who are the most angry are actually the legal immigrants who see their jobs fleeing.
Donald Trump is a champion for legal immigrants.
I'm obviously very loyal and very dedicated to Mr. Trump. I think he's going to be not just a good president, I think he's going to be a great president.
Mr. Trump is more than just a boss to those of us who have been fortunate enough to be close to him, both professionally and personally. He's more like a patriarch, a mentor. These qualities make him very endearing to me, which is why I am so fiercely loyal to him and committed to protecting him at all costs.
