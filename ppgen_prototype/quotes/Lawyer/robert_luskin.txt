At the request of the special counsel, Mr. Rove will not discuss the substance of his testimony.
The expectations are that when this investigation is completed, Fitzgerald will make the appropriate decision, which is not to charge Karl with any criminal offenses.
The one thing that's absolutely clear is that Karl was not the source for the leak and there's no basis for any additional speculation.
The reason this resolution was delayed had nothing to do with anything Karl did or failed to do.
The special counsel has not advised Mr. Rove that he is a target of the investigation and affirmed that he has made no decision concerning charges.
