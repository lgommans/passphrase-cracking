Leader
I am an international leader, the dean of the Arab rulers, the king of kings of Africa and the imam of Muslims, and my international status does not allow me to descend to a lower level.
Nations whose nationalism is destroyed are subject to ruin.
I am a Bedouin warrior who brought glory to Libya and will die a martyr.

I cannot recognise either the Palestinian state or the Israeli state. The Palestinians are idiots and the Israelis are idiots.

I do not support peace in the Middle East. And I do not support Arafat. He is a stupid, incompetent fool!
Libya has had to put up with too much from the Arabs for whom it has poured forth both blood and money.
Those who do not love me do not deserve to live.
We have been terrorised by what happened in America and we express our condolences to the American people who suffered from this unexpected catastrophe and a new world war.
We are telling the American people to have patience, courage, resolve and determination.
There is no state with a democracy except Libya on the whole planet.
All right, then nobody can complain if we ask pregnant women to make parachute jumps.
