We plan to eliminate the state of Israel and establish a purely Palestinian state. We will make life unbearable for Jews by psychological warfare and population explosion. We Palestinians will take over everything, including all of Jerusalem.
Peace for us means the destruction of Israel. We are preparing for an all-out war, a war which will last for generations.
I come bearing an olive branch in one hand, and the freedom fighter's gun in the other. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand.
Whoever stands by a just cause cannot possibly be called a terrorist.
It's always convenient for certain people to heap accusations on Israel.
Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.
Palestine is the cement that holds the Arab world together, or it is the explosive that blows it apart.
The victory march will continue until the Palestinian flag flies in Jerusalem and in all of Palestine.
Whoever thinks of stopping the uprising before it achieves its goals, I will give him ten bullets in the chest.
This is my homeland no one can kick me out.
The Palestinian Rifle is ready and we will aim it if they try to prevent us from praying in Jerusalem.
In order to obtain the goal of returning to Palestine, all of us sometimes have to grit our teeth.
