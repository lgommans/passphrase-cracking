Lebanese,Designer
My personality resembles my designs to a large extent. I'm in sync with myself and I'm transparent, just like my designs.
I traced the path I walk today and my goals are many. I think that I'm achieving my goals.
If I hadn't been a determined person I wouldn't have succeeded in life.
Worldwide is an overused word. But it's true that being known has given me new ideas and a chance to get to know new people who think in different ways. I want to hear myself referred to as Elie Saab, without labels or titles.
I liken myself to someone who built the house he will live in one day and is preparing to furnish it.
