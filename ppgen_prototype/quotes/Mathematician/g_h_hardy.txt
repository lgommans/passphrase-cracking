Young men should prove theorems, old men should write books.
Pure mathematics is on the whole distinctly more useful than applied. For what is useful above all is technique, and mathematical technique is taught mainly through pure mathematics.
I wrote a great deal... but very little of any importance; there are not more than four of five papers which I can still remember with some satisfaction.
I was at my best at a little past forty, when I was a professor at Oxford.
There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.
