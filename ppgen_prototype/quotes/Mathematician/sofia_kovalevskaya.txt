Russian,Mathematician
Many who have had an opportunity of knowing any more about mathematics confuse it with arithmetic, and consider it an arid science. In reality, however, it is a science which requires a great amount of imagination.
It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.
Say what you know, do what you must, come what may.
