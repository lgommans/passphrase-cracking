Polish,Mathematician
Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit.
One can imagine that the ultimate mathematician is one who can see analogies between analogies.
Mathematics is as old as Man.
A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs and the best mathematician can notice analogies between theories.
