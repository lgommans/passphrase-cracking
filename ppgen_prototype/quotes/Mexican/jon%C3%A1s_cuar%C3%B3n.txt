In college, when a girlfriend asks you to watch a film in black and white, you do it. That's when I discovered a lot of films. I was really obsessed with Bergman, the whole world he creates. One that I always quote a lot is 'Autumn Sonata.' When you see women go through issues with their mom, you realize how right and poignant Bergman was.
When I did my first film, I was in college; I did it as a senior thesis. The original version was 60 minutes. But I developed it and made it almost 90 minutes. In 2007, it premiered in Venice, and I stopped in London to develop a script with my dad that fell apart, and we started 'Gravity.'
My wife likes me better when I'm writing. It centers me and makes me more calm. When I go a long time without writing, I start getting frustrated.
As a writer, being on the set of 'Gravity' was such a surreal experience. It was nice to see them using the technology to translate what we had on the page.
