Czechoslovakian,Model
A photo is a creation.
We are very isolated, far from boyfriends and friends, so we have to be strong, smart and very professional.
Because beauty isn't enough, there must be something more.
I do pottery. I love it. It's very relaxing; it takes me to another planet.
For me, it's a compliment to be compared with Marilyn, the unforgettable actress, the most beautiful one of all. But, curves aside, we have very little in common.
I'm lucky, I don't like sweets, not even chocolate.
My dream is to have a beautiful old house in Monaco.
I love photo sessions. I'm alone, I'm the queen, everyone's taking care of me.
I rarely do masks because, if I have any extra time, I'd rather spend it with my friends than on myself.
But I was very much into sports when I was a child.
But I love fish, cheese and meat, and I eat everything, but only in small quantities if it's rich.
I especially love French, Italian and Japanese cuisines.
But for the time being, I've only learned one cake recipe and how to make scrambled eggs.
Yes, I was really good in physics and in math.
History is the key to everything: politics, religion, even fashion.
Six months later I was in Paris. I was 16, and it all started to happen.
I play a role in front of the cameras, just like in the movies.
I'm even embarrassed at times when my friends come upon my pictures.
I didn't have to undergo reconstructive surgery.
I'm very serious; I don't waste my earnings.
I put my money in the bank: I have to think of life after modeling, when I'm not famous any more.
But I also like to shower my parents with presents. I bought them a beautiful car and a house.
I don't think I ever had a swollen head: I remember where I come from.
My mother's a secretary; my father's an electrician in a mining company.
I'm lucky, I can sleep from takeoff until we land; so I'm fresh, rested and ready to work on arrival.
We're constantly buying airplane tickets; we travel on the Concorde.
