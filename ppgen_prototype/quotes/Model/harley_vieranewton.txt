American,Model
I love coming to London and seeing what people on the street are wearing.
I like everything from Miu Miu. Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dresses are a party essential; they're so flattering.
I put everything into my hand luggage! Really, I do!
I like to mix British classics, like a great trench, with fun vintage pieces I find in New York. L.A. style is often very relaxed and comfortable, and I appreciate that effortless feel.
I started D.J.-ing my first year of college just for fun and to pay bills.
Modeling has always played off my D.J.-ing, but it is a fun supplement.
Fashion and music have always played off each other and certainly do for me; I love both so much. But there are definitely those moments when you're playing the right song at the right time in the right place, and it feels like the best job in the world.
My mother is a proud Brazilian. I love visiting my family in Rio; the city and its people are so vibrant and amazing.
I was definitely surrounded by music and fashion at a very, very young age.
My grandmother impressed upon me the importance of family, and my grandfather encouraged my hunger for learning.
Don't take yourself too seriously! You only live once!
