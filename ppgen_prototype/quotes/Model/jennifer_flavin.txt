American,Model
I am a serious businesswoman. I don't enjoy being out there on TV; it's not what I do well. But I love building companies; I love making products.
I didn't grow up beautiful.
I knew that if-God forbid-anything ever happened in my life, I needed to know how to take care of myself.
I could have had my husband put me on a lot of TV shows every day, but I chose not to. I am a serious businesswoman. I don't enjoy being out there on TV; it's not what I do well.
I love building companies; I love making products.
I have had no plastic surgery on my face. Can I leave it at that?
I do believe in exercise and eating right. And I'm not an avid exerciser. I exercise twice a week.
I developed acne when I was about 19, at the beginning of my modeling career. I didn't have the huge cystic-type of acne, but a lot of little bumps all over my face. They were small, but you could see them in photographs. You can't have acned skin and work as a model.
I'd rather be a great mom than a sexy model.
Hairdressers don't judge you. They pretty much accept everything because they've heard everything. They're on your side, like a cheerleader, and there's no competition. They don't want to be you, and you don't want to be them.
