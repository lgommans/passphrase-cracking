Czechoslovakian,Model
Simply enjoy life and the great pleasures that come with it.
Love yourself instead of abusing yourself.
Hiking in undiscovered places is a lot of fun.
Remember who you are and where you come from; otherwise, you don't know where you are going.
It is up to us to make the right choice and the right decisions.
The beauty comes with the balance. Everyone should find his own balance in his personal as well as his professional life. Once you do so, you will feel and look beautiful.
Mother Nature made me the way I am, and I should be happy.
Whenever I'm free, I spend time with people I love, people that inspire me in many different ways.
What I love the most about modeling is that it opens you a lot of different doors of opportunities and takes you to many different places, which then put you in touch with various people and cultures.
Unfortunately, modeling takes you with no transition from being a girl to being a business woman.
There is the glamour side of it, which allows you to meet great variety of people with whom you simply can have a good time, but there's also the sad side of it that drags you into a superficial and artificial world.
There are so many people I wish I could have met:
My acting coach makes the impossible accessible.
Music is another great pleasure of life. I like all sorts.
It's a very hard and competitive business in which you have to fight every day in order to impose yourself.
I was fortunate enough to visit a lot of beautiful places around the world. The most astonishing and memorable experiences were my trips to Africa and Australia.
I hope to continue building my acting career and work more on projects that fulfill my artistic thirst.
A girl who is interested in becoming a model must first accept the fact that she is the product. She must be ready to deal with a lot of rejection.
