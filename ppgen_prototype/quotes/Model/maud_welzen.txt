Model
I was discovered in Paris when I was there on a school trip at the age of 13. After that, my mom came in contact with Elite Amsterdam; then I started modeling.
I like to eat yogurt in the morning. It's easy and quick and available anywhere.
I really would like to work with kids if I was not a model.
Once I found a mouse under my bed in an apartment in Paris. I am terrified of mice! I couldn't sleep for days.
I listen to a lot of different kinds of music and at the moment I listen a lot to house music.
I like to read dramatic novels and I absolutely love magazines.
I like Sultana cookies - they are so, so, so good. I think the best in the world.
