Sometimes, I sit down to sketch at the unearthly hour of 3 in the morning!
I used to love dogs until I discovered cats.
I love being photographed, I love the ramp.
I was a little nervous backstage. But I had this book, Gandhi. I just read his quotes, closed my eyes and focused my thoughts. Presently, this book is my prized possession.
Ummm, there is not just one good thing about being a VJ, it is a package deal. It is a fun job and you get paid to party and have a good time and make people have a good time, which is great.
I have always loved animals since I was very young.
I didn't want to get into acting. I was very happy doing MTV, it took up my time, I was content.
Winning is very important to me. I wouldn't be happy with anything less. And I work towards my goal.
The greatest injustice in the world is to bring a child into the world, and not be able to offer it peace.
People feel I don't mix much, but I'm working at it.
Most important was to remain focused and always have presence of mind.
I won the crown for what I am - I'm certainly not going to let go of that!
Deep inside, I was hoping I'd win: The competition was tough, but I learned from other's mistakes.
