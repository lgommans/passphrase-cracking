Spanish,Model
I had a few pimples here and there when I was 14. Never had braces though, thank God. A girl in my class had, like, the big helmet of head gear. I felt so bad for her. People always made fun of me enough because of my name.
The weirdest I've felt was my first job ever. It was an editorial in London. They made me take my underwear off and cover myself with a shower curtain. It was almost see-through, so I was like, 'What's this all about?' I used to be quite shy, but modeling has made me more comfortable in those types of situations.
I surf; that's how I stay healthy - not because of the gym.
When I first came to New York, I was so bored. My friends were like, 'Do a blog. It's the hip thing to do for male models.'
People say the top part of my face looks like my dad's and the bottom part like my mom's. I have his eyes and her nose and mouth.
