I watched 'A Chorus Line' over and over when I was growing up, to the point that I was able to recite the entire movie.
I mean, when you grow up dancing, you have to become very comfortable in your own skin.
Jet-skiing is my favorite water sport.
I grew up very much an athlete and very much a swimmer and a dancer and a horse rider and surf lifesaving club, you name it I've probably done it. I just find so much gratification in being physical.
I don't like auditions. I feel like they're a very unnatural setting and it's a very unsettling experience. Because you can't help but walk in and feel like you're trying to prove yourself to people. And you should just walk in and be.
I'm just the highest energy person I know, and it's really weird.
I was a dancer for fifteen years, and I think a lot of what dancing gives you crosses over so much into anything to do with fighting, martial arts, anything action.
