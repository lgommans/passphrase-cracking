I listen to Helmet - and I love Helmet, they're a great band - but every song sounds the same.
I seriously do not think Nirvana is grunge.
I think putting labels on people is just an easy way of marketing something you don't understand.
I think people like Steve Vai are so boring.
We're more into expressing ourselves than making radio hits.
I'm my own worst critic and I think everyone in the band is a perfectionist.
Fine art is really something I want to get into.
With four perfectionists in the band, we have a hard time reaching perfection.
When we played with the Rollins Band, we'd keep songs going until we felt like ending it.
We wanted to take as much time and effort making the video as we did the song.
We have meetings with our record label to tell them how to market us.
We could have gone with much bigger labels and more money, but we wanted to go with a company that is LA based, all in the same building, and really understands what the artists want.
The Melvins are grunge.
That's what I love about our music - it'll never be a hit because you can't dance to it.
That's the thing I like about my sound. It's real raw and very unsafe compared to a solid state kind of sound.
My approach is to be part of a band that makes music, not hit songs.
Many of the songs on Undertow were written at the time Opiate came out.
If I play anything that sounds like a solo, it's gonna sound like a lyric.
I've never worried about how long the song is.
I've always dabbled on guitar, but never took lessons.
I'm not into solos, I'm into lyrics.
I'm not a good guitar player.
I'm not a geek about equipment, I just know what I like.
I'm a bass player from way back and Paul is a guitar player and we've been in many bands.
I use Gibson guitars; I prefer the Les Paul custom.
I played violin and got into that Suzuki program in the second grade.
