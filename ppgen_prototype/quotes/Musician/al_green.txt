I'm thankful for every moment.
Suicide is not an answer, it's destruction.
Some people believe that fairness comes with obeying the rules. I'm one of those people.
The music is the message, the message is the music. So that's my little ministry that the Big Man upstairs gave to me - a little ministry called love and happiness.
If I could live my life all over I'd do everything the same; the film in my camera would remain the same; there's no way lord, to leave this love behind.
I learned more stuff in church than I did in the world.
No child wants to fail. Everyone wants to succeed.
I have found people on both sides of the aisle, white and black, that'll give you the shirt off their back. And I've also found people that won't give you a piece of bread if you're starving to death.
Pakistan's being an ally and helping the United States, we ought to show Pakistan that we are appreciative for the help that's been extended.
Teach success before teaching responsibility. Teach them to believe in themselves. Teach them to think, 'I'm not stupid'. No child wants to fail. Everyone wants to succeed.
I didn't have a mother; I had a mama. I measure other women by the stature of my mama.
People still come up to me and ask me to sign their records. That's right, records! Man, they don't even make records no more!
