The evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming.
We measure our days out in steps of uncertainty not turning to see how far we've come. And peer down the highway from here to eternity and reach out for love on the run.
Look to the past and remember no empire rises that sooner or later won't fall.
Looking so cool, his greed is hard to conceal, he's fresh out of law school, you gave him a license to steal.
Nothing that's forced can ever be right, if it doesn't come naturally, leave it.
You reach out your hand, but you're all alone, in those time passages.
Jimi Hendrix played loud and free, Sergeant Pepper was real to me.
Whoever you pretend to be, you must face yourself eventually.
Louis Armstrong playing trumpet on the Judgment Day.
Only two to three per cent of an audience is interested in words and pays attention to lyrics; most of the rest of it is about image or the beat or the sound, or else it's a tribal thing - country & western, rap, heavy metal, with historical folk rock off in some kind of cult.
There's room in the world for one historical folk-rock singer to make a decent living, and I happen to be it.
All those people who go to NASCAR and sing country & western songs and live in Tennessee, they totally ignore me, they don't come to my shows, I just don't exist for them and they don't exist for me.
I know there's a big bad world out there, but I rarely come across it.
