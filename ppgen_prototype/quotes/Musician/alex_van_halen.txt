We're having a blast. Just four friends getting together.
You come to the planet with nothing and you leave with nothing, so you'd better do some good while you are here.
Whatever our personal differences are, there are no bigger fans of this band than the people who are in this band.
It's part of our nature. As much as I love (brother and guitarist Eddie), if you put us in a room with no one else for 15 minutes, we'd be at each other's throats.
Music is a dialogue.
We're very needy people, you know.
Nobody sets out to make a bad record.
The Beatles will never get back together and David Lee Roth will never again sing with Van Halen.
Some things are impossible.
Everybody has a high point and a lot goes into that: timing, situation, general consciousness.
When you leave the planet, you leave music behind.
You don't leave behind box office scores or how many dollars changed hands.
Van Halen is a work in progress.
Meaning that if you live in the moment, so to speak, we play today, and tonight we're done.
When the tour is done, that's the end of the U.S. tour. We'll regroup and see what we're going to do.
There is a volatile mix, and that's because we're all intense. And there's no denying that.
On a personal level, we all get along fine.
There's nothing worse than having everybody thinking alike, talking alike and having the same direction in mind. It gets stale that way.
It's unfortunate nine years were in between - you can't take that time back; you can't undo it.
Yeah, we have our differences, but we put those aside, and now we're making music. It's great.
At our age, you don't want to stop.
Sammy and I got together and it was like we hadn't missed a beat.
