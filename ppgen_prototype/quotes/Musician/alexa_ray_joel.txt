American,Musician
There's no great shame in having your nose fixed.
My parents tried to shield me from how famous they were when I was growing up on Long Island. I had no idea.
What people don't understand is that my dad isn't up on the contemporary music scene. He's been a legend for decades and he doesn't know what's going on right now, and he doesn't need to.
I worked a long time to get good at what I'm doing, and nobody handed me a recording contract because of who my father is.
I like songs that sound like classics. There are songs that might be cooler or have better production, but I like songs that sound like they're timeless.
