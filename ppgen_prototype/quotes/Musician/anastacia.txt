I wear glasses, have a big scar, I sing loud, and I am blond. I'm sorry!
To make a difference is just... I think... the purpose of what life is.
I live a very real life.
I'm a fighter by nature and nothing will ever change that.
Once someone asked me three words that best describe me and I said 'Loud, Louder, and Loudest'!
