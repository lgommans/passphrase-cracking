Whether it's a 16-year old girl, or a mom, or a guy, or anybody, as long as they come up and they're excited to meet me 'cause they've had some sort of relationship with something I've created, it's the coolest thing ever. It never gets old. It's awesome.
As a musician, you just want to be able to do what you love.
I don't really think in terms of goals.
You have to do what you want to do, and I genuinely believe that if you start interacting in the world that way that there is a respect in that.
To be a good musician, you need to give people what they want, what they need.
Well, there are two kinds of happiness, grounded and ungrounded. Ungrounded happiness is cheesy and not based on reality. Grounded happiness is informed happiness based on the knowledge that the world sometimes sucks, but even then you have to believe in yourself.
I'm a humble guy, but I'm audacious.
I am so blessed and lucky.
