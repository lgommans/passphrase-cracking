We teach about how to drive in school, but not how to manage finances.
I never tried to sing like anybody else, fortunately I didn't sound like anybody else. It just happened.
You've got to live life to write a book about it.
I made up my mind several years ago that I had worked very hard to get to where I am in life and that I was only going to do things that are fun and exciting.
The important things are children, honesty, integrity and faith.
I still think I'm not as good as anybody else.
There's no doubt in my mind that people on the West Coast - L.A. particularly - and the East Coast have no clue at all about what's happening outside their own little bailiwick. And they think everybody is stupid because they are not sophisticated.
I guess I've never really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be.
I'll keep going until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage.
