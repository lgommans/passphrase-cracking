Musician
I have absolutely no desire and no thought of quitting ever.
I sang for my family. And I think probably the first time I sang and got paid for it, I was about 6 or 7.
On Saturday afternoons, there was a film, of course, and then we did about four shows between the films. And I would do a tap dance, a little military tap.
I look back at photographs and I remember at the time I thought I was not very attractive.
I remember feeling that. I couldn't do, nor did I want to do, the kinds of roles I'd been doing.
Young people who are just starting out somehow need to let you know they know how to sing.
Even within the last three or four years, I have a greater ability to communicate, I think. I have more courage to show the stuff... And it does take courage.
New Year's Eve, we're going to be doing a concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Symphony Hall. It makes me feel good, because of all the people they could have had, they wanted me! We do have to do a little work with the rhythm section.
