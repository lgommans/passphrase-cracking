American,Musician
I was like the good girl, bad girl, there were no grey areas for me.
You don't have to be age 20 and size zero to be sexually viable or viable as a woman.
I mean, in rock music terms I'm like a dinosaur.
Life's too short to be a Go-Go for twenty years.
It will shock many - I've lived a full life and really enjoyed my time as a pop star.
However, if you listen to me I think you can hear years of abuse in my voice - both bad abuse and good abuse.
I had no musical training at all.
I just liked the idea of being engaged.
