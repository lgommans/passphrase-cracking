American,Musician
I don't listen to a lot of radio today. It's not really music to me.
I got private lessons in keyboard at Julliard, before New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.
I talk by playing, not by words.
I was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and no one had ever taught anybody that young, back in those days.
I was born with a natural gift. My mother recognized the talent.
My mother wanted me to be a concert pianist.
People like my voice and say I can sing, but I don't like microphones in front of my face: it distracts me.
Prince presented us at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Providence School of Art students used to sneak into P Funk concerts.
The radios are going to dictate. That's another fight. That's another story there. I wish they just let it be.
We used to have a main female vocalist. But she had a baby. Now we do the singing ourselves.
You can be enticed by food, wooed by food, sex, money, or instruments.
As far as arrangements after the basic track is cut, if I'm writing a horn arrangement or playing strings, I might arrange that, plan that out. Other times, I'll just sit and roll tape.
Woo means the ability to entice someone or something to get what you want. My first solo album was called: All the Woo of the Universe, which was titled by George Clinton.
I was known around the college for jamming in the lounge.
Usually, I just do what I want, because I got it that way.
