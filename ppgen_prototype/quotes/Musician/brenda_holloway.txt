Then when Gladys Knight came in to do my songs that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
Success to me was getting out of that contract in one piece.
My costumes were made for sex appeal not for women.
Motown's policy was to build one act at a time or their favorites.
I was a black singer with a white voice, a perfect pop voice.
I feel Motown really exploited me.
A lot of times I can across as too masculine to men, and they couldn't handle me, they stayed away.
