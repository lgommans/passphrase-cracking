Australian,Musician
When you meet someone for the first time, that's not the whole book. That's just the first page.
We loved Andy, so we wanted to keep him. He was in both bands, but Nerve Agents broke up.
We drink VB, Victoria Bitter, which is way better.
We also listen to PJ Harvey; a lot of driving music. You need something a little more relaxing in the car.
It's not important to how the band functions or to what we do. That's just many people's opinions on what they see. A lot of people project stuff on you, but that's okay.
I really wanted to work hard on my lyrics.
I guess to just keep playing music; to just keep outdoing the last record.
Dante didn't work out, and then we found Ryan. He worked at a comic, record and toy store in Fremont.
All I've ever wanted to do was play music and go on the road and make records.
A drummer is usually like the backbone.
