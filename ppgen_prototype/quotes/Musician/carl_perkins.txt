American,Musician
If it weren't for the rocks in its bed, the stream would have no song.
After all those days in the cotton fields, the dreams came true on a gold record on a piece of wood. It's in my den where I can look at it every day. I wear it out lookin' at it.
That rockabilly sound wasn't as simple as I thought it was.
If it helped you get your music off the ground, I'm glad you done it.
