American,Musician
When I was a little boy, there was no sound in the movies.
When you conduct opera, you control the stage. But with a film, the film controls you.
To me, there is nothing like the excitement and unique experience of a live orchestra playing.
That's part of show business: the moving.
My main object is to write, to keep learning. I always try to perfect my composition. But I do like writing film and opera music. I believe that it fulfills the needs of particular situations.
I have written symphonic poems and chamber music. It is my way of personal expression.
