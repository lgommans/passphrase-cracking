American,Musician
You know, it's just tough to get together and do work with somebody.
I love to sing. It's the easiest thing for me to do.
I think the whole reason for my life is in there somewhere.
When I was in my twenties, it felt like I was riding wild horses, and I was hoping I didn't go over a cliff.
Walking through this life really is walking through fire.
I'd been in a vicious cycle and circle of people and couldn't see my way out. So I picked myself up one day about 15 years ago and moved where I didn't know anyone.
If I love a song, I make it mine.
Getting a degree, being on Sesame Street... those were like real accomplishments to me.
I've always struggled so much just to appreciate myself.
But really, we also need to learn how to love one another as women. How to appreciate and respect each other.
My philosophy is familiarity breeds contempt.
There are a lot of people I would have liked to have collaborated with, and would still like to.
I'd like to work on putting art programs back in schools.
Being a singer is a way for me to get to a platform to do more.
I mean, I'm not unhappy, but there's still so much I want to do.
Well. I'm probably not loving myself like I should, but I'm really trying.
In my thirties, I felt I had hold of one of the reins some of the time.
I like to work spontaneously.
Everyone in my family sang, and we would always sing these songs.
I remember seeing the movie 'To Sir With Love' when I was a little girl.
One of the album's songs features Mary J. Blige, but I don't want to talk too much about it yet. I think you will hear the music that's been playing in my head when it comes out.
To me, this degree was an acknowledgment of my work in music.
