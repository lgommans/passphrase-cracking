British,Musician
My dad's my best mate, and he always will be.
In school, I was the quietest girl ever! I had a lot of trouble in school. Kids were mean to me.
I believe someone should be able to dress according to the mood they're in. It shouldn't be forced and you shouldn't have to follow a trend.
I don't feel like I have to be the nice girl.
I try and make all my songs sound different from each other while doing it in a way that's still me. It's a tricky thing to do.
I'll always stand by my Gypsy roots, and I'll always help out one of my own.
I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me because of the fact I haven't got any true friends! I'm fine the way I am.
This whole 'X Factor' thing with people assuming I'm going to be a one-hit wonder - that won't happen with me.
I don't care about the charts; I just want to make great music that I enjoy performing on stage and I'm proud of.
When you sing live, you cannot expect any artist, except for the amazing Beyonce or GaGa, to get it right every time.
