American,Musician
I want to write my own music, and I want to tour.
There's nothing about the stage to be afraid of; there's nothing about the cameras to be afraid of. You just have to be yourself.
You can't help but be in a good mood around Blake Shelton. I felt like I always knew him even though I was just meeting him; it was like he had been a part of my life forever.
