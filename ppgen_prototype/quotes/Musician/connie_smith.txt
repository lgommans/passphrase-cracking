American,Musician
Kids flourish if we get them to school every day.
I hear so many of the young people today sing and I think they have a good voice, yet I wonder if they'll ever know that they sound alike.
I love the music business very much.
Inspiration is finding something that excites you.
When a song comes to you, you can't run around it.
I have such a deep love for traditional country music.
