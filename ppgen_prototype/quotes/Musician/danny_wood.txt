American,Musician
I wake up every morning feeling like I have the best life.
Everything goes in cycles in the music industry.
I've definitely made sure to surround myself with friends who are going to protect me.
The Beatles were perfect. There's just no other way to say it. They were the perfect band.
I think I have almost everything I could ever want. I have my family, and I have a lot of love in my life.
Growing up in Boston and dancing in the streets, you see a lot of things.
