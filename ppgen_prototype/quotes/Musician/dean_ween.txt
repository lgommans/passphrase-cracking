I would read fishing reports on the road and then it just occurred to me: I should go to sea school and get my captain's license, see if I can get paid to be out here every day.
If you can find one thing in your life that can keep you in the moment, you're totally lucky.
The juxtaposition between fishing and touring couldn't be greater.
When you make a great record, it's around forever.
When you first start doing it, being on tour is inspiring, because you've never been anywhere.
We don't know what we're doing. We don't have a plan. We don't sit down and calculate it.
I want to make 20, 30, 50 studio records.
It's quantity, not quality.
If you write 50 songs, you're bound to write at least a dozen good ones.
I get sick when I think about someone going to iTunes and downloading two songs off our album. It's not meant to be listened to that way.
On tour, I'll get up at 5 p.m. and go to bed at 8 in the morning. With fishing, it's the exact opposite. Fishing is the only healthy thing I do. Touring is such a grind; it's the opposite of healthy.
