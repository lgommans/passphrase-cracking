VH1 does its little '80s retro thing once in a while, all of us in our bad hairdos and unfortunate clothes.
We've mellowed out, man.
It's so amazing, standing on the corner -this happened in Washington, D.C. - and somebody comes by in a Cadillac and you hear 'Manic Monday' on the radio, and you don't even know this person, and they're listening to it and singing along with it. Wow! Blows your mind.
We had an EP out and all of a sudden we find record companies are interested in us, and we're thinking, 'Oh, that's really nice, but we don't think we're ready for it.'
We had this budding baby band going and we hadn't reached that development we wanted to reach before we got signed to a major label.
