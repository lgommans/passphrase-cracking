The thing I wonder about is where does Brian's creative spark come from? Not his subjects or anything, but his spark. What makes it so great for me is that I really don't know. There's a mystery behind Brian, even to me.
There will always be a Beach Boys. Being a Beach Boy is like being in love.
They say I live a fast life. Maybe I just like a fast life. I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world. It won't last forever, either. But the memories will.
I can tell you the day The Beach Boys will no longer exist - never. We'll be on stage in wheelchairs.
My dad was a tyrant. He used to physically beat the crap out of us.
He just had a very unique way of expressing himself physically with his kids.
The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.
Brian was the oldest, I was in the middle and Carl was the baby. I was the troublemaker. Brian got great grades and Carl got the kind of grades I did. I failed everything. I was too busy fighting and running wild.
My mom had to beg the guys to let me play. I couldn't even play the drums right - Brian had to show me.
I made a dollar a day sweeping a laundry out. Then we made a record that was number two in Los Angeles. We got so excited hearing it on the radio that Carl threw up.
The Beach Boys are not a superstar group. The music is the superstar of the group.
All I need is a big surfboard and a piano.
