Overall I think that the most important thing is to have true friends, and always to stay true to yourself and never try to be somebody that you're not.
I always try to be a reliable friend.
When you're with girl you want to be with, everything's perfect.
I'm a very romantic and passionate guy.
Before every performance I feel nervous.
