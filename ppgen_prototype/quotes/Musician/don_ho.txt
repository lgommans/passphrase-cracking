I kiss grandmas because they're clean. I haven't picked anything up from a grandma yet.
I had no intention of being an entertainer.
You never know what's going to happen next onstage.
My wife knows that I thrive on independence, and whatever girls live with me must know that, too. They must realize I have a certain respect for my wife and love for my children, and my work comes pretty much ahead of all that.
I think the word for me is survival, not ambition. I'm really a lucky man. I've always accepted whatever I was in, whether it was driving a taxi or entertaining. The jet set might not enjoy what I do, but I deal with the average person.
