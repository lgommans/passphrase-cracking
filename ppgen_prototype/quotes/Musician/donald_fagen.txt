American,Musician
When you get a groove going, time flies.
Anthemic rock music is inherently fascist - anything intended to move huge masses of people is politically offensive to me.
Popularity has everything to do with business and nothing to do with music.
I have a critical nature, in the sense that when I look at something I often look for the flaws.
What do you do with what you're given, and how do you transform it into something worthwhile?
We're not getting any younger.
People are usually afraid to say what's on their mind.
I like it when songs develop in some way. Four minutes usually isn't enough time for something to develop musically.
I had trouble distinguishing art from life. I don't now, and I feel much better!
Randy Newman seemed like an even worse singer than me. I liked Ray Charles, Levi Stubbs, Jack Jones, Joe Tex, Wilson Pickett.
I took some lessons as a kid but trained myself by ear. I did it the way jazz musicians used to learn years ago, which is to play records and slow them down to figure out the notes. At first I tried to imitate Red Garland, who was my favorite jazz pianist.
My style is a little quirky. I can't play as fast as most professional jazz players.
My writing is really intuitive. As a kid, I went to school in New Jersey and hung out in New York, so the way kids used to talk got into our earlier songs.
I've never been comfortable as a lead performer, and I never wanted to be a singer, particularly.
