American,Musician
I go out with my band six months of the year and the rest of them with the Blues Brothers.
I never thought I'd get a chance to sing with Wilson Pickett but we did.
I was just about 6 weeks old when we moved to Detroit.
The groups, though, were my inspiration way back then. I liked Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers.
Oh yeah, I know Johnnie Bassett. We were part of that whole thing.
People know me for up-tempo songs because of my hits.
Everybody had their fans and they were fans of all of them.
