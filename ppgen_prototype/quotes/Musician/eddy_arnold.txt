Touring is really a pretty lonely business.
This is my seventh decade... and every once in a while I get a hankering to re-visit these songs again... songs with which I have had a great relationship.
When I finally put my guitar in the case the last time, I want to be remembered just as a singer, not as a country singer or pops singer - just a singer.
Don't be afraid to fall flat on your face.
I'm trying to sell every audience something; that something is me.
