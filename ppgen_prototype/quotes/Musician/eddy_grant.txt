There has never been any proper commitment to marketing these artists and their music. We are not Sony.
The artists realise it will take time. It is an upliftment process.
I am outraged that the Gorillaz have infringed the copyright of my song 'Time Warp,' claiming their song 'Stylo' to be an original composition.
