Singing is a way of escaping. It's another world. I'm no longer on earth.
Don't care what people say. Don't give a damn about their laws.
I think you have to pay for love with bitter tears.
Death is the beginning of something.
I want to make people cry even when they don't understand my words.
I'd like to see one person - just one - who would own up to having been a coward.
I've always wanted to sing, just as I've always known that one day I would have my own niche in the annals of song. It was a feeling I had.
Tell me what you'd like to hear me sing. I'll sing whatever you like, after which I'll take up a collection, if you don't mind.
As far as I'm concerned, love means fighting, big fat lies, and a couple of slaps across the face.
All I've done all my life is disobey.
To be successful in my native France, where people speak the same language and understand me, is nothing.
Death does not exist.
I don't want to die an old lady.
I wouldn't mind at all coming back to earth after my death.
I've been thinking about Jesus. Don't you find it a bit strange that, since He was living with His family and all, He up and left them just when they needed him most?
If God has allowed me to earn so much money, it is because He knows I give it all away.
Money? How did I lose it? I never did lose it. I just never knew where it went.
People say that I could sing the phone book and make it sound good.
To sing is to bring to life; impossible if the words are mediocre, however good the music.
