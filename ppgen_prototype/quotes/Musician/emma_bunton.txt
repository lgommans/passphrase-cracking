I don't think I will ever get tired of wearing pink.
Be yourself, take control of your life.
I've got a Range Rover and a little Mercedes. I normally drive my Range Rover because I feel like a monster in it. Nobody messes with me.
I'm not a big sports fan, but I love it when they 'slam dunk.' That's sexy.
I think the way to keep a friendship is to respect that everybody is different.
Be sweet, be good, and honest always.
I'm not a pop star.
I love shopping, especially food shopping.
I do have panic attacks every time I go on stage so I'm really not sure why I put myself through this.
Be sweet and honest always, but for God's sake don't eat my doughnuts!
We're all doing different things and some of the girls are mums, so priorities have changed. But I would love to do something with the Spice Girls again. I know we would have an amazing time.
My family brought me up to be very respectful of people.
I do believe in fate.
I've become saucy.
I love watching reality shows - I'm up to date with 'America's Next Top Model' and I love 'Project Runway.' But the shows where they're just sitting in a house aren't as fun to me!
Please ignore rumors! I've had them for years and you have to just let them go over your head. Don't take them personally.
I think people recognize me if I am going out to dinner or if I am staying in a hotel. They are not quite sure at first because I have grown up a lot.
Just being at home, growing up naturally, and being here now with my video and my music, I think people realize that I was in the Spice Girls 8 years ago.
I am a huge fan of Gwen Stefani.
I do love a man who can cook.
