American,Musician
I've always known, before I had a record deal, that the thing is to go out and put on the show. I've been doing that from day one.
I write all the time, even if it means recording in the hotel room. I write on the plane, anywhere, anytime I'm inspired or have ideas.
I definitely want my fans to know that I'm here to stay, and I'm going to continue to give them hot music.
I'm not the only one in the studio a lot of times, so I have my boys in there and they'll tell me and give me their suggestions and what they think.
I love my fans, so when I get the chance to interact with them, it's beautiful.
It's always overwhelming when you come to another country and you're embraced in such a positive way.
I love the energy over here in the U.K., the hospitality is insane.
I'm a huge fan of Taio Cruz. I'm really liking what he's doing at the moment. I'd love to do something with him.
The fans are always at the hotel waiting, they like to get pictures and autographs. I enjoy it all, the displays of love and support at the hotel and the shows.
Music was definitely a way out. Instead of playing basketball, I was going to recording studios.
If they can go out and buy my albums, I can at least make the sacrifice to holler at the few people who call. A lot of times I'm busy so they'll get my voice mail. And if I can speak to them and I have time, I always text back. Because I think that's very important.
At the end of the day I want to be the guy who experienced music in all type of ways, with hip-hop being the roots of it.
I like to take music from everywhere and put it in my style and let it be accepted.
I'm influenced by all types of music.
I wouldn't mind working with Outkast. I'm a big fan of them.
I went on tour with Beyonce before. I wouldn't mind doing something with her.
