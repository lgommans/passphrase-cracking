To find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads.
My purpose is far greater than my pain.
The Foxy character and Inga Marchand are two different people. My fiance calls me Inga. No one around me calls me Foxy. I go to church every Sunday. I go to Bible study every Friday night. I'm saved.
I'm a child of the Women's Movement. I always believed that I could do anything. That women didn't have to be limited in any way.
Put out great music, and that's that.
I am racing to the studio the moment that God affords me the opportunity to hear again.
It feels so good to tell the truth.
I'm cut from a different cloth. I would never moon someone. I was raised in a good family.
I did almost a year in prison, a year in prison, just because my name is Foxy Brown.
My family never missed a visit in eight months, ever. I cried coming out. I didn't cry coming in. There's a big difference. I believe that God put me there for a reason, Incarceration is serious.
I'm not at every party; I'm not seen everywhere. That's why people still care about my brand.
I've never stabbed, hurt, killed, stolen, anything, but I went to jail for a year. What is that? My pastor said to me the fact that I'm not living under a bridge as a crazy woman, talking to myself, is amazing.
I love Harlem, it's like a second home to me.
Being in jail, it's humbled me in a way I never imagined.
The only crime I'm guilty of is being a young black woman.
I devoted my career to building an affinity with my fans who have supported me unflinchingly and no barbed wire fence or prison wall will stop that.
I was falsely arrested twice, slandered and defamed.
I'm willing to do whatever I need to do to change.
My life needed to be saved. Not just Foxy. That's my character. That's my work. Inga is a person.
I came out even with all the struggles I endured on Rikers Island.
