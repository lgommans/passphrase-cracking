British,Musician
I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend.
I dress to kill, but tastefully.
When the whole point of Queen was to be original.
The reason we're successful, darling? My overall charisma, of course.
I'm hopeless with money; I simply spend what I've got.
I have fun with my clothes onstage; it's not a concert you're seeing, it's a fashion show.
I want to lead the Victorian life, surrounded by exquisite clutter.
What will I be doing in twenty years' time? I'll be dead, darling! Are you crazy?
When I'm dead, I want to be remembered as a musician of some worth and substance.
A concert is not a live rendition of our album. It's a theatrica! event.
Money may not buy happiness, but it can damn well give it!
It destroys the soul to hear that you're all hype, that you have no talent, and that your whole career has been contrived.
I like to be surrounded by splendid things.
The others don't like my interviews. And frankly, I don't care much for theirs.
I'm just a musical prostitute, my dear.
I think my melodies are superior to my lyrics.
I always knew I was a star And now, the rest of the world seems to agree with me.
I'm very emotional; I think I may go mad in several years' time.
We're a very expensive group; we break a lot of rules. It's unheard of to combine opera with a rock theme, my dear .
Who wants to live forever?
Onstage, I am a devil. But I'm hardly a social reject.
Years ago, I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name. But it's regal, obviously, and -sounds splendid.
If we're weird onstage, I don't know what you'd call the Tubes.
Back in the old days, we were often compared to Led Zeppelin. If we did something with harmony, it was the Beach Hoys. Something heavy was Led Zeppelin.
Is Billy Idol just doing a bad Elvis pout, or was he born that way?
We're a bit flashy, but the music's not one big noise.
