Swedish,Musician
Being rich and famous isn't all happiness and at times the pressures have got to me.
Money cannot buy happiness.
I must have some sort of record in failing to get into the charts.
The kind of music I like depends very much on my mood.
I like to think of myself as being fashion-conscious without being a slave to fashion.
