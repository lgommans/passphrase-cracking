I would have been content to just do studio work, making it on my own never really entered my mind.
I like to start the day early, it keeps me out of trouble.
I guess I'm like Roger Miller who used to say that he didn't have as many jokes as he thought he did.
Some people have said that I can 'hear' a hit song, meaning that I can tell the first time a song is played for me if it has potential. I have been able to hear some of the hits that way, but I can also 'feel' one.
