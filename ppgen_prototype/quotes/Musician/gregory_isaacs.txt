Jamaican,Musician
Look at me as a man who performed works musically. Who uplift people who need upliftment, mentally, physically, economically - all forms. Who told the people to live with love 'cause only love can conquer war, and to understand themselves so that they can understand others.
Since I was growing up, I liked love songs - Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke. That was the kind of songs getting the girls dancing.
If I produce myself, I'm gonna exploit no one - just myself.
Bob Marley was one of my favourite artists. He sang politically conscious lyrics, yet he sang love songs, too.
When people hear the name Gregory Isaacs, I want dem to think of 'Night Nurse' and 'Red Rose For Gregory' and 'The Cool Ruler.' I love it when somebody comes up to me and say, 'I love your songs.'
The Gregory Isaacs feel is universal, trying to uplift who I can uplift. I sing music on a worldwide basis. That is made to be accepted in thy sight.
