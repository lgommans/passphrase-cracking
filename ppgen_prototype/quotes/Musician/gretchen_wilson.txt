I don't really think about having had a hard life. It was just my life, and it's all I knew. It made me who I am - all the good and bad - and it's where all of the songs on Here For The Party came from. I've lived them all.
What I'm doing is a dream come true but at the same time its work. It's like anything else. The only time it doesn't really feel like work to me is when I'm on stage and doing what I've prepared myself for my whole life which is to stand out in front of a crowd and sing.
I got to where I couldn't listen to country radio. Country music is supposed to have steel and fiddle. When I hear country music, it should be country.
People ask me where I go to get away, and I say 'Home.'
I just like Raisin Bran - it keeps me regular.
All my life, I just felt that I should have finished my education.
I don't want to be ignorant in my daughter's eyes.
I still fit in with the hillbillies!
I've always been the kind of woman who had a man in her life even when he was the wrong man.
To me, redneck is a sense of self and a way of life.
My daughter is a redneck woman, she's a redneck girl.
Mothers and daughters have that rivalry thing.
I'm a mom first, a singer second.
Good music is good music.
Today, if you were to look at my CD collection, it might scare some people.
I think music can heal your soul if you'll let it. It can also bring you up if you're down. It can also bring you down if you're too up. It's a mood thing.
