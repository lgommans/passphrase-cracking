It is what it is, it is what you make it.
I have Tourettes and Aspergers, but Tourrets and Aspergers don't have me. You know, I'm doing what I can to suppress it and I don't let it take advantage of me. It's not who I am. You know, I'm James Durbin. Like I said in the beginning, I am here to show America who I am, and it is what it is.
As soon as I got up on that stage, and I remembered how welcoming and warming the judges, their presence is, and it was just all uphill from there.
I appreciate what others have done in the past especially for my genre, and my style of singing. And they sure put a footprint - you know, they got the foot in the door, but I'm going to put my foot straight through the door.
The first think I did when I found out I was a finalist, was, I don't remember, because it felt like it was an out of body experience.
My favorite type of music to sing and to listen to, you know, rock. It's not always metal, but you know, half the time it is. Metal's cool, you know? Not everybody on 'American Idol' listens to metal.
The first time I heard The Beatles, I cried. It was 'Let it Be'.
If my life were a song it would be called 'Don't Stop Believing'. Yeah.
Give metal a chance!
