American,Musician
I really want to put the emphasis on creating music. I want to cut a record. I want to start going on tour.
I want to learn - there's so much I have to learn about what it takes to be a recording artist, about what it takes to go on tour.
I just can't wait to continue creating music.
I want to do musician things and start making this my life. I want to learn - there's so much I have to learn about what it takes to be a recording artist, about what it takes to go on tour. I want to take this time and be a sponge and start meeting people and start - just start.
I really look forward to putting on a record. I love writing music and think that may be my strong suit even more than singing. I can't wait to take that music on tour and share it with as many people as I can.
I feel like I've grown and become a more consummate performer. I feel like I've chiseled out a more distinctive niche.
Personally, I think I am much calmer under incredibly stressful situations, and I've learned to deal with pressure and nerves, which is key to being a performer of any caliber.
