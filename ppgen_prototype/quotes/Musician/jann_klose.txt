South Africa is a whole other world. I went to grade school there and high school in Johannesburg, and before that, my family lived in Kenya in Nairobi where my brother was actually born, and my sister was born in Capetown. I spent the first 10 years of my life in South Africa.
David Bendeth was introduced to me by an entertainment lawyer friend.
Writing songs is really about writing. It's not about necessarily focusing on one particular style or making it one particular thing.
When you look at anyone's iPod or iPhone and their music collection on there, it's not the same 10 songs. People like diversity.
I listen to a lot of different styles of music. So it doesn't have to be just one thing. I prefer it. If it's not, I get bored very easily.
I want to do something that is unique, that has its own legs. But it's very hard because if you start veering off, if you get too crazy, then people won't know what to make of it. I want to please my audience, too. I want people to like what I do.
I grew up in Africa surrounded by a lot of culture. It's made me aware that the world is a big place.
It's a different thing playing in a smaller venue where you can actually see people's faces and reactions. It's so much more intimate. You walk away with a more personal experience.
