I think the biggest challenge is to continue on the same path. I think it's easy to become complacent from the success you've had.
I want somebody like my mom. My mom is a very charitable woman. She's the sweetest woman in the world. I'm looking for the second sweetest woman in the world. I'm looking for honesty and a big heart.
If you think you've already made it, that's when you can fall short and go backwards. I'm constantly pushing forward and chasing the element of perfection.
I've been traveling the world and experiencing different places, and you always discover new things.
It's amazing when you're playing to a crowd who barely understands English but they're singing parts of your song back to you.
My outlook on life is so much clearer.
To all my fans who planned to come to the Future History World tour, the pain of letting you down cuts me way deeper than this injury I've sustained.
I've learned how much of an impact that music has on people. I get messages all the time from people telling me what my music means to them and what it has done to them.
I think that by going on the path that I am, my destiny will just come to me.
I don't think I can ever escape from music.
I don't watch much TV at all.
I would love to start a cancer organization.
I know that all things are possible through Jesus Christ.
I just really want to continue on the same intensity of work ethic, I don't want to slow now. I'm 21-year's old and I feel like this era and a few years to come are my prime years, so I want to utilise them.
