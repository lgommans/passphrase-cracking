When I came out rapping on my record, a lot of people said, Oh, you just want to be like Puff.
We're just welcoming people to our city.
We haven't had a slew of artists, but the artists we do come out with have always had the same momentum.
They keep the song as street as it needs to be. It's got a good catchy hook where it can do what it needs to do on the radio, but they keep the song street where it will keep credibility in the hood.
So So Def has been one of the most successful and consistent labels in the game in the last 10 years.
People know me, and want to know me, as a baller more than anything else.
People always ask me how long somebody can last as long as I've been lasting and continue to keep doing it, so I figured that people didn't really know how to do that.
My father was a promoter of Fresh Fest, and they needed an opening act. He got me a slot as a dancer. We tried it out the first time in Atlanta and the crowd went crazy. I was the opening clown.
If you don't know by now, you're never going to know.
I'm one of those guys a lot of people watch, imitate, and then make it seem like they were the ones who did it first.
I'd go dance at talent shows, and because I was young I had the upper hand on a lot of other crews. People thought it was cute. I used that to my advantage.
I wanted to feel like an artist for once in my life. I wanted to use other producers for respect, to let them know that I listen to other people's music and that I'm just not out here on my own page.
I go to clubs and if I notice the DJs are playing the records faster, then I'll push the beats a little on the next record I make. A lot of people don't know how to watch out for things like that.
Because I was in Atlanta, people didn't realize I'm one of the real forefathers in the game.
All the records I've made have pretty much been big club turntable records. You need to feel the rhythm.
