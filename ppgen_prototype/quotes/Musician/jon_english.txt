Australian,Musician
You can lay down and die, or you can get up and fight, but that's it - there's no turning back.
I have crushed the cup of youth like a rose between my fingers but its nectar never warmed my weary heart.
Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away and every ounce of energy you try to give away as the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play.
I was born in March 1949, a post war baby boomer.
I was lucky enough to see the Beatles play live.
