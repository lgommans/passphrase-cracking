I love the spirit of Halloween and the energy that comes with it.
I think we all depend on a significant other, and we think if they leave me, I'll die. But that's not true. We're all much stronger than we think we are.
To be honest, I'm really more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of a girl.
I don't really dress up for Halloween.
Everyone has that inner voice, the one that's a Negative Nancy. I'd say to ignore that voice and to be confident and follow your heart.
The thing is, work is the thing I love the most.
I am just the person who didn't want to settle for not having everything I dreamed of.
America is a country with so much opportunity. I'm living the blessings of what this country offers.
I have always loved the Summer Olympics.
I was a competitive swimmer in middle school and high school.
Even if I weren't in Hollywood, I would feel pressure to look a certain way.
I don't have to be a 'gazillionaire;' what's important to me is to just being able to work.
If you deprive yourself of something, you're going to want it more.
I'm not a perfect human being.
I grew up in dance class, so I was looking in mirrors all day.
I have an amazing relationship with food.
I love my body when I'm in the best shape I can be in.
It feels good to be strong.
I can understand why guys wouldn't be into 'Glee.' You know, that's a pretty heavy musical show. That show does, like, six songs in an episode.
No, I'm not a scientologist.
I'm a horrible drawer. I have no artistic ability in my hands.
I still have to count on my hands! I'll be in a restaurant doing a tip and I'll be like, 'What's 20% of this?'
I'm so unprofessional on set it's not even funny.
I enjoy going to church.
I love entertaining.
The reason I haven't had kids yet is because I was so focused on my acting career, hoping I could get something to break.
