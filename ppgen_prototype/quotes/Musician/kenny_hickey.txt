It wasn't so much of a controlled effort to end up as part of the Goth scene.
Yeah, I kinda still get nervous sometimes now.
We've always had a dark atmosphere to our performances, so it sort of developed along those ways.
We are all atheists.
I'm a recovering alcoholic so I should be home.
I think it's just a lack of ability, we're incapable of writing hits.
I look at is as one single entity. I dehumanize the audience. This way, I don't get nervous, you know?
I hate crowds of people pretending to be happy on one night of the year, where they get drunk and obnoxious by the end of the night.
Everything is a battle with this band.
Aww, come on man, I can barely handle 6 strings.
Also there's two sides of it, I mean, a band like us, at our level and the way we have to promote ourselves and usually radio just completely turns their back on us, at the same time I think Mp3s help promote us somewhat, spreading the word about the album and stuff.
