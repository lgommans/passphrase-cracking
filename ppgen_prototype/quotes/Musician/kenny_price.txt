Businessmen and corporate men watch 'Hee Haw.' With that kind of audience, how can they take it off?
All I thought about when I was a kid was getting my guitar and entertaining people.
'Hee Haw' began about the same time as 'Laugh-In,' but the difference was that the material on 'Laugh-In' was more sophisticated: people looked out windows. On 'Hee Haw,' they look out of cornfields.
