Acting? No, it is not for me. I would be terrible.
I love to write, to sing, to make music. Not to act: I am horrible.
The European public has always been great to me.
I was gonna write songs, I was gonna be a star and a singer and I never thought of doing anything else.
I write from what's in my heart. I write what I love and have always done that.
Nashville has a great creative atmosphere. It's a small, close-knit music community that you can't find anywhere else.
