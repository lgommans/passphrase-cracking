American,Musician
I take all of my life lessons, which some people might call 'mistakes,' and apply them to my future so that I keep growing.
It's totally weird to see myself on a billboard!
I wear a lot of black, but not in the goth way, I just really love black. I'll never be in pink or purples.
I don't do earrings.
I like things in my hair - big feather pieces.
I juggle a lot of different balls and sometimes I don't know how I manage to keep them all up in the air, but I do!
Well, I love tattoos and have been drawing them on my binders in school since I was little.
Sometimes I'll flip through a magazine and do a double take when I see myself in it, it's just crazy!
I'm a huge shoe person, and I have lots of shoes.
I started singing at age five and haven't stopped since.
I love every kind of music.
The people that go on 'American Idol' do want some recognition and fame.
I never thought I would become a television host, but I never thought anybody would pay me to just talk.
