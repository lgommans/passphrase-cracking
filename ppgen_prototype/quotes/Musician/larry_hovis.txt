Any competent actor could have done what I did.
At some point, you've got to realize, you're either a leading man or you're not.
I didn't equate a POW camp with a concentration camp.
I had to be sure we were doing something tasteful.
I was probably never going to get to do the kind of things dramatically that I really wanted to do, so I returned to theater from time to time, and to write, and produce. It's by no means sour grapes.
