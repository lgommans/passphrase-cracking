American,Musician
I want to touch people's hearts, to get right down to their souls.
When you're on stage, the audience becomes your other half. It's the ultimate high you can reach as a musician - an incredible feeling. And no matter where I am it's still the same; there's a reason we call music the universal language.
I want to move people the way Edith Piaf did.
I want a place where I can have horses.
