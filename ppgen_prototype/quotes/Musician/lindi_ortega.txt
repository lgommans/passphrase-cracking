Canadian,Musician
My dad was a bass player in a Latino band when I was growing up. So we always had musical instruments in our basement.
I'm a fan of retracing the facts and absorbing my atmosphere and being influenced by it.
The reason I moved to Nashville was because I was reading biographies of a lot of my country music heroes, and I thought it would be better to actually go where the history was, as opposed to just reading about it.
I like passion in voices. I like passion in music. And I find that, sometimes with today's music, it's just so perfect - it's that high fidelity and all of the auto-tuning and all that stuff. It's too perfect for my ears.
I'm not ashamed to admit that I've written some really bad songs and I've had some bad performances.
Certain social situations make me feel like a square peg in a round hole. Realising you can connect to the human race through song makes me feel less alien.
I love singing.
It's always my goal to raise the bar with each record I put out.
I like to work with different musicians and producers to change the feels of every release.
I have this drive to prove people wrong - people who thought I should give up or assumed I'd never get anywhere.
