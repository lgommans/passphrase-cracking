American,Musician
You know, I'm an eagle, flying around in the mountains.
Because I'm not the same today as I was in '58, or '59 or even '71.
I'm surprised that I actually pulled off the recording, getting all those people at the same time.
But I don't believe in organised politics, organised religion, organised music, organised anything.
Elvis was rock'n'roll. He came from the poverty and the pain.
God is playing my guitar, I am with God when I play.
I just believe in my Indian, spiritual god and my music.
If you went to see me today, you might not like my music.
Money don't rule me, record companies don't rule me.
Soul music is pain - you can hear the slaves, the beatin' and the hurtin'.
