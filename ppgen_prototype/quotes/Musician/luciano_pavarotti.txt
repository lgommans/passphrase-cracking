Italian,Musician
The rivalry is with ourself. I try to be better than is possible. I fight against myself, not against the other.
Above all, I am an opera singer. This is how people will remember me.
I'm a perfectionist, and I always think that I can do better what I have done, even if it's good.
If you see me once, you cannot confuse me with another.
Am I afraid of high notes? Of course I am afraid. What sane man is not?
For me, music making is the most joyful activity possible, the most perfect expression of any emotion.
It is so important for people at a young age to be invited to embrace classical music and opera.
Opera is one of the most important art forms. It should be listened to and appreciated by everyone.
If children are not introduced to music at an early age, I believe something fundamental is actually being taken from them.
I was an elementary school teacher.
Sometime to be called Pavarotti is not always an advantage.
Learning music by reading about it is like making love by mail.
You don't need any brains to listen to music.
I want to be famous everywhere.
I am a tenor buff. I hear myself.
I am a very superstitious person.
I am open to everything.
I want to reach as many people as possible with the message of music, of wonderful opera.
It is a very honest world, our work. I think you cannot fake anything.
Opera is a beautiful and important diversion for me.
People have a right to criticize.
The better voice doesn't mean being a better singer.
The music itself could never take the place of my own passion in life.
There is no prodigy in our profession. If you see all the great singer of the past, none of them are.
Why should be elite, music? Excuse me. Music must be for everybody.
He wants only to rest and to have a little peace.
