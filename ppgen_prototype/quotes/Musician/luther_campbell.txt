Words are just words.
Tampa's crazy... The ladies in Tampa come in all flavors. I felt like I was at Dairy Queen.
People expect me to be with some stripper... That's just the kind of woman I work with.
If it wasn't for 2 Live Crew videos wouldn't look like they do and rappers wouldn't sound like they do.
I'm gonna perform on one of the nights. Good clean fun; we're not going to jail. For the record.
I want to do a record with Monica Lewinsky.
I have done so much for hip-hop and 'til this day, I haven't received any awards or any recognition for it.
I am tired of being in an industry that doesn't appreciate me.
I am going into the adult market because they don't care what label you are signed to or who you know.
I also want to announce that I'm changing my name. I haven't told anyone. You get the scoop.
Goodness and hard work are rewarded with respect.
