American,Musician
I don't think it's by any means an end to my career.
I had to focus on some personal areas in my life with the little bit of privacy that I have.
In all honesty, I'm not able to talk about contracts. It's nothing with 'American Idol' in particular, it's just things I really need to take care of in my life.
It is a reality show... this show is never without drama.
You can't go wrong with love.
I'm excited and blessed.
I can dance, act, beatbox and whistle very well.
I'd like to know how to play the guitar.
An American Idol is someone that has all the qualities that America thinks is positive, attractive and alluring.
I love the sounds of Latin jazz, R&B, hip-hop, alternative, all that stuff. I'm a radio kid.
It's surreal to know my dreams are coming true.
Everything is falling into place.
It was an amazing experience to work with Michael Jackson, who is a legend.
I will always be singing.
