I wanted a name that would put us first in the phone directory, or second if you count ABBA.
I don't really like groups that make the same statement over and over again. It's good, but kind of predictable.
Sinatra was pretty astute - he used the best songwriters around, he used all the resources, he covered every song from the era basically.
It's a pleasure playing your big hit records and it's a real joy to see the audience.
