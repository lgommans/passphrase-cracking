Somehow, people get very nervous about leaving the comfortable life of rules behind and never take the chance to develop their own internal voice, to listen to their own consciousness.
I was working as a stockbroker in New York and had the seemingly perfect life.
People simply learn to process information to the point where it doesn't serve true creativity.
I'm definitely a romantic, no doubt about it.
I left an office at the top of the Pan Am Building, a nine-room apartment, and a farm in Vermont because I was aching inside. It took an analyst to tell me I could write a note of permission to become a musician and sign it.
I had been the dutiful son and husband for so long, I had forgotten about living for myself.
I come from a background that stresses education more than anything.
I was used to being successful in school, but academics didn't make me happy.
The thing I ran up against was everybody wanted a song so fast. It took me two years to finish 'Touch Me in the Morning.'
I would spend months and months looking for a sound. I had to do that, or I wouldn't feel the extreme emotions I was feeling in my heart.
When you write a song, you don't ask if it's good or not, or if it's gonna sell. When you write a song, you ask whether you've reached deep inside your heart and whether it's honest.
When you're writing a song, you have to know two things. You have to know who you are, and you have to think about other people.
