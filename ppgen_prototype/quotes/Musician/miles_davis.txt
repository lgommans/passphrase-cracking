American,Musician
I'm always thinking about creating. My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something creative to do with my life.
A legend is an old man with a cane known for what he used to do. I'm still doing it.
Do not fear mistakes. There are none.
Don't play what's there, play what's not there.
I know what I've done for music, but don't call me a legend. Just call me Miles Davis.
I'll play it and tell you what it is later.
The thing to judge in any jazz artist is, does the man project and does he have ideas.
Sometimes you have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself.
For me, music and life are all about style.
It's always been a gift with me, hearing music the way I do. I don't know where it comes from, it's just there and I don't question it.
You can dominate a game if you dominate on the line... We're just going to have to go out there and work hard and blow people off the ball, and let our runners do what they do best.
I'll play it first and tell you what it is later.
If you understood everything I say, you'd be me!
