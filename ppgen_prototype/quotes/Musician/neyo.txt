When you're dressing on a budget, simplicity is key.
My style is mainly about comfort. It has to be comfortable, it has to lay right on me, know what I mean?
I probably wouldn't be singing if not for Michael Jackson. When I started singing, I didn't like my tone until my mom put me on to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, so listening to the way they used their instrument helped me get more comfortable with my own.
I feel like everything is inspired by something else. There is no 100 percent original thought.
I sing because I love singing. I perform because I love performing. I write because I actually enjoy writing.
For the first few years of my life my mom used to cut my hair so there were a lot of bowl-cut hair styles.
My mom was the picture of the blue-collar mom: Two and three and four jobs to make sure that me and my sister never needed, that was her thing.
Michael Jackson believed in making music that made people feel good.
Every song I've ever written has been based in reality, based in fact, things that happen to me.
Prince is the ultimate performer. Prince is that dude that's going to get on stage by himself, if he need to, but hold you in the palm of his hand. Like, you can't take your eyes off the man when he's on stage, and he could just be sitting there playing his guitar.
I pride myself on being the type of artist who can work half in the R&B world and half in the pop world.
I have my diehard R&B fans on one side of the spectrum and my diehard pop and dance fans on the other side of the spectrum.
Hats have been my thing pretty much my whole life but finance has not. I would go to the corner store and buy really cheap baseball style caps and wear those to school.
For my prom, I wore a white suit with a burgundy shirt, tie and cummerbund, along with white shoes, a white trilby and a cane. I was extra fly that day.
