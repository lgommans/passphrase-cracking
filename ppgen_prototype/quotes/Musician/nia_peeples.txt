Life is a moving, breathing thing. We have to be willing to constantly evolve. Perfection is constant transformation.
You have to love yourself. That's the single most powerful thing. Out of that springs: How are you eating? How are you exercising? How are you resting?
Health and beauty is not just about what you apply. If you don't have it together on the inside, then nothing else is going to matter.
I've had a relationship, a good relationship, with MTV for a long time, and I'd like to maintain that.
When I was younger, before I was married and had children, I really was nit-picky, a perfectionist. I was very much into different people's approval. I had too much time on my hands, I think.
I knew that I always wanted a family, but I can honestly say that it's nothing like I imagined it would be.
I have a friend who does everything, travels all over the world, goes everywhere, and he says that no matter where in the world he's been, it never gets any better than having a child.
With women, the way they look... it's the core of their self-esteem.
