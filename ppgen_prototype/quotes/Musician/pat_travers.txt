Canadian,Musician
I had a lousy marriage and I drank too much.
I needed an opportunity to get back in the studio and get my recording chops back together.
I'm just gonna be doing stuff that I really enjoy doing. I'm not gonna attempt to be current in any way other than the fact that people will like what I'm doing currently.
We got a little waylaid along the way. The whole problem started about 10 years ago with management and legal battles, then still trying to make albums while I was doing all of that.
