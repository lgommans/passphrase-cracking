French,Musician
Sometimes, I wake up and the skies are grey and everything's horrible.
People tried to make me something that I wasn't at the beginning of my career.
When you lose your mother at 20 and then your father soon after, melancholia is part of your life.
I always doubted myself. I doubted the way I looked, my body, my voice - everything.
I am not sad, but I am melancholic. When you lose your mother at 20 and then your father soon after, melancholia is part of your life.
When you are 25 or even 30, you can just do things. When you get to 35, things are different. Time is more precious to me now. I've got my priorities.
