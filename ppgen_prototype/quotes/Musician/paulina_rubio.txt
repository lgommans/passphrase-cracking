Mexican,Musician
Everyone has a Latino inside them.
My music, my songs are 100 percent inspired by girl power.
I started in a band called 'Timbiriche', we toured the world when I was 8; I have 23 albums.
I was born in Mexico, I am from Mexico City.
With 'Timbiriche', I toured Brazil and a lot of Latin America.
There are a lot of influences from different countries in my music. For example, I chose the guitar in my music, I think that it is a feminine instrument, so when I do not sing, the music expresses my voice.
I like to be glamorous so I love the clothing and the big entrances. It needs to be spectacular!
