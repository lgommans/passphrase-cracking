Jamaican,Musician
I am not a politician... I only suffer the consequences.
I've got to pick myself up Dust myself off And start all over again.
In the beginning there was the word. The word was Jah. The word is in I, Jah is in I. I make what is good, better, and what is better, best. I follow this in every aspect of life.
To have the truth in your possession you can be found guilty, sentenced to death.
I mean the flesh, never fade! The flesh never leave the creation, see, because with that divine spirit the flesh cannot fade. If the spirit is weak then the flesh fade, seen?
And I ask why am I black, they say I was born in sin, and shamed inequity. One of the main songs we used to sing in church makes me sick, 'love wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
I travel the garden of music, thru inspiration. It's a large, very large garden, seen?
I don't think the label cares about an album... People just want their number-one record.
