British,Musician
In some ways, I've always approached singing as acting, and the voice is just like a way of carrying the song.
There are definitely people who are stuck in the '60s and there are definitely people who think I am and it's just not true. I was performing for a long time before the '60s and I'll be doing exciting interesting things for along time to come.
