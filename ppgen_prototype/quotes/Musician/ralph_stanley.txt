American,Musician
The soundtrack of O Brother is the most publicity I've gotten. I don't feel that I have lost any of my old fans, but I have gained new ones.
I believe in my music.
I've done it all. I'm thankful and proud of what I've accomplished in my life. I hope to keep doing it.
I would have quit before I went rock-n-roll. I know one way, and that's natural, and when I can't make it, I'll come home and stay. I believe in my music.
I don't listen to the radio too much, but usually I listen to Stanley Brothers and Ralph Stanley more than I do anybody!
I'm thankful that I have lived long enough to become a legend, and I hope I deserve it.
