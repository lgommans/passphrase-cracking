American,Musician
I dare anyone to play like Charlie Watts.
I dig all kinds of competition.
I prefer recording drums in the analog format, but that does not mean I would only do it that way.
I'd just play 'til my hands fell off. My parents would yell at me to stop because they couldn't stand the noise any more! I was terrible! It must have been hard for them to listen to me as a beginning drummer.
Just like music, sports elevates us to new levels of achievment.
My best investment is my imagination, because it has never failed to bring me my greatest returns!
My favorite athlete of all time would have to be Jim Thorpe.
My other Main Man is Muhamed Ali, for the obvious reasons.
My parents really encouraged me.
The nurses were all angels in my eyes.
There are no rules to writing a song.
