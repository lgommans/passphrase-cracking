I think soul will always find its way into what I'm doing. It just comes from my root.
It's way easier to write for other people. Yourself isn't in it. When you write for yourself, you overthink, and you become paranoid. When you write for others, it isn't about you.
I have a lot of fun writing for artists, but I'm learning to apply that fun to myself.
If there's room to make a record every year, and it sounds nothing like the old one, I might do that. It's easy to get in and have fun. To me, if it feels right, that's all that needs to be done.
I love sending stuff to Usher because it always sounds better than me.
