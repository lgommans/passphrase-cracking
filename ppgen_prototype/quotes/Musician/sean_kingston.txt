I make sure I always surround myself with good, down to earth, fun, real people, who always keep me grounded.
God is great.
I love Beyonce.
I think country has the biggest melodies ever.
I don't think an artist should keep themselves categorized in a specific box.
I love song writing, so I'm always happy to write for other musicians.
It's easy to gain weight when you're in the studio.
My goal is just to get healthy as far as what my ideal weight has to be for my height.
