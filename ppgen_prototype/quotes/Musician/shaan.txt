The Taj, the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Cracao Basilica and Polish church are some monuments that hold a special place in my memory.
I am not a stickler for Indian food, but by the third day or so I start looking for something familiar to eat. I have travelled a lot, and I always try out local food.
Jal Mahal, Jaipur, holds a special place for me and it is especially beautiful by night. I enjoy our stay at the old havelis in the region.
My partners are Gourov Dasgupta and Roshan Balu. Together, we're 'Superbia'. I've already signed some film and non-film assignments.
Composers and lyricists are not responsible for storyline and casting. One can imagine actors shouldering this responsibility, since they charge for half the film. But producers never ask actors to share the losses. Instead, they train their guns on composers and lyricists.
A person who shakes a leg to 'Zor ka jhatka' at a disc doesn't care about its picturization in the film. He enjoys and downloads it because of the merit of the song.
Composers and lyricists are making songs that are approved by the producers and directors.
Unless the clients want, I don't like to have dancers for my shows. I prefer a rock show look and like performing with a live band.
