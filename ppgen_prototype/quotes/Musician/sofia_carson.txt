American,Musician
My family is everything. They love me unconditionally.
I always wanted to make a pop record. I'm a dancer myself, so I want to make something that people listen to and just want to dance to.
I always loved Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast'. I always thought I looked like her, so I dressed like her for every Halloween.
I took vocal lessons all through my childhood and still do. I was classically trained.
When I was 18, I moved to Los Angeles to attend UCLA.
