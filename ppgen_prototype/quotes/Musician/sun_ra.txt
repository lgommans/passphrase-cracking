Musician
And then when I went to Chicago, that's when I had these outer space experiences and went to the other planets.
A prophet is not without honor except in his own country among his own people.
It's such a tragedy that man endures in killing his brother and his own kind, putting him in jail and insane asylums, letting him lay out in the street.
People have set that up as a standard, not to recognize a prophet in his own country.
What I'm dealing with is so vast and great that it can't be called the truth. It's above the truth.
But recently I began to feel that maybe I wouldn't be able to do what I want to do and need to do with American musicians, who are imprisoned behind these bars; music's got these bars and measures you know.
Music is a language, you see, a universal language.
I'm playing dark history. It's beyond black. I'm dealing with the dark things of the cosmos.
I'm not a minister, I'm not a philosopher, I'm not a politician, I'm in another category.
I am a musician, but I'm another type of musician.
I use music as a medium to talk to people.
The world is in such a bad condition that if they don't find what you call a redeemer, every man, woman and child on this planet will be eliminated.
Today's symphonic music is sponsored by the upper structures of society.
Bach and Beethoven, all of them, they had to write something to please the upper structure, those with money and power.
Not too many people in America know about me, but all of Europe knows about me.
All these other nations seem to appreciate what I'm doing and they want me to play the furthest out things.
I see people as they really are from a pure point of view.
A world is in danger, this planet is in great danger!
