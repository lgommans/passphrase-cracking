Chennai is such a beautiful place to perform in. The city is lovely, and the people, even more so.
My current role model is Beyonce. She is such a strong woman. She can do everything. She has kept herself together and has balanced her life perfectly. She is a great singer, great dancer and a great looker and is now a good mother and wife.
One of my passions is photography. I always carry a camera in my bag whenever I travel. I always take pictures wherever I go, and some of them end up being really crazy ones.
We don't live in an ancient era. Today, collaboration doesn't mean two singers standing next to each other at the mic to sing together.
Music will never stop - it can never stop. I will continue to sing for my fans till the end of time.
When kids were busy playing at the age of 11, I was singing for the heroine of 'Shastra.'
I can never stand in one place on stage for more than a minute and am always singing, dancing and jumping.
My mom is my heart. She was a rock for me even though she was not around as much as dad.
I think I'm the only singer who doesn't have a temper. The only time I got angry was at a music studio when I was made to wait for three hours without being informed about the delay in the recording.
I love working out at the gym, especially weight training. Therefore, my personal de-stress mantra is exercising.
Instead of watching DVDs at home, I prefer going to the cinema to get the experience.
People often get very entangled in their work and life, so de-stressing is very important to keep generating fresh ideas and provide satisfaction with one's activities.
