When I was a barber, me being extreme was how I got popular: you name it, I was drawing it on someone's head.
It's all positive energy from me, man.
You have to invest in yourself and your surroundings.
When I was growing up, there were so many things I thought were stylish. Jabo jeans, V Bombers, Clarks, Vikings, Nugget watches, Lee pants with the patches, leather hats - which I still wear now. All hip-hop stuff, all South Bronx stuff.
There's no wrong way of doing art. It's an expression of the individual.
Set your business plan to win; raise the bar or you're not going to be prepared. You need to think that what you're doing will make you $100 million.
Music is the universal language.
My worst haircuts have been the ones where I've done my own.
I didn't go to prom - I DJ'd all my proms.
I started off as a graffiti artist in the South Bronx. My tag name was 'Loco' because I would go crazy and tag anywhere I wanted, in the weirdest places.
My art side is free and there are no strings attached.
I don't even know how to sell a piece of artwork of mine because it's so personal.
I'm the last person that wants to give away music for free.
I think K-Pop is a type of expression.
I want to help promote Korean music around the world.
My idea to bridge the world together with music starting in Asia and going to the West is something that is new, untapped and leading to the future of bringing the worlds together.
I think that a lot of people just don't understand creativity.
You know, I never did music for money. I did music to hear myself in the club, and to hear my creation on the radio.
Instead of me keeping my art a personal thing, we can use it to save lives, change lives and inspire.
