American,Musician
I always want to work with people that I can grow with.
I am the princess of G.O.O.D. Music, the first lady of G.O.O.D. Music, the baby of G.O.O.D. Music. I'm kinda the spoiled brat right now. I could get whatever I want.
Working with Omarion is pretty amazing. That's like my brother. He's really cool.
When I do appearances and stuff and I just wanna see the new pictures, I Google myself.
I'm a MySpace person.
I'm not really a Facebook fan because I don't know how to use it! It's so complicated!
I've got to be comfortable when I'm on stage.
I have a lot of Jordans, a lot of Nikes, a lot of Blazers.
I'm such a tomboy.
Harlem is a stage. It's like its own planet, from the way we dress to the swag in the way we walk and talk.
Kids can't look up to girls who are trying to be growner than they are.
I am really heavy into songwriting.
I have my own publishing company called 'I Am McLovin Publishing.'
I love Interscope, I love Star Trak.
I have a purity ring.
