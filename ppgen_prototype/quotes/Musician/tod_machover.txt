American,Musician
The basic idea of a hyper instrument is where the technology is built right into the instrument so that the instrument knows how it's being played - literally what the expression is, what the meaning is, what the direction of the music is.
Nobody talks about music as having intrinsic meaning, how it engages the mind.
My message is to forget about dichotomies. The 'Brain Opera' is an opera, even if it does not tell a story in the usual way. It is a psychological journey with voice - so I do consider it an opera.
Works of art should be stimulating. They should wake people up rather than acting like a sedative.
My work on hyper instruments started with simple instruments, like the piano.
