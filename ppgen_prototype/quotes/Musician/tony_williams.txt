American,Musician
I think my playing has been orchestral throughout the years, and this is another way of expressing that. But I primarily see it as the ultimate accomplishment of a musician. Composing makes me feel like I've finally gotten all the way up the ladder as a musician.
Drummers don't write - or at least, that's what everybody believes.
I've studied all my musical life, but learning is only good if you do something constructive with it.
