Italian,Musician
When I sing, I always relive a part of my life.
The main goal in my life is to make extraordinary things out of the ordinary.
I can't do a role or character unless I have lived that character. For me, the best teacher is life.
People need heroes, in music and every aspect of life.
I think voice is like a good wine. If you work it well, it will mature.
I like the edge of danger.
