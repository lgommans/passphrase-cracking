Musician
I am a conservative type of person, so sometimes when I'm chilling with myself, people always come ask me, 'What's wrong with you? What are you wondering about?'
Anything I sing is supposed to be genuine. It's not supposed to be make-believe or I'm making something for the crowd to jump or to hold up their hands.
It's always a live experience - anything that happens around you. It's so easy to just put it to a song.
My first encounter with a Kelly was not on a musical scale. It was from primary school. Dave and I went to primary school together and we were like boy scouts.
My grandmother always told me you must keep to your old roads and stick to your original friends and just go through smooth, be careful and stay positive.
People call me Wayne Wonder and it also goes back to football because I could do mad skills with the ball and people would marvel and wonder how I could do it.
That's me, man - I'm a lover not a fighter.
What I say is from my heart. You must be sincere. So when I sing a song, people are supposed to feel it.
