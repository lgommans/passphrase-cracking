American,Musician
Music creates order out of chaos: for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the divergent, melody imposes continuity upon the disjointed, and harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous.
The violinist is that peculiarly human phenomenon distilled to a rare potency - half tiger, half poet.
The violinist must possess the poet's gift of piercing the protective hide which grows on propagandists, stockbrokers and slave traders, to penetrate the deeper truth which lies within.
I can only think of music as something inherent in every human being - a birthright. Music coordinates mind, body and spirit.
