American,Musician
There's really no age limit when you out there in those streets.
Everybody was in struggle, in the grind trying to make it.
I came back to the hood and got in those streets and started doing whatever it took for me to provide.
It was like an honor thing for me to meet 50 cause I respected his whole story.
You won't really get a lot of the mainstream, lovey-dovey side because that wasn't a part of my life in the beginning.
I been doing music my whole life.
I started rapping when I was about 12 or 13, just playing around with it.
Around the age of 14, 15, I was in the studio, serious about it.
I was young and felt like it was opportunity 'cause they were moving units back then on the underground scene.
I felt like if I wasn't around, maybe my shot would be gone.
The people I used to have around me from Nashville was showing love to the Cash Money clique on the strength of Buck trying to make it; making sure Buck gets to where he gots to go.
I was young and so eager to make some money as well as get exposed and show my talent.
I want the world to get a feel of me, showing them the way I am and the way I get down.
With me being form the South, I wanted to make this album like a G Unit.
