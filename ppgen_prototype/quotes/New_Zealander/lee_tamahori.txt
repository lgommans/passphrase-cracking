Always be original. Never duplicate what you've seen another actor do. Be true to the character that you've been given, and the rest will come easy.
A Bond movie falls into a specific genre, and you have to provide certain elements. You must respect the fact it's essentially about girls, guns, gadgets, and big action.
Sex should not be in the movies and should be in the home, and violence should be in the movies and not in the home.
I've always loved the Bond pictures. I have watched every single one. Movies don't get bigger or better than Bond, so I knew this was my opportunity to do a massive action picture with outrageous stunts.
