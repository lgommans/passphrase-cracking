New Zealander,Actor
I think of 'The Hobbit' as more like a boy's own film, like those annuals from the 1930s and 1940s.
I don't go anywhere without clean shoes. That's one thing I've got from the navy.
I'm an officer in her Majesty's Royal New Zealand Navy. I'm a public relations officer in the Royal New Zealand Navy. Sounds good, doesn't it?
I'm a reasonably good actor, and I'm an average naval officer. Ha, ha!
After 'The Hobbit,' I have no idea if things will change. I suspect if I still want to act I will have to put in the hard yards, not rest on my laurels. A lot of it is right place, right time, but I enjoy the challenge, constantly refining my craft, not taking it too seriously but never taking it for granted.
I read 'The Hobbit' while at school. It was OK; can't really remember too much from there, other than the fact I was 10! I never read it again until the script for the film, but it has to be an amazing story when you know Sir Peter Jackson has made three films out of it.
In fantasy land, I wish I could be a pro golfer. I love golf - the most frustratingly brilliant game on the planet.
Relaxing is important; I would like to do more! Golf is a pretty good attempt, but good television, I find, is a great way to chill out and let it do the thinking for you. As long as the programme has got some substance and is well made, happy as a par round of 72!
Acting and the navy seem to balance each other out - I've not surrendered over to the complete process of the navy, nor have I surrendered to the ego-driven process of acting.
