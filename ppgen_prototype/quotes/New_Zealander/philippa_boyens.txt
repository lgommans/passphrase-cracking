As a screenwriter, you have to let go, and you have to hand your baby over and let it go off into the world, which is entirely appropriate.
It is hard to go back into a world that has already been explored, so to speak. And the fans are very passionate about it, and you don't want to burst that bubble; you don't want to break that illusion. You want to get it right. You want it to feel familiar, but also surprising.
