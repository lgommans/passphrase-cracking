Never ever doubt in magic. The purest honest thoughts come from children, ask any child if they believe in magic and they will tell you the truth.
In America everyone's fast.
It might just be me, but it's tough when you get drivers that don't stay where they should be.
When I get in the car I love my wife and kids more than anything, but I'm not thinking about that side of things. I'm thinking about the car, I'm thinking about the race and I'm thinking about how to make the car faster.
IndyCar is what it is and in the back of our minds we all know it is a dangerous sport.
My focus is definitely on the racing.
I'm sure there will be business ventures and things down the road, but I definitely don't want to be a team owner.
I want to win a championship and to win the Indy 500 makes me want it so much more.
Racing, for me and for most people that watch it, it's about personalities.
I love racing and I love doing well.
