The truth is that I am enslaved... in one vast love affair with 70 children.
I am inclined to think that eating is a private thing and should be done alone, like other bodily functions.
When I teach people, I marry them.
I am my own Universe, I my own Professor.
I've got to relearn what I was supposed to have learned.
As the blackness of the night recedes so does the nadir of yesterday. The child I am forgets so quickly.
Love has the quality of informing almost everything - even one's work.
