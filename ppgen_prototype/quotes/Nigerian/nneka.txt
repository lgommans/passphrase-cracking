Nigerian,Musician
If you're able to grow up in Nigeria and go through certain things, you're able to tackle anything around the world because you're able to live wherever, if you can survive in a city like Lagos or Warri or Niger Delta, as far as I'm concerned.
I hope that what I am today is of positive benefit to other people.
Living in Germany Africanised me.
Listening to the type of music I grew up with, like King Sunny Ade, Fela Kuti and experiencing different things and conditions and hardship, as well as the good times in Nigeria, has definitely carved me into who I am.
I must be true to myself within my music or I would be a liar.
At times I have a beat first and then I write. Sometimes I have a melody in my head and I pick up the guitar to develop the song. Other times I just write without any melodies, and I end up using those lyrics when I think I have the appropriate instrumental that would bring out and depict the emotions of what I have written.
I think it's important to learn instruments, whenever one has a little space. Be eager to learn and love your instrument.
Take advantage of educating yourself.
My music is very versatile, very mixed.
In Nigeria, if you say you're a singer, people say, 'So what? Everyone sings.' In Germany, my voice stood out more.
My father is a very strict man.
I was a very conscientious student.
My heart's desire is to be recognised in Nigeria.
I don't want to be a big star. I just want to get my message across.
The way people see Africa is mostly dark.
Everything that the West is today is predominantly because of Africa.
I always like earthy, authentic sounds.
I tend to explain my songs.
