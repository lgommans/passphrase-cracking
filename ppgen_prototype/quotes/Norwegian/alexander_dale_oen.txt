Nothing comes sailing by itself.
In swimming at my level it's about control of the small movements. A good ballet dancer floats across the stage, the best sprinters virtually abolish gravity. All motion occurs in the right direction.
I have always had the sea as my playground.
In my world, I am one of the luckiest humans alive.
There is no single way to train, or do anything well. You have to keep thinking, keep doing things.
