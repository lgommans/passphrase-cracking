Norwegian,Photographer
I have always found photography magical, and became more taken with it whilst modeling.
I just work hard and do things as they come along. But it has been a challenge to learn that I have to say 'no' to things and to know how and what to prioritize.
I'm not afraid of problem-solving. There is always a way.
Being behind the lens gives me a completely different perspective, and because of my blog, I get to do projects and attend shows lending me another angle.
I'm self-taught and emailed photographers I knew if I had questions I couldn't figure out from the manual or online.
I see the Calvin Klein girl as strong, fun, and confident.
Never blog just to put something out there. I would post only things that excite me.
I have my own voice and can focus only on that. I know what I like; I find my inspirations in so many other places than just online and bring that into my work.
I think its important to start the day with a proper breakfast.
