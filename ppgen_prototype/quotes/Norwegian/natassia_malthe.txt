Norwegian,Model
I'd like to someday see myself married to my true love and starting a big family, and at the same time still having an artistic job.
Working on my knowledge and education and learning how to become a more talented and wise person make me feel more sexy.
I didn't have any friends, and I never went to the class parties.
When I'm in professional mode, I do the best job that I can.
It gets boring to me when people talk about clothing brands or what boat they're going to buy next summer.
I kinda lose my mind in 'Fringe,' or at least my character does. Whenever I'm acting, I tend to accidentally become unable to switch off the character. I'm a little bit of a method actor, but without really wanting to be.
I'm very kinesthetic, and when you're that way, you just feel it in your body. I know that other actors think with the logical part of their brain, but I wear my character inside my body, even when I'm away from the set.
