'Until Friday Night' is the first book in my new young adult series, 'The Field Party.'
'Wicked' gave us a story that 'The Wizard of Oz' did not. Two sides to every story.
I grew up in a small town in Alabama, and there wasn't much in the way of entertainment, so like our older siblings before us, we drove our pickup trucks out into the hayfield and lit a bonfire.
I went to Rosemary Beach, Florida, for the first time in the spring of 2012.
Every villain needs her story told.
'Fallen Too Far' was my first NYT bestseller. That changed my life.
Football games on Friday nights followed by field parties every weekend was how I spent my high school years.
All I can say is, I don't encourage younger kids to read my books, and actually, the biggest age group on my Facebook page is 25- to 35-year-old women.
