But if two's company, three's a crowd - and that demands the omniscient point of view.
Understanding POV is essential, or ought to be.
The main advantage of the omniscient approach is that it's the easiest to handle. That's the major reason so many writers select it.
The universal narrator knows all and can enter a character's head any time he chooses.
It's also possible to have two third person singular points of view, as represented by two characters through whose eyes the story is told in alternating chapters, say.
But whatever the POV, and the difficulty of forcing the action into a particular frame, stay within it.
Vesco was always on the trail in search of money.
To fake it is to stand guard over emptiness.
