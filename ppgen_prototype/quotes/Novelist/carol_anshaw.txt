American,Novelist
I have never been on the receiving end of a hate crime, or even a disparaging remark to my face.
I'm never sure who I'm writing for, or who's reading me, but I definitely see myself in conspiracy with my readers.
I never write in a linear way. And I tell students not to. You can only know so much about a book when you first start.
When I started, there was more of a cultural assumption that many readers would find gay characters irrelevant or repugnant.
I don't know where everything is going, but I'm pretty confident that people like books - the objects. So I'm going to go on that -they're not going to disappear.
I think we are all coming to realize the web in all its manifestations is a sucking time hole.
