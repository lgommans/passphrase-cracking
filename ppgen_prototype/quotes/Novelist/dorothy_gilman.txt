American,Novelist
People need dreams, there's as much nourishment in 'em as food.
If something anticipated arrives too late it finds us numb, wrung out from waiting, and we feel - nothing at all. The best things arrive on time.
A man from hell is not afraid of hot ashes.
The best things arrive on time.
