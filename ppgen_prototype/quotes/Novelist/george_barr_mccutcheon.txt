American,Novelist
In course of time my first novel appeared. It was a love story.
It was a bright, clear afternoon in the late fall that pretty Miss Cable drove up in her trap and waited at the curb for her father to come forth from his office in one of Chicago's tallest buildings.
He was imposing, even in his pensiveness.
