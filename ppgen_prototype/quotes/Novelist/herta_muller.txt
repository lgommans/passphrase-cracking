German,Novelist
The more words we are allowed to take, the freer we become. If our mouth is banned, then we attempt to assert ourselves through gestures, even objects. They are more difficult to interpret, and take time before they arouse suspicion.
In writing, one searches, and that is what keeps one writing, that one sees and experiences things from another angle entirely; one experiences oneself during the process of writing.
Writing itself does not know what it looks like while one is doing it, only when it's finished.
What can't be said can be written. Because writing is a silent act, a labor from the head to the hand.
Anything in literature, including memory, is second-hand.
Suffering doesn't improve human beings, does it?
If you live with death threats, you need friends. So you have to risk that they might spy on you.
I have always written only for myself - to clarify things, to clarify things with myself, to understand in an inner way what is actually happening.
In Romanian society, I am not particularly well-liked. I don't often receive invitations.
I never wanted to be a writer.
