American,Novelist
The stories are what they are in my head. They take their own course and refuse to be influenced by anything or anybody. So I just record what I see and hope that people like it.
I learned long ago, back with 'Lover Revealed,' that my job is to sit at the computer, shut up and type. Otherwise? The pictures and the voices go away!
The writing comes first for me. Not Facebook, not Twitter, not the Internet or signings or merchandise, or 'the career.' Everything begins and ends with the writing for me, and I build my entire life around sitting my butt down 365 days a year.
I don't really do indulgences. I'm more interested in discipline, goal setting, and performance.
