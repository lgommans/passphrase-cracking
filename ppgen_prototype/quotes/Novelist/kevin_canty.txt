I would rather eat broken glass and drink iodine than do the dishes.
The moment I'm interested in, the moment I'm working toward in these stories, is when the familiar world seems strange.
The sense of discovery only comes when I'm making discoveries alongside the reader. It feels crucial for me to not know too much about how things will turn out. So I try to develop strong characters with recognizable desires and put them together with other characters and see what happens.
If it's present in the life of the character, I'll write about it. Kitchen, bedroom, church, I'll follow a character wherever they go.
