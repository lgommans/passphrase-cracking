Anne Elliot was the one Jane Austen character I didn't fall in love with. She seemed sad and defeated.
I think that a lot of people I'm close to feel that they went through a period of real difficulty when they moved away from home... You do have to reinvent yourself, and people have to struggle with that. It was really a struggle for me.
I've learned to compensate for my small size.
Female poets in the 17th century had these very confined, restricted lives.
The idea of a piece of literature as a vessel that could contain your life and lived after you had died and been forgotten struck me as akin to artificial intelligence.
