American,Novelist
Old characters never die, but I do need to take a break from them in order to create new ones.
On TV, stories and events are finalized in 30 or 60 minutes, or neatly tied up after a season or two. The best stories are the ones that force us to come to our own conclusions and to explain why we believe in our conclusions.
By using novels, I show ordinary kids confronting and overcoming great odds.
