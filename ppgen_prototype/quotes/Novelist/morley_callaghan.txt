Canadian,Novelist
I know it may sound silly, but I think my short stories have a life and identity of their own. They crop up in all sorts of places.
I'm probably better known for boxing with Hemingway than for anything I've written.
I had my success too soon. Three books published with Scribner's in New York before I was 30.
