British,Novelist
There are two ways of meeting difficulties: you alter the difficulties or you alter yourself meeting them.
Neither situations nor people can be altered by the interference of an outsider. If they are to be altered, that alteration must come from within.
To be in the right is often an expensive business.
Truth, though it has many disadvantages, is at least changeless. You can always find it where you left it.
It is very a dangerous thing to have an idea that you will not practice.
There is nothing final about a mistake, except its being taken as final.
