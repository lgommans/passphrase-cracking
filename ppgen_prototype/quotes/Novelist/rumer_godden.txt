English,Novelist
The stitch of a book is its words.
The motto was 'Pax', but the word was set in a circle of thorns.
For a dyed-in-the-wool author, nothing is as dead as a book once it is written. She is rather like a cat whose kittens have grown up.
If books were Persian carpets, one would not look only at the outer side. because it is the stitch that makes a carpet wear, gives it its life and bloom.
