The definition of a beautiful woman is one who loves me.
It is impossible to treat a child too well. Children are spoiled by being ignored too much or by harshness, not by kindness.
Success in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence. This explains why we have so many stupid leaders.
A man who wants time to read and write must let the grass grow long.
The only real reason to write professionally is that you love it enough.
The world's treated me awfully well, and I guess it's crept into my work.
You're not going to go far unless you're a workaholic.
When you have children, you can't say you're not interested in money.
When it comes to sending my children to college, I want the best education. It's the only thing I'm really leaving them - a good education.
I don't have any contempt for the men who have to have jobs and have to commute and have to pay the mortgage and have to get their kids an education. To me, that's the backbone of America, to coin a phrase.
The American middle class always wants to be upper class and is scared to death of being lower class. It's a highly mobile group of people. They're not like the people that want to be shopkeepers forever, have always been shopkeepers and want always to be shopkeepers. These people mostly are insulted by being called middle class.
People don't say 'Zounds!' anymore.
You won't understand me unless you understand that I am an odd ball.
You don't really know much until you get to be 70.
