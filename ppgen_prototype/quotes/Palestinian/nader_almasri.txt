Palestinian,Athlete
I have a coach but there's nobody at my level in Gaza. I have to do most of my training sessions on my own.
If the Palestinian Olympic Committee or Palestinian Federation provide good facilities to the athletes then maybe I can become better than these Bahraini or Qatari athletes.
I am very optimistic, and I wish that God almighty grants me success to get a qualifying time. Only then can I go to the Olympics. If this happens I will be the first Palestinian athlete to gain a qualifying time. This will be a big achievement.
I feel a freedom when I start running. If I don't train, I feel like everyone else in the Gaza Strip.
I don't have proper places to run.
I practice on the roads of Gaza as we don't have good stadiums and tracks so I gave my best.
If there's an incursion I don't go out of the house.
