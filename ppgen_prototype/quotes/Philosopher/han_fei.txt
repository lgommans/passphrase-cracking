Chinese,Philosopher
A filial son to his father can be a traitorous subject to his ruler.
A ruler makes use of the majority and neglects the minority, and so he does not devote himself to virtue but to law.
The intelligent ruler makes the law select men and makes no arbitrary appointment himself; he makes the law measure merits and makes no arbitrary judgment himself.
Superior and inferior wage one hundred battles a day.
The severe household has no fierce slaves, but it is the affectionate mother.
I believe it is impossible to be sure of anything.
