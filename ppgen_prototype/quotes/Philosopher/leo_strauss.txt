All there is to thinking is seeing something noticeable, which makes you see something you weren't noticing, which makes you see something that isn't even visible.
God is therefore unknowable. This is the fundamental premise of the Bible.
I cannot know anything of which there is and can be only one.
If God is One, and if there can be no other God, there can be no idea of God.
If the highest things are unknowable, then the highest capacity or virtue of man cannot be theoretical wisdom.
But the God of the Bible is not only One, but the only possible One.
God's reasons for communicating with man must be subsumed under his reason for communicating to him his account of his creation of the world - and man.
