I didn't start out with a spectacular movie. Many people think you don't have to go from nothing to the top; they think you start at the top.
Everyone can do a character the way they want to do it, unless the director tells them not to, which isn't very common. I like to do my characters, if it's not specific in the script, as myself.
In 'D.A.R.Y.L.' there was a part where I had to freeze to death, and they didn't even use it. It can get kind of frustrating. But I don't regret that I decided to become an actor. Besides, if I don't like it at any time, I can stop.
