I never expected that. I didn't aim for that. All I wanted was to get some nice pictures of trains at night.
I was one man and I tackled a big railroad. I did the best I could.
I was strong and healthy and I was enjoying what I was doing.
You can show me some stick ice cream and I can tell you if it's good or not just looking at it.
