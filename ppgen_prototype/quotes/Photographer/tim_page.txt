Initial feedback we got from people was that Poker could and should be a product in its own right. For us, that was definitely a case of us not seeing the forest for the trees since we are Poker nuts.
Together, we created the STACKED brand and have really taken the product up two or three notches.
A large percentage of the staff plays both online and here at the Casinos.
I try and play 2 or 3 times a week to stay on my game.
It is really hard to make it convincing enough that you forget you are playing a video game.
First off, the PS2 and PSP can play against each other online.
The key to online play really is multi-table tournaments.
Being able to pit your wits against literally hundreds of other people is really exciting and ultimately the biggest single challenge for a poker player.
