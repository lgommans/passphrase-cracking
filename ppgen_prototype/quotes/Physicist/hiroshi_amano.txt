For me, it's my great honour that many people use blue LEDs or LED lightings now. So, we can contribute to the energy savings for the humans, so I'm very, very happy to contribute to the energy saving issues.
I've never thought I wanted to quit in my research. I would always fail in experiments, which I did at least three times a day.
