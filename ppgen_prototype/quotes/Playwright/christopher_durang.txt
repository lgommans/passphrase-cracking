Laughter can bring a new perspective.
I didn't have a teacher like Sister Mary Ignatius.
Since it's based on my parents, it's more emotionally close to me than some of my more surreal plays. And then I like the balance of the comic and the sad. It should play as funny, but you should care about the characters and feel sad for them.
My parents didn't really know one another.
My father knew the charming side of my mother, and my mother thought that he was attentive and pleasant and was an architect, which was a respectable profession, but I don't think that they actually got to know one another deeply.
When my parents separated, I was very grateful.
I grew up wanting to be a writer for theatre.
Then in college I became obsessed with film, and wanted to be part of that.
On the one hand, I'm grateful to be hired and thrilled to be paid.
Since I also act, sometimes I get over my resentment and commit to the pitch as an acting job.
My biggest problem with organized religion is that God has been imagined as a human being with emotions. I feel if you let go of that, then it's possible to see God as a force, to connect to him or her spiritually.
I never graduated to being an atheist. I only graduated to being an agnostic.
