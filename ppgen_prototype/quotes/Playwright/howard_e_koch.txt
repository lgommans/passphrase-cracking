American,Playwright
You can be a good neighbor only if you have good neighbors.
Uneasy lies the head that craves the crown.
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
The weaker the country, the stronger the smile.
You might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.
If a nation wants to live in peace with its neighbors, it doesn't keep rattling the saber at them.
