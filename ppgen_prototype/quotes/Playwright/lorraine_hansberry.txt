A woman who is willing to be herself and pursue her own potential runs not so much the risk of loneliness, as the challenge of exposure to more interesting men - and people in general.

There is always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that, you ain't learned nothing.
Take away the violence and who will hear the men of peace?
Children see things very well sometimes - and idealists even better.
Seems like God don't see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams - but He did give us children to make them dreams seem worthwhile.
