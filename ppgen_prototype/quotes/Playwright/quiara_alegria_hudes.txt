American,Playwright
I love writing. It makes me so happy.
I'll kind of get interested in a subject and I won't know why. It'll be in my head for many years and I'll say, 'Do I know enough here to research?'
I love researching, I love interviewing.
The best way for me to procrastinate as a writer is research.
I'm half Puerto Rican and half Jewish and so, in some ways, living in many worlds at once is where I feel most at home.
I am myself of a mixed background.
