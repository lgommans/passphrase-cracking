English,Playwright
For as one star another far exceeds, So souls in heaven are placed by their deeds.
I know My God commands, whose power no power resists.
Though men determine, the gods doo dispose: and oft times many things fall out betweene the cup and the lip.
Waste brings woe, and sorrow hates despair.
