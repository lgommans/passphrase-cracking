The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul.
Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are.
Tears are the summer showers to the soul.
Public opinion is no more than this: what people think that other people think.
There is no gardening without humility. Nature is constantly sending even its oldest scholars to the bottom of the class for some egregious blunder.
Exclusiveness in a garden is a mistake as great as it is in society.
