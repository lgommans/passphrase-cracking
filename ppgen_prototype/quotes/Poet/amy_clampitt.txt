American,Poet
Women who are inclined to write poetry at all are inspired by being mad at something.
Everybody has to write out of rage sometimes.
When you get over the anxiety, you discover you should have been mad a long time ago.
Some very plausible stuff is being written by women in a way that most men are not doing.
