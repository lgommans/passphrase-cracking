French,Poet
I'm intact, and I don't give a damn.
Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge.
Idle youth, enslaved to everything; by being too sensitive I have wasted my life.
Misfortune was my god.
I saw that all beings are fated to happiness: action is not life, but a way of wasting some force, an enervation. Morality is the weakness of the brain.
But, truly, I have wept too much! The Dawns are heartbreaking. Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter.
I have stretched ropes from steeple to steeple; garlands from window to window; golden chains from star to star, and I dance.
Life is the farce which everyone has to perform.
Genius is the recovery of childhood at will.
I believe that I am in hell, therefore I am there.
I is another.
I am the slave of my baptism. Parents, you have caused my misfortune, and you have caused your own.
Morality is the weakness of the brain.
Romanticism has never been properly judged. Who was there to judge it? The critics!
