Nothing is so envied as genius, nothing so hopeless of attainment by labor alone. Though labor always accompanies the greatest genius, without the intellectual gift labor alone will do little.
Religion and education are no match for evil without the grace of God.
Love and death are the two great hinges on which all human sympathies turn.
