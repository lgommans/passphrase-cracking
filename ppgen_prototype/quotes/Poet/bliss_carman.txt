I often wish... that I could rid the world of the tyranny of facts. What are facts but compromises? A fact merely marks the point where we have agreed to let investigation cease.
Set me a task in which I can put something of my very self, and it is a task no longer; it is joy; it is art.
There is a passion for perfection which you will rarely see fully developed; but you may note this fact, that in successful lives it is never wholly lacking.
Indifference may not wreck a man's life at any one turn, but it will destroy him with a kind of dry-rot in the long run.
What are facts but compromises? A fact merely marks the point where we have agreed to let investigation cease.
