Swiss,Poet
At my father's request I took up the study of law at the University of Zurich In 1863.
I left for Petersburg in August, 1871 and stayed there until 1879.
I moved to Lucerne, where I have lived happily with my family ever since.
In July, 1892, fate suddenly granted me financial independence.
