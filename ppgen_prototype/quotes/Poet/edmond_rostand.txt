French,Poet
My pessimism goes to the point of suspecting the sincerity of the pessimists.
The dream, alone, is of interest. What is life, without a dream?
A kiss, when all is said, what is it? A rosy dot placed on the 'I' in loving; Tis a secret told to the mouth instead of to the ear.
A large nose is in fact the sign of an affable man, good, courteous, witty, liberal, courageous, such as I am.
