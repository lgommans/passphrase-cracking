American,Poet
I think many people love poetry who don't know they love it. People are sometimes afraid of poetry, or they've been introduced to poetry that doesn't speak to them.
I live in Santa Cruz. I moved here in 1974 and couldn't leave.
I wanted to be a writer since I was in high school, but I never thought it was possible.
So much inspires me. People living their lives with courage, beauty of all kinds, nature in all its aspects, people I love and people I hardly know, and, of course, other poets.
Poetry is the most intimate of all writing. I want to speak first from me to myself and then from me to you.
Garrison Keillor read several of my poems on 'The Writer's Almanac' and I've heard from listeners nationally and internationally. That's one of the great gifts of email.
