English,Poet
All things by immortal power. Near of far, to each other linked are, that thou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.
The devil doesn't know how to sing, only how to howl.
And left the flushed print in a poppy there.
Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven.
For we are born in other's pain, and perish in our own.
An atheist is a man who believes himself an accident.
