Scottish,Poet
Pampered vanity is a better thing perhaps than starved pride.
I wish I were with some of the wild people that run in the woods, and know nothing about accomplishments!
A willing heart adds feather to the heel.
I have seen the day, when, if a man made himself ridiculous, the world would laugh at him. But now, everything that is mean, disgusting, and absurd, pleases them but so much the better!
