Feelings or emotions are the universal language and are to be honored. They are the authentic expression of who you are at your deepest place.
As we get past our superficial material wants and instant gratification we connect to a deeper part of ourselves, as well as to others, and the universe.
When not deeply engaged in creative activities, or numbed out by the TV, I felt empty. My heart hurt. I often felt hollow or as if I were some sort of wispy ghost, barely existing.
Soft addictions are an alluring, seductive aspect of our culture - they are easy to attain and socially acceptable, they are even encouraged in many cases. Yet they are lethal to the spirit.
I learned to be with myself rather than avoiding myself with limiting habits; I started to be aware of my feelings more, rather than numb them.
Only after I faced the unhappiness of my first marriage did I start on the path of personal growth.
We are hungry for more; if we do not consciously pursue the More, we create less for ourselves and make it more difficult to experience More in life.
We've observed that people who stall in their personal growth work often have counterproductive soft addictions that stand in their way of growth and having the life they say they want. It can be a simple thing, such as watching TV instead of finishing a project.
When we learn new behaviors and break through to higher levels of consciousness and love, we can fulfill the deeper spiritual hunger within.
