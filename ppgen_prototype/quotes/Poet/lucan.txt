Roman,Poet
The gods conceal from men the happiness of death, that they may endure life.
I have a wife, I have sons: all of them hostages given to fate.
Some men by ancestry are only the shadow of a mighty name.
Great fear is concealed under daring.
There stands the shadow of a glorious name.
Nobody ever chooses the already unfortunate as objects of his loyal friendship.
