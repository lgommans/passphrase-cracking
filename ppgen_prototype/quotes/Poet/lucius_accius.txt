Italian,Poet
Not at all do I trust augurs, who enrich the ears of others, so that they can enrich their own homes with gold.
Indeed, wretched the man whose fame makes his misfortunes famous.
A man whose life has been dishonourable is not entitled to escape disgrace in death.
Let them hate so long as they fear.
Many, whose hearts are conquered by acute spite, roll out balanced tales from their own heart, which do not balance when you weigh words against deeds.
