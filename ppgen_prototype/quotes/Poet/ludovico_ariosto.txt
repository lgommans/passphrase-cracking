Poet
From heresy, frenzy and jealousy, good Lord deliver me.
Such fire was not by water to be drowned, nor he his nature changed by changing ground.
We soon believe the things we would believe.
Man proposes, and God disposes.
Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.
Nature made him, and then broke the mold.
They think they have God Almighty by the toe.
When the devil grows old he turns hermit.
