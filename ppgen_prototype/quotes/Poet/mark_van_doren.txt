The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.
The genius of the Marx Brothers is for parody. They never are themselves. They exist too abundantly to be content with being that - they must go on, by the rapidest of transitions, to being something else. Groucho, in my opinion the bright star among the three, is never anything but the thing he is at the moment pretending to be.
The job of the poet is to render the world - to see it and report it without loss, without perversion. No poet ever talks about feelings. Only sentimental people do.
To fail to love is not to exist at all.
Wit is the only wall between us and the dark.
Bring ideas in and entertain them royally, for one of them may be the king.
Nothing in man is more serious than his sense of humor; it is the sign that he wants all the truth.
When it aims to express a love of the world it refuses to conceal the many reasons why the world is hard to love, though we must love it because we have no other, and to fail to love it is not to exist at all.
