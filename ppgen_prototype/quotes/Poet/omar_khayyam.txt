Poet
Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou.
A hair divides what is false and true.
When I want to understand what is happening today or try to decide what will happen tomorrow, I look back.
The thoughtful soul to solitude retires.
There was a door to which I found no key: There was the veil through which I might not see.
The Flower that once has blown forever dies.
The moving finger writes, and having written moves on. Nor all thy piety nor all thy wit, can cancel half a line of it.
Drink! for you know not whence you came nor why: drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.
The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon Turns Ashes - or it prospers; and anon, Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face, Lighting a little hour or two - is gone.
Living Life Tomorrow's fate, though thou be wise, Thou canst not tell nor yet surmise; Pass, therefore, not today in vain, For it will never come again.
You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse I made a Second Marriage in my house; favored old barren reason from my bed, and took the daughter of the vine to spouse.
Myself when young did eagerly frequent doctor and saint, and heard great argument about it and about: but evermore came out by the same door as in I went.
