Greek,Poet
Not every truth is the better for showing its face undisguised; and often silence is the wisest thing for a man to heed.
The best of healers is good cheer.
Every gift which is given, even though it be small, is in reality great, if it is given with affection.
A graceful and honorable old age is the childhood of immortality.
The present will not long endure.
Learn what you are and be such.
The test of any man lies in action.
Seek not, my soul, the life of the immortals; but enjoy to the full the resources that are within thy reach.
Whatever is beautiful is beautiful by necessity.
Men are the dreams of a shadow.
The days that are still to come are the wisest witnesses.
Even wisdom has to yield to self-interest.
Great deeds give choice of many tales. Choose a slight tale, enrich it large, and then let wise men listen.
