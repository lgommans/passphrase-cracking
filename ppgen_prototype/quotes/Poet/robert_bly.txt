The beginning of love is a horror of emptiness.
It is surely a great calamity for a human being to have no obsessions.
When a father, absent during the day, returns home at six, his children receive only his temperament, not his teaching.
By the time a man is 35 he knows that the images of the right man, the tough man, the true man which he received in high school do not work in life.
