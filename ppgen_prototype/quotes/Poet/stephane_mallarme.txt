French,Poet
The poetic act consists of suddenly seeing that an idea splits up into a number of equal motifs and of grouping them; they rhyme.
In reading, a lonely quiet concert is given to our minds; all our mental faculties will be present in this symphonic exaltation.
The pure work implies the disappearance of the poet as speaker, who hands over to the words.
You don't make a poem with ideas, but with words.
The flesh, alas, is sad, and I have read all the books.
Every soul is a melody which needs renewing.
Dreams have as much influence as actions.
