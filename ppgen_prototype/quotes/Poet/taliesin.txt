Welsh,Poet
I have been a multitude of shapes, Before I assumed a consistent form.
Reaper of enemies; strong of grip; One kind with his fathers.
From warriors ravens grew red And with their leader a host attacked.
I praise the Lord, the Sovereign of the royal realm, Who has extended his sway over the tract of the world.
