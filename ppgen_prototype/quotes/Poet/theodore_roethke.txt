American,Poet
Deep in their roots, all flowers keep the light.
Over every mountain there is a path, although it may not be seen from the valley.
What we need is more people who specialize in the impossible.
Time marks us while we are marking time.
Love is not love until love's vulnerable.
I learn by going where I have to go.
What is madness but nobility of soul at odds with circumstance.
Love begets love. This torment is my joy.
A lively understandable spirit Once entertained you. It will come again. Be still. Wait.
The soul has many motions, body one.
I came to love, I came into my own.
A mind too active is no mind at all.
God bless the roots! Body and soul are one.
