English,Poet
When affection only speaks, truth is not always there.
Though I be poor, I'm honest.
There's no hate lost between us.
He travels best that knows when to return.
A little too wise, they say, do ne'er live long.
Anything for a quiet life.
Ground not upon dreams; you know they are ever contrary.
