Italian,Poet
I wish it were not a sin to have liked it so.
Such a gift might be easily taken back again.
When we too are armed and trained, we can convince men that we have hands, feet, and a heart like yours;.
Women have not yet realized the cowardice that resides, for if they should decide to do so, they would be able to fight you until death; and to prove that I speak the truth, amongst so many women, I will be the first to act, setting an example for them to follow.
