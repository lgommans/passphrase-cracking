Polish,Businesswoman
There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.
Hard work keeps the wrinkles out of the mind and spirit.
Adjust your makeup to the light in which your wear it.
Whether you are sixteen or over sixty, remember, understatement is the rule of a fine makeup artist.
Daylight reveals color; artificial light drains it.
Men are just as vain as women, and sometimes even more so.
All the American women had purple noses and gray lips and their faces were chalk white from terrible powder. I recognized that the United States could be my life's work.
Leave the table while you still feel you could eat a little more.
