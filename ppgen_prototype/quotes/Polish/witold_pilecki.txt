Polish,Soldier
During the first 3 years at Auschwitz, 2 million people died; over the next 2 years - 3 million.
So they didn't let anybody else off. I can't live like this, I'm finished. Auschwitz was easy.
I carried out my orders until arrested. I had no sense that I was spying, and I ask that this be taken into account in deciding my verdict.
