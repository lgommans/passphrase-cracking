American,Politician
I'm passionate about people. I've spent my life in advocacy. People matter - whether or not we agree on the issue, people matter.
I always kind of wanted to go into healthcare.
I have six children.
It's not that I'm not willing to compromise. But I won't compromise on principles.
I like to run.
I really don't have a guilty pleasure.
