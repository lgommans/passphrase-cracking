Italian,Politician
I'm a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.
The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned.
I turn and turn in my cell like a fly that doesn't know where to die.
My practicality consists in this, in the knowledge that if you beat your head against the wall it is your head which breaks and not the wall - that is my strength, my only strength.
Pessimism of the spirit; optimism of the will.
To tell the truth is revolutionary.
