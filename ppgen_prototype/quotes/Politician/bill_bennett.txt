The higher amount you put into higher education, at the federal level particularly, the more the price of higher education rises. It's the dog that never catches its tail. You increase student loans, you increase grants, you increase Pell grants, Stafford loans, and what happens? They raise the price.
I don't mind paying the taxes I pay, which is pretty considerable.
You can be a virtuous person without faith in God.
I can tell you about the education programs, because that's where I lived and worked.

If you can take my tax money and assure me that it'll go to the right purpose, that it will help the poor, then fine. But I'm not sure a lot of it does. In fact, I know a lot of it doesn't.
It's quite extraordinary to hear a supposedly learned person call the United States a leading terrorist nation, one of the leading terrorist nations in the world. It's false and very treacherous teaching.
It there any nation that acknowledges its errors and its sins and its crimes and the things it has done that are not consistent with its principles more than the United States? No, there is not.
Punishment can do a lot for criminals, and send a message to the rest of society.
Do not give voice to bigotry.
Poverty affects people of all races.
The causes of crime are very complicated. But there is a very big literature, as you know, about single parenthood in crime, about race in crime, and about poverty in crime.
You know, I've taught philosophy for years and one argues in the hypothetical all the time.
I've got a life, you know, take me in the totality of my actions and I'll tell you, I will stand with my record.
