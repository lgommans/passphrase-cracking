American,Politician
Our first priority has to be getting our fiscal house in order - and creating an atmosphere for the private sector in job creation.
I don't know of any of us that want to see any kind of default happen.
I started out, coming out of college, I had my Realtor's license, and I did real estate full time for a number of years.
You look at what happened with Chrysler, it went through that bankruptcy, and it's re-emerged in a much different fashion, privately held in some of those things, and it's really putting out a great product.
I was very young, and I remember this heated, passionate argument and trying to figure out some place called Vietnam, something called a Watergate, and some guy named Gerald Ford who my dad knew who had just become president, and how all these things fit together.
My dad was a city councilman and a county commissioner, so I grew up involved and engaged in the political process.
