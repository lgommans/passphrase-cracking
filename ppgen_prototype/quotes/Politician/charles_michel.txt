Belgian,Politician
Those who think in Britain they can push the Brexit button and not have a bill to pay are seriously mistaken.
In Britain ever more, they will realize that Brexit, well, has consequences - economic, commercial, partnerships. Perhaps during the referendum the impression was given that once the Brexit button was pushed everything would take care of itself easily. Well, that is not true.
I think we mustn't be afraid of the truth.
We are a country that met successes in the fight against terrorism.
At the European table, we are systematically the most determined to advance a strategy of increased cooperation.
I am a rational person. I am moderate. I am humble.
We mustn't be afraid of the truth.
You can be a Christian. You can be Jew. You can be a Muslim. You can be atheist. This is your own choice. But the law, the constitution, the law of the people is above God's law. So when somebody arrives in Europe, people need to accept those rules.
Some politicians were probably too lax about the rise of an extremist, fundamentalist, radical ideology.
Belgium is a safe country.
