Irish,Politician
Discipline and unconditional support is earned by understanding and trust and inclusion. Not by isolation, not by nasty tricks.
There is little or no point being chair of the Labour Party and being ignored when engaging with Labour ministers when you're trying to articulate something that affects ordinary people in society.
If you want respect, you earn it in politics. You don't get it because you are some form of bloody emperor in a toga.
