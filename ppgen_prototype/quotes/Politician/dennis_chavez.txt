American,Politician
Either we are all free, or we fail; democracy must belong to all of us.
We are Americans when we go to war, and when we return, we are Mexicans.
If the Constitution is worth anything, if the Declaration of Independence is worth anything, if the boys who died on the field of battle did not die in vain, fair employment practices are correct and necessary.
So, Mr. President, what is wrong with the fair employment practice bill?
I should like to be remembered as the man who raised a voice against... placing limitations on the freedom of the individual.
I would consider all of the legislation which I have supported meaningless if I were to sit idly by, silent, during a period which may go down in history as an era when we permitted the curtailment of our liberties.
