Vietnamese,Politician
We wait here to meet the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam to discuss together a ceremony of orderly transfer of power so as to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed in the population.
We have been waiting for you so that we could turn over the government.
I believe firmly in reconciliation among Vietnamese to avoid unnecessary shedding of the blood of Vietnamese.
