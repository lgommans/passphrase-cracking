Polish,Politician
A doctor does not ask about political views and opinions - that is how I understand my role.
I am a doctor - it's a profession that may be considered a special mission, a devotion. It calls for involvement, respect and willingness to help all other people.
Taking care of people is the duty of every politician.
To those who don't know the historical truth, I would like to say today, Poland was not an aggressor but a victim during the Second World War.
I have never said I would adopt the euro. Not today, not tomorrow, not in five years. We will introduce the euro when it will benefit Poles and Poland.
To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War Two.
