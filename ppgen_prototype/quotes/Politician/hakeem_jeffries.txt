American,Politician
Newark might be one of few the places where the politics is tougher than even Brooklyn.
During my time as a state legislator, I've pushed for significant investment in public school districts. In Congress, I would look forward to increasing federal public investment in education through initiatives like Race to the Top.
In Congress, I'll work hard to encourage investment in education, particularly with respect to technology and bridging the digital divide.
My job in Congress is to identify projects with federal or some other public component and then to push developers to provide employment opportunities to neighborhood residents.
The political process is rough and tumble by definition, and being grounded in faith in a Higher Power has proven helpful in navigating the difficult terrain.
