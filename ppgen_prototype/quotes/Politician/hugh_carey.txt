American,Politician
All my life, people have been underestimating me.
A mentor long departed told me that the greatest gift in political life, in any life, is to view yourself objectively, at arm's length, to make an assessment of yourself. So whom do I rely on? I rely on myself.
I would like to be remembered as somebody who cared a great deal about people.
