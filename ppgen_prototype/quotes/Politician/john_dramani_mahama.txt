Ghanaian,Politician
With the kinds of progress we're seeing in Africa, we have people who have a very high expectation, and often people think that, you know, things would happen overnight. But I want people to understand that sometimes it even gets worse before it gets better.
I am still a socialist. I am a left-of-center politician. I believe that in Africa, if you see the poverty around us, you can't afford to be anything else.
Happily, there's a reversal of the brain drain occurring in Ghana now. We're seeing a lot of - actually in Africa - we're seeing a lot of African professionals, you know, returning to the continent to contribute their quota.
I think that Africa has made quite rapid progress and a lot of the conflicts that we saw on the continent have abated.
And I think that Africa is making progress that the world needs to recognize and assist the continent to continue on that path.
