After we have calmly stood by and allowed monopolies to grow fat, we should not be asked to make them bloated.
In the broad and sweeping sense which the use of the term generally implies, I am not a free-trader.
Our enormous surplus revenues are illogical and oppressive.
It is entirely undemocratic to continue these burdens on the people for years and years after the requirements of protection have been met and the representatives of these industries have become incrusted with wealth.
The rest is a mere matter of detail, to be settled with judgment, discretion, and caution.
