British,Politician
The day of small nations has long passed away. The day of Empires has come.
In great deeds something abides.
In politics, there is no use looking beyond the next fortnight.
Learn to think impartially.
London is the clearing-house of the world.
You cannot teach old dogs new tricks.
Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities - because it is the quality which guarantees all others.
On great fields something stays.
