Canadian,Politician
Ontarians don't want to believe that they are small people. They want to believe that they're open and that they're inclusive - and I believe that they are.
Social justice is what drives me; it's why I'm here.
People need to see where their dollars are going and what infrastructure is being built.
I do not believe that the people of Ontario judge their leaders on the basis of race, sexual orientation, colour or religion. I don't believe they hold that prejudice in their hearts.
In the same way we have a long-term plan for building roads, we have to have a long term plan to build transit.
My plan is to govern as long as I can.
I came to politics later in life so I bring a different life experience to it.
There is a temptation in politics to look for simplistic slogans and to play the game in a way that looks like you're a savvy politician.
I'm committed to working with teachers.
I think there's not much patience for organized labour, period, public or private sector.
I've been driving since I was 19 years old.
I have no intention of disowning my record as a member of the McGuinty government.
One of the really positive things about minority government is that there is the necessity to broker policy positions. What happens is you get a hybrid of what a single party might do. And I don't think that is a bad thing.
In every election homophobia has been part of the landscape and in every campaign I've been able to become connected enough to my constituents that they know who I am and that I can be elected on my merits.
