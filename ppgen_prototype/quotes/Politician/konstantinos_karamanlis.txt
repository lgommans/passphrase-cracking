Greek,Politician
Irrespective of its size, Greece, with its intellectual heritage and the brilliance of Hellenism, together with the liveliness of its people, can contribute politically, morally and culturally to the realisation of the idea of a united Europe.
I invite all those who share my anxiety about, and hopes for, the future, and who burn with the desire for a political rebirth, to enlist with us. And addressing myself especially to the young, I invite them to become the vanguard in this sortie of national reconstruction. For a proud and happy Greece!
