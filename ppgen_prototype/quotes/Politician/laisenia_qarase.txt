Politician
A well balanced, inclusive approach, according to certain standards and ideals, is essential for the proper governance of any country.
I have always felt that public, commercial and community organisations should be as open as possible about their affairs. They need to be accountable to their owners, their customers, their members and communities and other interest groups.
