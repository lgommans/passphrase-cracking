American,Politician
I attended Sunday School and then church with my father and mother throughout my childhood.
I have always felt that a man's religion was his personal and private affair.
I have confidence that the Unitarian Church will steadily grow and will help to sustain many of my fellow citizens in these important days that lie ahead of us.
I have the utmost respect for the different faiths professed by my fellow men.
I personally have always found the Unitarian faith a source of comfort and help in my daily life.
My family for several generations have been members of the Unitarian Church.
Too many of my Senate colleagues overdid it. They stayed on too long - napping through committee hearings when they should have packed up and gone home.
