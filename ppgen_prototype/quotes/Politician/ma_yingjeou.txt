Politician
I am Taiwanese as well as Chinese.
With Taiwan, it took about 40 years to go from an authoritarian to a democratic society.
Many in Taiwan believe that Hu Jintao is much more sophisticated than his predecessors in understanding Taiwan. He represents a different generation of leaders, more pragmatic, less ideological.
It's very important for Taiwan to maintain its international contact.
I require every Taipei student to swim; if they can't pass the test they won't graduate. Why do I do that? Because I think that is very, very important integral part of their education.
People like to see honest persons. So I certainly will advise many young people who want to participate in politics, honesty is the best policy.
Be honest. Be honest with yourself, be honest with, you know, your fellow politicians. This is a rare quality of politicians.
