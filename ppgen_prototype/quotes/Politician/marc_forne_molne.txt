A country's strategy is always based on a fundamental philosophical outlook.
Discoveries made during the last hundred years have shown that liberalism is the best system to improve a country's well being.
Poverty is not inevitable. It is a human ill that we can fight if we decide to do so together.
This path that we are now starting will be long, and we must follow it to remind ourselves of the great principles that, in our understanding, should always inspire us.
We must guarantee the quality of the existence of the men and women of tomorrow.
