Spanish,Politician
I am in favor of reducing all budget items. But the item I don't want to reduce is the pension expenditure because it affects the weakest part of society.
The main target for the next years should be growth and job creation.
The worst thing a government can do now in Spain is to do nothing.
We have to change economic policy: create confidence, foster investment, cut the public deficit, restructure taxation and reform the labor laws.
We all have our problems and we are working to find a solution to ours and also to help the eurozone. We expect that other countries should do the same, that they be prudent in their statements.
There are countries that are near ours which are in the situation which we all know. I want to say that this is not the case of Spain now and it will not be in the future.
It is no secret to anyone that we are going to rule in the most delicate circumstances Spain has faced in 30 years.
For me, there will be no enemies but unemployment, the deficit, excessive debt, economic stagnation and anything else that keeps our country in these critical circumstances.
There won't be any miracles. We never promised any. But as we have said before, when things are done properly, the results come in.
Spain is facing an economic situation of extreme difficulty, I repeat, of extreme difficulty, and anyone who doesn't understand that is fooling themselves.
Spain is finding it very difficult to finance itself with sovereign debt risk premium so high.
Europe must dissipate any doubts over the euro, affirm that the euro is an irreversible project and act in consequence.
