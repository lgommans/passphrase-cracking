It's amazing to me that, in the 42 years since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women today still receive fewer wages than men for the same work.
My own mother always taught me that fairness was a family value - I think equal pay is about fairness for everyone.
Equal pay isn't just a women's issue; when women get equal pay, their family incomes rise and the whole family benefits.
The Constitution is never tested during times of tranquility; it is during times of tension, turmoil, tragedy, trauma, and terrorism that it is sorely tested.
The Patriot Act addresses various subjects. Some sections are beneficial and enhance our national security.
My own family and thousands of other Japanese Americans were interned during World War II. It took our nation over 40 years to apologize.
