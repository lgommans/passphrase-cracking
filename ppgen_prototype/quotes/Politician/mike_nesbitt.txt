British,Politician
The really big challenge is delivering the social justice agenda in the Belfast Agreement, which hasn't been delivered.
I grew up in leafy suburbs in north and east Belfast, but if I had been born a mile down the road closer to the city centre, you might never heard of me.
I'd like to live in an area of social deprivation because I think it's important to get a feel of what it's like.
I cannot imagine any circumstances under which David McNarry would be back in the Ulster Unionist Assembly group of MLAs when I have control of the whip.
