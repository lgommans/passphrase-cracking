American,Politician
I was raised to believe that we all have a civic duty and a responsibility as Americans to improve our neighborhoods and our nation.
Only a strong America can guarantee a peaceful world.
When I retired from active duty, I still felt that I owed something to my community. That's why I pursued education... I still miss the classroom and recall those days fondly.
The malaise and military decline of the post-Vietnam years under President Jimmy Carter set the stage for Russian aggression abroad and uncertainty among our allies.
