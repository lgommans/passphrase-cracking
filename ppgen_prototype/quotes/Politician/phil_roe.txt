When I worked in a medical practice, our practice provided the insurance. When I retired the next day to run for public office to run for Congress, I had to pay first dollar.
I got elected to run the government more efficiently, lower taxes.
I think our veterans certainly deserve and have earned the best health care in the world.
I'm a veteran. If I go into the V.A. hospital in Tennessee, I want to know that the procedures they're doing to me are being done properly. That is not unreasonable.
