Politician
I wasn't a smart kid in terms of numbers, but, I told them, 'I'm a thoughtful, responsible guy.'
I do think there is room at the very top for marginal tax changes.
I value my reputation. I work hard to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
I think these are very precarious times for women, it seems. So many of your rights are under assault.
You need to remind people that you vote, you matter, and that they can't succeed without your help.
I don't think you want to hurt businesses that are making $250,000 or $500,000. Those are the real people who created the opportunity to put people to work.
