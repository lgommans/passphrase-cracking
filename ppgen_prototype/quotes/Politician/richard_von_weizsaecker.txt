Whoever refuses to remember the inhumanity is prone to new risks of infection.
Seeking to forget makes exile all the longer; the secret of redemption lies in remembrance.
All of us, whether guilty or not, whether old or young, must accept the past. It is not a case of coming to terms with the past. That is not possible. It cannot be subsequently modified or undone.
