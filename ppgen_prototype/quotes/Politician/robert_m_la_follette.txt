American,Politician
In times of peace, the war party insists on making preparation for war. As soon as prepared for, it insists on making war.
Every nation has its war party... It is commercial, imperialistic, ruthless. It tolerates no opposition.
If there is no sufficient reason for war, the war party will make war on one pretext, then invent another... after the war is on.
Before the war is ended, the war party assumes the divine right to denounce and silence all opposition to war as unpatriotic and cowardly.
