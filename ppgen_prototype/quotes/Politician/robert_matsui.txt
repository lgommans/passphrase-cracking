American,Politician
I was six months old at the time that I was taken, with my mother and father, from Sacramento, California, and placed in internment camps in the United States.
Hopefully as a country, that we learn from our mistakes of the past.
I have to say that it's very few countries that are willing to look back at its past and apologize for its act, or make amends for its act, as the United States had one.
I was never given a trial. I never went before any magistrate, nor did my parents. To this day, I do not know what the charges that were lodged against me or my deceased parents at this time.
These are challenging times for all Americans. We face the specter of war abroad and a steady stream of bad economic news at home.
