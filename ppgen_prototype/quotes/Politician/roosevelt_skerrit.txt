Dominican,Politician
It is unfortunate that people believe that in order to democratise something you have to get politicians out of the system.
There is no reason why one should believe you should leave out politicians in cricket or any sport for that matter. There are ways and means in which government can assist in the management and development of players.
What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.
