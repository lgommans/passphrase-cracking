American,Politician
We need not be afraid of the future, for the future will be in our own hands.
My decision on this matter is as certain and final as death and the staggering New Deal taxes.
If you're not in New York, you're camping out.
When you're leading, don't talk.
The law is bigger than money - but only if the law works hard enough.
No man should be in public office who can't make more money in private life.
