I'm not really good at retiring. I tried that one time and Nancy ran me out of the house.
You can tell by looking at me that I've got more miles behind me than I've got in front of me. When you reach that point, if you've got some good years left, you want to make sure that you use them wisely.
Everybody's got to do what they've got to do.
When you coach as long as I did, you can't help but miss those Saturdays - dealing with the players, the game preparation, the challenges, the excitement.
The odds are always against you no matter what your previous history is. You have to overcome the tendency to relax.
