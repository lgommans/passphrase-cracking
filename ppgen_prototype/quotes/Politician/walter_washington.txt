American,Politician
What I would like to be remembered for is that Walter Washington changed the spirit of the people of this city, that he came in as mayor when there was hate and greed and misunderstanding among our people and the races were polarized.
Mine has been a concern for the people, a concern to maintain stability, a concern to get people working together racially, ethnically, rich and poor - all segments of the city.
