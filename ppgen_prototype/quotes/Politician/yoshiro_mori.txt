Japanese,Politician
India and Japan should develop a complementary relationship in information technology.
A vote for Japan is a vote for the future of rugby. We will do our best to make rugby a global sport.
It is my strong hope that an environment will be created in which both of our countries can cooperate for the realization of a world without nuclear weapons.
Japan is the only country in the world which suffered from the scourge of nuclear weapons.
