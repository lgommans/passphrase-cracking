I've chosen my wedding ring large and heavy to continue forever. But exactly because of that all the time that Dave and I have an argument I feel it like handcuffs, and on anger time I throw it in a basket. Poor Dave, he bought me three wedding rings already!
Look at me and tell me if I don't have Brazil in every curve of my body.
Hollywood, it has treated me so nicely, I am ready to faint! As soon as I see Hollywood, I love it.
I say 20 words in English. I say money, money, money, and I say hot dog! I say yes, no and I say money, money, money and I say turkey sandwich and I say grape juice.
