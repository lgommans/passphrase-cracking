Harold Lloyd was not a comedian. But he was the finest actor to play a comedian that I ever saw.
The greatest comedies that were made by anybody were made in two reels; I don't care who it was.
You can't make people laugh for more than half an hour and be consistent.
The important thing, once you get 'em laughing, is to keep 'em laughing until you're through. With a 90-minute feature, you've got to stop the laughter and then pick it up again, which is tough.
