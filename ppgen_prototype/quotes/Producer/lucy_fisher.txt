Just selling through a movie theater is not ever going to be a viable way to make money back on a movie anymore.
The earliest movies that I loved were French movies and Italian movies. I grew up watching those kind of movies and often find the truest looks at human nature - you can find them in another country's movies.
There's nothing worse than making a good movie that doesn't get seen.
I like all kinds of movies. I really do.
