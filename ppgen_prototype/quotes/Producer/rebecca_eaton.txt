I depend a lot on my own judgment, for better or worse.
There's a new television generation coming in every five or 10 years, and the classic stories stand up to being redone.
There's just a big group of actors in London. There are new ones coming in all the time, who are looking for work, and established actors who are interested in working and like to work. To be a working actor in England is a life.
I love mysteries on television - the more psychologically complex, the better.
