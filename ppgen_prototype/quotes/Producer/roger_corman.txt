Motion pictures are the art form of the 20th century, and one of the reasons is the fact that films are a slightly corrupted artform. They fit this century - they combine Art and business!
Jim Cameron is proof that if you are good, you'll get promoted.
When I started in the late 1950s, every film I made - no matter how low the budget - got a theatrical release. Today, less that 20-percent of our films get a theatrical release.
Other writers, producers, and directors of low-budget films would often put down the film they were making, saying it was just something to make money with. I never felt that. If I took the assignment, I'd give it my best shot.
As a producer, I probably am a little stronger than most, since I was a director originally.
One of the worst things you can do is have a limited budget and try to do some big looking film. That's when you end up with very bad work.
