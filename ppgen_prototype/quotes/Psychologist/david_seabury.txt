Nature is at work. Character and destiny are her handiwork. She gives us love and hate, jealousy and reverence. All that is ours is the power to choose which impulse we shall follow.
Manage yourself first and others will take your orders.
The fact, if they are there, speak for themselves.
A wise unselfishness is not a surrender of yourself to the wishes of anyone, but only to the best discoverable course of action.
Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious. Give yourself, if you wish to get others.
Courage and conviction are powerful weapons against an enemy who depends only on fists or guns. Animals know when you are afraid; a coward knows when you are not.
Good humor isn't a trait of character, it is an art which requires practice.
Your desires and true beliefs have a way of playing blind man's bluff. You must corner the inner facts.
Love... Force it and it disappears. You cannot will love, nor even control it. You can only guide its expression. It comes or it goes according to those qualities in life that invite it or deny its presence.
Try out your ideas by visualizing them in action.
No man will work for your interests unless they are his.
He who doesn't consider himself is seldom considerate of others.
If you give yourself to your task at once, you won't have to do it twice.
Intellectual comradeship requires that you think your thoughts through to the place where you can make the complex seem simple, the obscure quite clear.
