American,Public Servant
Sometimes my quotes may be too colorful.
I understood public relations and always maintained a high profile.
While he was president, it was popular to be a Nixon hater.
The difference was you worked for Nixon, and with Ford.
Teaching was the most pleasant thing I did.
No, I try not to be a negative thinker.
Nixon was kind of a loner, he had a cold personality.
I was a stubborn cuss, and I made some mistakes.
I made lots of talks and challenged lots of people.
I challenged things that needed to be challenged at Purdue.
Ford was warm and friendly. He wouldn't embarrass a Cabinet member.
But you've got to make choices, and you're not going to be right all the time.
