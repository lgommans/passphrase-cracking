There's no detail too small for me.
I grew up in a very traditional family, but there was never anything I didn't think I could do.
I remember going with my parents to weddings where the women would arrive covered in black veils, but underneath, they'd be wearing the most exquisite brightly colored Dolce & Gabbana suits. They were like peacocks showing off their tails.
I prefer to be a private person.
