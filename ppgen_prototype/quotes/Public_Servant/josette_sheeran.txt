There's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food - the most fundamental expectation of every human being.
If a child in its first thousand days - from conception to two years old - does not have adequate nutrition, the damage is irreversible.
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net. When disaster strikes - the economy gets blown, people lose a job, floods, war, conflict, bad governance, all of those things - there is nothing to fall back on.
Women are the face of hunger. Hunger has a female face. It affects women disproportionately, and therefore it affects children as well, and it gets passed on inter-generationally, too.
