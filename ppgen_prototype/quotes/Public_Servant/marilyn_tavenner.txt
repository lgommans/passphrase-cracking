To the millions of Americans who've attempted to use HealthCare.gov to shop and enroll in health-care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the Web site has not worked as well as it should. We know how desperately you need affordable coverage.
This initial experience has not lived up to our expectations... and it is not acceptable. While these problems will require a lot of hard work, the bottom-line conclusion is this HealthCare.gov site is fixable.
CMS has a track record of successfully overseeing the many contractors our programs depend on to function. Unfortunately, a subset of those contracts for HealthCare.gov have not met expectations.
