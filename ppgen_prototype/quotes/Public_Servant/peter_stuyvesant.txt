Dutch,Public Servant
I value the blood of one Christian more than that of a hundred Indians.
I am sustained by the tranquility of an upright and loyal heart.
The people are grown very wild and loose in their morals.
We pray that the deceitful race - such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ - be not allowed to further infect and trouble this new colony.
It is my intention to proceed slowly with our trenches.
It is not the least anxiety that we have so little powder and lead on hand.
Our little force will march on tomorrow or the day after.
Praise the Lord, O England's Jerusalem: and Netherland's Zion, praise ye the Lord! He hath secured your gates, and blessed your possessions with peace, even here, where the threatened torch of war was lighted.
The attack did not succeed as well as I had hoped, no small impediment having been the loss of my right leg.
The design of those commissioners, frigates and warlike force is directed rather against Long Island and these your Honors' possessions, than to the imagined reform of New England.
The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here.
To let her dail would be the greatest profit both for the company and for the merchants.
Your patience would fail you if I should continue to relate all the disrespectful speeches and treatment which your servants have been obliged to listen to and patiently to bear.
