Bigger than life is not difficult for me. I am bigger than life.
This is my idea of heaven, coming home and watching the news.

The reason there weren't any, I am surmising, is that a lot of Latin kids, Latino kids, in those days didn't have the money to take those kind of classes.
Then there's the story of ill-fated love. It's universal.
