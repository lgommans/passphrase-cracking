If you have a chance to accomplish something that will make things better for people coming behind you, and you don't do that, you are wasting your time on this earth.
I want to be remembered as a ballplayer who gave all I had to give.
But some people act like they think I live in the jungle someplace.
I am convinced that God wanted me to be a baseball player.
If I would be happy, I would be a very bad ball player. With me, when I get mad, it puts energy in my body.
Baseball has been very good to me.
I am more valuable to my team hitting .330 then swinging for home runs.
To the people here, we are outsiders. Foreigners.
I was born to play baseball.
