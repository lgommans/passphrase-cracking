French,Revolutionary
At last I perceive that in revolutions the supreme power rests with the most abandoned.
Audacity, more audacity, always audacity.
In order to conquer, what we need is to dare, still to dare, and always to dare.
The tocsin you hear today is not an alarm but an alert: it sounds the charge against our enemies.
Show my head to the people, it is worth seeing.
We must dare, and dare again, and go on daring.
In revolutions authority remains with the greatest scoundrels.
