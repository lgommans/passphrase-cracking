Roman,Poet
Let us never know what old age is. Let us know the happiness time brings, not count the years.
Forgive many things in others; nothing in yourself.
When about to commit a base deed, respect thyself, though there is no witness.
No man pleases by silence; many I please by speaking briefly.
If fortune favors you do not be elated; if she frowns do not despond.
