Roman,Philosopher
Nothing is miserable unless you think it is so.
Who would give a law to lovers? Love is unto itself a higher law.
A man content to go to heaven alone will never go to heaven.
For in all adversity of fortune the worst sort of misery is to have been happy.
If there is a God, whence proceed so many evils? If there is no God, whence cometh any good?
Music is part of us, and either ennobles or degrades our behavior.
