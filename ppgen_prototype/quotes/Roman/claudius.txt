Roman,Leader
No one is more miserable than the person who wills everything and can do nothing.
Say not always what you know, but always know what you say.
No one is free who does not lord over himself.
To do nothing evil is good; to wish nothing evil is better.
Acquaintance lessens fame.
To do no evil is good, to intend none better.
