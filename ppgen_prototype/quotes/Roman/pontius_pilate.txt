Roman,Politician
I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it.
Art thou the King of the Jews?
What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ?
Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people; and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him.
Ye have a watch; go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Whether will the twain will ye that I release unto you?
Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee.
What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
