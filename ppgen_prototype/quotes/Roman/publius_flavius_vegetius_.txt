Roman,Writer
In time of peace prepare for war.
We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war.
Few men are born brave. Many become so through training and force of discipline.
Let him who desires peace prepare for war.
The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession.
Valor is superior to number.
A handful of men, inured to war, proceed to certain victory, while on the contrary, numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men dragged to the slaughter.
