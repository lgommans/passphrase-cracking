Roman,Writer
Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.
Luck is where opportunity meets preparation.
Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.
We never reflect how pleasant it is to ask for nothing.
While we teach, we learn.
Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness.
Friendship always benefits; love sometimes injures.
Enjoy present pleasures in such a way as not to injure future ones.
Just as I shall select my ship when I am about to go on a voyage, or my house when I propose to take a residence, so I shall choose my death when I am about to depart from life.
