Roman,Poet
No rival will steal away my sure love; that glory will be my gray hair.
Not only the bull attacks his enemies with curved horn, but also the sheep, when harmed fights back.
By gold all good faith has been banished; by gold our rights are abused; the law itself is influenced by gold, and soon there will be an end of every modest restraint.
Even a faithful mistress can be bent by constant threats.
Tell me who is able to keep his bed chaste, or which goddess is able to live with one god alone?
Let no one be willing to speak ill of the absent.
Although strength should fail, the effort will deserve praise. In great enterprises the attempt is enough.
I am climbing a difficult road; but the glory gives me strength.
Afflicted by love's madness all are blind.
Let each man pass his days in that wherein his skill is greatest.
Every man now worships gold, all other reverence being done away.
Among absent lovers, ardor always fares better.
Age makes all things greater after their death; a name comes to the tongue easier from the grave.
Anyone who is an enemy of mine, let him love women, but let he who is my friend rejoice in men.
Love can be put off, never abandoned.
Love never offers to anyone wings so easy that he does not hold him back with his other hand.
