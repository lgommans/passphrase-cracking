Some brides stress, some don't. I think I'm a serene bride.
I don't want to be a princess who sits on the sidelines; I want to be present and actively involved. It's a life with a purpose.
What's happening to our world? Imagine the year 2000 and our ozone layer has vanished... Our planet has a fever and she is burning up - what will you do?
My foundation is based on helping children, and I hand-pick projects that are close to my heart and home.
Sport has given me drive and discipline. It also taught me to remain humble.
We need to instill the values that are important for future generations, and above all we have to show boys how to respect women.
I had been playing beach volleyball all day, painted my nails red, and threw on a green dress. I thought I looked great at the time, but looking back, I realize that my debut into Monaco society should have been better executed!
Grace Kelly forged a link between Monaco and the movie world, and I would like to create a strong bond between Monaco and the fashion community.
The people I mixed with in Monaco didn't relate to my South African mentality or humor... Although I have met some wonderful people since I've been living in Monaco, I regard them all as acquaintances. I only have two people I consider friends here.
As for the French language, it's probably one of the most beautiful in the world. I speak a little bit and I can follow conversations, but I think it will take time to improve myself.
I personally want to have children. I love children, and I simply can't wait to have a family of my own.
