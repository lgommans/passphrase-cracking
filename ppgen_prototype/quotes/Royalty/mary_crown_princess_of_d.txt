Royalty
I mean, every child at one stage dreams of being a prince or a princess.
I am happy to continue with my journey through time.
Of course we have Queen Elizabeth as head of state, but in many ways we are a kind of republic. We don't have royals in Australia, so it was kind of unusual to run into those kind of people. But aside from that it was quite ordinary.
Time becomes more precious when you have children.
At 40 years old you simply know what life is about.
Naturally, I do things my own way but I'm certainly influenced by my mother's way of doing things.
Seven years is a long time, and he was there for me, when my mum died. He was very compassionate at that time. I couldn't have found anyone better in that situation.
I am, more than anything else, happy.
To be happy is, I guess, the most important thing in life.
I might have some Danish lessons sometimes.
Sometimes you have to keep things very close to your own chest in your life, or this life.
There's not as many people as one would think you can be completely open with.
I think it is nice to get older.
I don't think about my physical age.
That boundless freedom of childhood is so wonderful.
The world is so different for a child, waking in the mornings, wide-eyed and ready to take it all in.
My mother would do anything for her children. And that's how I am too.
