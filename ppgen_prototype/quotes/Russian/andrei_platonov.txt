Russian,Writer
Happiness will come from materialism, not from meaning.
When you've nothing to live for, you get to thinking inside your head.
My body gets weak without truth.
From our ugliness will grow the soul of the world.
The working class is my home country, and my future is linked with the proletariat.
I lived and languished.
If they don't think, people act senselessly.
We hate our squalor.
Without truth I feel ashamed to be alive.
I have a trend of my own.
Does the world have nothing inside but sorrow?
We can't feel anything - all that's left inside us is dust.
If kids can forget their own mothers but still have a sense of comrade Lenin, then Soviet power really is here to stay!
What if we all suddenly get carried away thinking - who will be left to act?
A man who's never seen war is like a woman who's never given birth - soft in the head.
I want my word to be up to the scale of the feat of arms performed by the Russian soldier.
At the time of the Revolution, dogs howled day and night all over Russia.
