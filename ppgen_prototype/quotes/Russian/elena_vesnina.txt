I will remember this day for the rest of my life. There is nothing you can say. It's just like you won the match after the earthquake and it just feels great.
I felt tight from the beginning of the match to the end. I couldn't relax.
I think this is the biggest win in my career. To beat Venus in Wimbledon is just something amazing.
Actually, I really wanted to play against Venus because I have so much respect for both Serena and Venus.
For me it was just important to play my game and believe until the end. Even now, Venus is not in the top 10, but you can still feel she can be back again.
The Williams sisters, they have this power. They have this ability to come back from nowhere.
