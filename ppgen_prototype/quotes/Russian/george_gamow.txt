Russian,Physicist
My mother was the only girl in the family. One brother was District Attorney of Odessa or something; another was teaching classical languages; another was a captain of a battleship of the Black Navy; and still another was a chemist and icthyologist.
When, in school, they were teaching algebra, I was studying differential equations at home.
I learned Einstein's theory of relativity when I was still in school. I simply got interested.
My father was a teacher of the Russian language and literature in high school.
