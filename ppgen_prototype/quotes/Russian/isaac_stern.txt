Russian,Musician
Mozart's music is like an X-ray of your soul - it shows what is there, and what isn't.
Everywhere in the world, music enhances a hall, with one exception: Carnegie Hall enhances the music.
Listen, I will now tell you the truth and there is no other.
Music is like making love: either all or nothing.
There are more bad musicians than there is bad music.
A man possesses talent; genius possesses the man.
