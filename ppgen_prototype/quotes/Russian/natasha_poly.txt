I like Dolce & Gabbana's fragrance Light Blue - it's my everyday perfume.
I like doing my makeup myself! It's a hobby of mine. I like to play around. I've learned all the best tricks from the pros!
I think the skin is the most important thing. If you take care of your skin, you don't really need much makeup.
