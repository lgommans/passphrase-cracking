Russian,Philosopher
The question of bread for myself is a material question, but the question of bread for my neighbor is a spiritual question.
The Russian yearning for the meaning of life is the major theme of our literature, and this is the real point of our intelligentsia's existence.
There is a tragic clash between Truth and the world. Pure undistorted truth burns up the world.
Bread for myself is a material question. Bread for my neighbor is a spiritual one.
The enslaving of the other is also the enslaving of the self.
