Russian,Artist
I would like to reconcile the church and the circus. I wanted to transform the theatre... to get my message across that there is only one God - the living man - the person sitting next to you. That is my religion. I believe that there is a sense to life.
There is nothing in my work that can be taken as blasphemy.
