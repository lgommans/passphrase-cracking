Saudi Arabian,Businesswoman
I never dwell on what I've personally achieved.
I think that Saudi women are very powerful. And I think that Saudi men are the greatest support to Saudi women.
Saudi men have sisters, mothers, and wives, and in my working experience, I have had tremendous support from Saudi men. I really don't think that Saudi women are oppressed or abused.
I think that driving is the least important issue. We as women have a lot more things to tackle before we get to the issue of driving, such as the opportunity to work in any field we choose.
