The nutritive substances used in greatest quantities by mammals are carbohydrates.
The production and consumption of glucose, and hence, the blood sugar level, are controlled by a functional endocrine equilibrium.
Production and consumption of carbohydrates is so well regulated that there is a constant blood sugar level; any accidental increase or fall in blood sugar is rapidly compensated.
The constancy of the blood sugar level is maintained by a complex physiological mechanism, a homeostatic mechanism of the same order as those which maintain the body temperature, the blood pressure or the heart rate at normal levels and control many other functions.
