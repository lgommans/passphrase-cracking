We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, wireless and mobile now - an era of digital medicine. Even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course, there's an app for that.
The integration of exponentially growing technologies is beginning to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick.
As a cancer doctor, I'm looking forward to being out of a job.
In the future we might not prescribe drugs all the time - we might prescribe apps.
