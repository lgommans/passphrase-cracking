Evolution is a tinkerer.
One of the deepest functions of a living organisms is to look ahead... to produce future.
For me, this world of questions and the provisional, this chase after an answer that was always put off to the next day, all that was euphoric. I lived in the future.
I had turned my anxiety into my profession.
