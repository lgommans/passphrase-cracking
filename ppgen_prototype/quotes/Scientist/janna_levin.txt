Black holes can bang against space-time as mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song.
Ambiguity is very interesting in writing; it's not very interesting in science.
I would say the connection between art and science is very tenuous for me. It's just that I'm interested in both. I don't think that my interest in art affects the kind of science that I do.
I think there's a certain lyricism in the telling of a scientific story.
We have never observed infinity in nature. Whenever you have infinities in a theory, that's where the theory fails as a description of nature. And if space was born in the Big Bang, yet is infinite now, we are forced to believe that it's instantaneously, infinitely big. It seems absurd.
The Earth isn't an infinite sheet that carries on for ever, but it doesn't have an edge, either. It's compact and connected.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough.
We have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures?
