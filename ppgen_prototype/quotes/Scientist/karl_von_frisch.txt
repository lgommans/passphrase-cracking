Austrian,Scientist
I studied at a grammar school and later at the University of Vienna in the Faculty of Medicine.
I have been a Professor Emeritus since 1958, and have continued my scientific studies.
After the first exams, I switched to the Faculty of Philosophy and studied Zoology in Munich and Vienna.
I received my doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1910.
