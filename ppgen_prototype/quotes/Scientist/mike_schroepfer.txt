I joined Facebook in the summer of 2008 - before that I was at Mozilla.
In order to innovate, you have to experiment.
My hope for AI and Facebook in the next decade is you can sit down and tell Facebook, 'This is what I want to hear about today.' Like, I'm having a bad day; I want to hear some good news. If we make our products better, more people will use it - people use it more. It's fairly easy to understand.
