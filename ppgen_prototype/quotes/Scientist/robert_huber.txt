German,Scientist
I was born February 20, 1937 in Munchen as the first child of Sebastian and Helene Huber.
I learned easily and had time to follow my inclination for sports (light athletics and skiing) and chemistry, which I taught myself by reading all textbooks I could get.
This discovery convinced me of the power of crystallography and led me to continue in this field.
I remained associated with the Technische Universitat Munchen, where I became Professor in 1976.
In 1970, I had begun work on the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor which has later become the model compound for the development of protein NMR, molecular dynamics, and experimental folding studies in other laboratories.
However, it required some years before the scientific community in general accepted that flexibility and disorder are very relevant molecular properties also in other systems.
