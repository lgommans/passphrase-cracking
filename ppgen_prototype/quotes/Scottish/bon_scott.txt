Scottish,Musician
We meet a lot of people, we drink lots of stuff and have lots of fun.
All the songs we do are basically about one of three things: booze, sex or rock n roll.
That's how I got my name, you know. The Bonny scot, see?
Im more in love with Rock n Roll today than other things. It grows, you know?
I'm a special drunkard... I drink too much.
The more people they can give us upfront the harder we play.
No matter how long you play rock n roll songs might change just as the balls are there, the rock balls. And that's what's important to us.
I've never had a message for anyone in my entire life. Except maybe to give out my room number.
I've been on the road for fifteen years and I had no intent to stop.
I was in a band called the valentines and they broke up last week.
