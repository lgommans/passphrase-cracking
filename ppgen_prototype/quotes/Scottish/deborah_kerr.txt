I am really rather like a beautiful Jersey cow, I have the same pathetic droop to the corners of my eyes.
I respect anyone who has to fight and howl for his decency.
Personally, I think if a women hasn't met the right man by the time she's 24, she may be lucky.
I studied voice for three months to get rid of my English accent. I changed my hair to blonde. I knew I could be sexy if I had to.
When you're young, you just go banging about, but you're more sensitive as you grow older.
All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal.
