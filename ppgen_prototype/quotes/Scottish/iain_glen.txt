Scottish,Actor
With a woman of sophistication, class and modesty and refinement, I become a totally tongue-tied buffoon. I can't even look her straight in the face.
You're spoilt as an actor if you are in that small percentage that works regularly.
A bicycle has transformed my experience of London.
I'm not sure I'm the sort of actor people are hugely interested in finding out an awful lot about.
My first priority is to my wife, as hers is to me, and to our child.
I've been aware of the work I do as an actor being directorial in feel.
I'm happiest when I can just be a director and watch.
I'm too much of a big kid.
As an actor, I'm familiar with having bursts of energy, where you're giving things a try, and then you have down time.
I don't know anyone who's suffered lung cancer.
You really are being quite foolish to smoke.
I don't crave Hollywood.
A big budget studio film is slower, they've got so much to create around you. Everything is more complicated.
