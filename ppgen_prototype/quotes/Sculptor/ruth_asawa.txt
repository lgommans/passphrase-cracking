Sometimes good comes through adversity. I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment, and I like who I am.
Sculpture is like farming. If you just keep at it, you can get quite a lot done.
If a nonartist teaches a subject called art, it is nonart.
All my wire sculptures come from the same loop. And there's only one way to do it. The idea is to do it simply, and you end up with a shape.
Art is doing. Art deals directly with life.
Art can only be taught by artists.
