German,Soldier
We took this challenge before our Lord and our conscience, and it must be done, because this man, Hitler, he is the ultimate evil.
If our most highly qualified General Staff officers had been told to work out the most nonsensical high level organization for war which they could think of, they could not have produced anything more stupid that that which we have at present.
