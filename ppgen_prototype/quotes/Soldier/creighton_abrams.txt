American,Soldier
When eating an elephant take one bite at a time.
They've got us surrounded again, the poor bastards.
It is never very crowded at the front.
While we are guarding the country, we must accept being the guardian of the finest ethics. The country needs it and we must do it.
You people are telling me what you think I want to know. I want to know what is actually happening.
