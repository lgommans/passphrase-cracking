German,Soldier
If the tanks succeed, then victory follows.
There are no desperate situations, there are only desperate people.
Whenever in future wars the battle is fought, armored troops will play the decisive role.
Logistics is the ball and chain of armored warfare.
The engine of the tank is a weapon just as the main-gun.
It is sometimes tougher to fight my superiors than the French.
You hit somebody with your fist and not with your fingers spread.
It is decisive to completely destroy Warsaw.
