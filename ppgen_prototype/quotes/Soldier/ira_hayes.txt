American,Soldier
I am not a hero but the brave men who died deserved this honor.
The real heroes were my good buddies who died during the battles.
I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they're not coming back. Much less back to the White House, like me.
No one ever complains about a speech being too short!
