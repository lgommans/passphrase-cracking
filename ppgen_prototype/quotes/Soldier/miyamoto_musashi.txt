Japanese,Soldier
Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior. Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.
Generally speaking, the Way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death.
Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye.
All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this.
Do nothing which is of no use.
You win battles by knowing the enemy's timing, and using a timing which the enemy does not expect.
