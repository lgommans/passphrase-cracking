American,Soldier
The patriot volunteer, fighting for country and his rights, makes the most reliable soldier on earth.
I am more afraid of alcohol than of all the bullets of the enemy.
Never take counsel of your fears.
Always mystify, mislead and surprise the enemy if possible.
My men have sometimes failed to take a position, but to defend one, never!
