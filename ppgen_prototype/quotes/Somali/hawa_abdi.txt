Somali,Activist
I don't recognize my people anymore. I feel Somalia is lost. There is no Somalia. It is just a name.
At night I dream about going to where I played when I was still young.
Women can build stability. We can make peace.
The long-term solution in preventing another famine in Somalia is to promote self-reliance.
I have big hope for the Canadian government to help Somalia with something concrete and tangible. I haven't seen that.
We women in Somalia are trying to be leaders in our community.
When I decided to become a doctor, I was very, very young, when my mother, her seventh child, became pregnant, and she was feeling terrible pain, and I could not know how to help her. And my mother died in front of my eyes, without knowing why, which diagnosis. So I decided to be a doctor.
