South African,Musician
I'm going to become the Pope next year. Nothing is impossible.
I'd rather have happiness than money. People ask for it. Sometimes when I don't have it. I make other people's problems my problem because they want me to; they ask me to.
I'm so good and so loving that men don't believe it.
I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved.
I am a shocker. I like to create controversy. It's my trademark.
I'd been shouting and shouting and no-one wanted to hear me.
I'm a shocker. I like to create controversy. It's my trademark.
I am proud to be an African.
You know, the more I appear on newspapers, the more famous I become.
Stars talk about how they dislike fans fussing over them, begging for autographs and things like that, but deep down inside, they love every minute of it.
I am angry about the world's conditions for black people.
