I always say that things are meant to be and everything happens for a reason, so I don't have any regrets.
I love living in London but I would like to buy a place in Dubai and spend a few months of the year out there.
I'm not a robot.
Everyone is into male grooming.
I hate these reality TV shows where people walk off Big Brother and think they're A-list celebrities when they've done nothing in their lives, it really does my head in.
It's the weight of expectation that's the hardest to deal with, really, from my point of view.
I have principles in my professional and personal life as to how things are done.
During my time as England captain I have always been both helpful and direct in my communications with the ECB.
People do write books.
I'm always on my guard now.
There's so many differences of opinion in the papers.
I get along fine with the press.
I am very driven.
I can never sit still for five minutes.
In the past I've thrown my wicket away on certain occasions.
I think I had about a month off when I broke my rib in Australia, which was magnificent.
The England team is a team that never, ever stops.
A good four to six weeks is about right for a proper break.
I'm very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain England.
Once you have the support of the lads around you, you can't ask for any more.
The only way to get a three to four-month break would be to tear a tendon or a hamstring or something like that.
I've had to calm down, I have a kid! It is amazing. It's the best thing ever. Nothing better than it.
When I was single I went out a lot. I don't go out all that often now.
I am very fortunate having the job that I do and I want to do it for as long as possible.
The hardest thing is that you can't trust people now. You just can't.
It's not fun facing a ball going 97 mph, trust me.
