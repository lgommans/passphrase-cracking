South African,Businessman
All of my businesses are profitable.
I want money; I just don't want that money lying around.
I like to see a tidy shop, and I want to see my investments well managed.
Shareholders need to have a real interest in the companies they own. Too many are simply too busy - they are asleep at the wheel.
I don't want to be on anyone's board. I just want to have good investments.
