Linux people do what they do because they hate Microsoft.
I work on OpenBSD fulltime, as the project leader. I set some directions, increase communication between the developers, and try to be involved in nearly every aspect of the base system.
I started working on OpenBSD, and many earlier projects, because I have always felt that vendor systems were not designed for quality.
The primary goal of a vendor is to make money.
In some industry markets, high quality can be tied to making more money, but I am sure by now all of us know the computer industry is not like that.
Linux has never been about quality. There are so many parts of the system that are just these cheap little hacks, and it happens to run.
