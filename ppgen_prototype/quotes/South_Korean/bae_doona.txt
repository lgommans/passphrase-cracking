South Korean,Actress
It was extremely difficult to suppress my emotions, because my character in' A Girl at My Door' goes through so many infuriating situations. It was a lonely process having to portray someone that acts tough but is deeply hurting inside and is unable to express that.
Being exposed to different production environments in Korea, Japan and the U.S. was a great experience, and each system allows you to quench your thirst in a different way.
Korean cinema is very improvisational, and there is a unique power that stems from this.
I'm not partial to any system, but at the same time, I'm a Korean actor, so I expect to work mainly on Korean projects.
If my favourite director gives me a role that is very sparkly? A very brilliant character? I'll do it.
I really love learning and working long hours.
In social situations, when I'm surrounded by people, I become very shy. But if there's a camera in front of me, I feel free.
