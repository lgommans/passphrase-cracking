For me, seeing the target and not seeing the target doesn't make any difference.
When I look down the range at the target all I can do is try to distinguish between the different colors.
If I couldn't see the colors, now that would be a problem.
Archery is not a sport for everyone. The equipment costs a lot, and it is not easy for everyone to find a place to play. It is perhaps similar to golf, but of course there are more golf courses than archery fields.
Archery requires very sensitive muscles.
I used to play football at school, and I enjoyed really physical sports, but I now try to avoid any sports that might build up different muscles. That might have a negative impact on my archery.
I had a strong desire to become an archer from the very first time I tried it. I forgot my other ambitions. I just wanted to compete in the Olympics.
I've had some surgery and shoulder problems.
I try not to push myself too hard, but I also need to perform and earn the results.
