South Korean,Musician
In the midst of hardship, it was the music that restored my soul.
I might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair.
Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.
When you are in depression, almost magically, nothing motivates you.
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few.
Classical music can rock you!
I want to make my music a genre that people can immediately identify: something that never existed.
I would not want the limitations held by the name of a classical musician. I want many people to enjoy my music much beyond just classical music fans. I think the term, 'violinist,' keeps me distant from the audience. I want to communicate with them more.
Consolation of music is different from the one of words. It starts from the inside... It cries with you instead of telling you to stop crying.
