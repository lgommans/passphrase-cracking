South Korean,Actor
While acting in 'W,' my worries about the way I act settled down. I also discovered another side of myself. It was a turning point.
In 'W,' I did not change a word in the script. I have never spoken this much in other series. I just stick to whatever is written. I always carry the script with me and read it before I sleep.
