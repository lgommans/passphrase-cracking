Spanish,Poet
If fame is to come only after death, I am in no hurry for it.
Conceal a flaw, and the world will imagine the worst.
There is no living with thee, nor without thee.
Be content to be what you are, and prefer nothing to it, and do not fear or wish for your last day.
Glory comes too late, after one as been reduced to ashes.
Glory paid to our ashes comes too late.
You give me nothing during your life, but you promise to provide for me at your death. If you are not a fool, you know what I wish for!
Fortune gives too much to many, enough to none.
A man who lives everywhere lives nowhere.
