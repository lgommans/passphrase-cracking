My new life goes beyond my dreams because my dream was Formula One and I achieved it. I'm a driver, I feel like a driver. I have won this race because I am alive.
I have motorsport in my DNA and there's no way I can stay away from that world.
At the end of the day, my natural habitat is in a car and I am happiest in that environment.
I felt deeply loved, highly respected by my colleagues and everybody in the world of motorsport.
Even now that I only have one eye, maybe I see more things than before. My life was completely against the clock, a fight against the stopwatch.
