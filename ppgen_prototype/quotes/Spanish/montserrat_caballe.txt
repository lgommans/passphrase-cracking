Drama if I sing, drama if I don't sing. What do you do?
When a singer truly feels and experiences what the music is all about, the words will automatically ring true.
If I cannot sing, I have the impression that I no longer exist. I mean it. I mean that I am not physically there.
I am not a person who can do nothing. I get very bored.
I love to sing with my daughter. Audiences like it because a mother-daughter pairing is a curiosity.
You are born with a sound; everyone is, less or more. And this sound has to be developed. I am not talking about vocal technique; I am not talking about how to sing. I am talking about how to produce a sound.
A soprano's voice is a little like a mother's cry, which is why it attracts all human beings.
The sound of a mother's voice expresses a feeling of intimacy, which has a truly magical effect on the listener.
I've received many awards, but I'm most proud of the ones for my country's music.
