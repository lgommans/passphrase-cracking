Vietnamese,Statesman
In this decisive hour of our national history, union means life and division means death.
Henceforth, we shall be happy to be a free citizen in an independent country.
As for us, during twenty years' reign, we have known much bitterness.
I do not wish a foreign army to spill the blood of my people.
I would prefer to be a citizen of an independent country rather than Emperor of an enslaved one.
If your government had given me a thousandth of the sum it spent to depose me, I could have won that war.
The time has come to put an end to the fratricidal war and to recover at last peace and accord.
