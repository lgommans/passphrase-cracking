I wish to express my hope that the efforts of our nations, nationalities and peoples in the direction of the development of our democratic order will be successful.
Thanks to the heroic sons and daughters of this country, who have paid sacrifices, we have been able to score a number of victories which are encouraging the nation-building process we are engaged in.
The labour of the farmers, no doubt is of greater value than the financial capacity of the government and non-government institutions which can only play a supportive role.
