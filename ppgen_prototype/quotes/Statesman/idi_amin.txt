Statesman
You cannot run faster than a bullet.
In any country there must be people who have to die. They are the sacrifices any nation has to make to achieve law and order.
Sometimes people mistake the way I talk for what I am thinking.
I was a good soldier in the British Army. I was born in a very, very poor family. And I enlisted to escape hunger. But my officers were Scottish and they loved me. The Scots are good, you know.
If we knew the meaning to everything that is happening to us, then there would be no meaning.
I love the Americans. They are my best friends.
I am the hero of Africa.
It's not for me. I tried human flesh and it's too salty for my taste.
I'm a good Muslim and I'm only interested in Islam.
I want to be remembered as a great athlete. As a boxing champion.
I myself consider myself the most powerful figure in the world.
