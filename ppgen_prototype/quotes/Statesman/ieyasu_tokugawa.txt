Japanese,Statesman
Give the peasants neither life nor death.
Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not.
When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou has passed through.
Find fault with thyself rather than with others.
Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the natural lot of mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair.
Forbearance is the root of quietness and assurance forever.
Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden.
