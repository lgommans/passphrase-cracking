The president is here, strong and firm as a monkey's tail.
It is the destiny of the people of Haiti to suffer.
In 25 years of exile, I've never had a frozen account, either in Switzerland or elsewhere in the world.
When people talk to me about tyranny, it makes me laugh and gives me the impression that people suffer from amnesia.
I'm the one who initiated the democratic process.
I am currently in Haiti to help the Haitian people in their reconstruction.
There has not been one day since I left that I have not thought about Haiti.
I never had the financial means that the media said I had. I laugh when I hear the amounts, $400 million, $800 million. Where do they get this imagination?
I want to take this opportunity to express, one more time, my deep sadness to those countrymen who feel, rightly, that they were victims of my government.
All I know is politics. Really, politics takes up most of my time; it's nonstop.
