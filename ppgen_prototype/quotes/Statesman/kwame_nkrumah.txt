Ghanaian,Statesman
Freedom is not something that one people can bestow on another as a gift. Thy claim it as their own and none can keep it from them.
We face neither East nor West: we face forward.
Revolutions are brought about by men, by men who think as men of action and act as men of thought.
A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny. It is this factor which makes neo-colonialism such a serious threat to world peace.
We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquility.
The best way of learning to be an independent sovereign state is to be an independent sovereign state.
