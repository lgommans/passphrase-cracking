Russian,Statesman
God will not forgive us if we fail.
One sits the whole day at the desk and appetite is standing next to me. 'Away with you', I say. But Comrade Appetite does not budge from the spot.
Whatever else may divide us, Europe is our common home; a common fate has linked us through the centuries, and it continues to link us today.
We should not pour muck on ourselves.
