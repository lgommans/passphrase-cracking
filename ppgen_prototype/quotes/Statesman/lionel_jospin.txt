French,Statesman
I would like to see capital punishment suppressed in all democracies.
If French is no longer the language of a power, it can be the language of a counter power.
I remain attached to my nation.
Co-operation between governments still plays an important role and will remain indispensable.
I do not separate France from Europe.
The fight against terror is a common imperative for democracies and must become so for all nations.
We must lead in a different way... We must have an active president, who gives strong direction and works with the government for its implementation.
