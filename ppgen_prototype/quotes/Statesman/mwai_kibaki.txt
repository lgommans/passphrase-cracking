Leadership is a privilege to better the lives of others. It is not an opportunity to satisfy personal greed.
Let us reject violence and selfishness which could destroy our country's unity.
The era of 'anything goes' is gone for ever.
May hard work, and justice, always cement our bonds of unity that we may get our country back to production.
The constitution is the ultimate custodian of social will and its making should be accorded all due diligence.
My government will respect the will of the people.
Government will no longer be run on the whims of individuals.
