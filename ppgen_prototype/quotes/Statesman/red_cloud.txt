Statesman
We do not want riches, we want peace and love.
They made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one; they promised to take our land, and they took it.
The Great Spirit will not make me suffer because I am ignorant. He will put me in a place where I shall be better off than in this world.
When I was a young man, I was poor. In a war with other nations, I was in eighty-seven fights. There I received my name and was made Chief of my nation. But now I am old and am for peace.
I am poor and naked, but I am the chief of the nation. We do not want riches but we do want to train our children right. Riches would do us no good. We could not take them with us to the other world. We do not want riches. We want peace and love.
You whites make all the ammunition.
The whites are the same everywhere. I see them every day.
Even if you live forty or fifty years in this world, and then die, you cannot take all your goods with you.
The whites, who are educated and civilized, swindle me, and I am not hard to swindle because I do not know how to read and write.
The white man has got the gold out of the land which belonged to the red man.
