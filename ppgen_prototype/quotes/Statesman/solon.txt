Greek,Statesman
Society is well governed when its people obey the magistrates, and the magistrates obey the law.
Speech is the mirror of action.
Rich people without wisdom and learning are but sheep with golden fleeces.
Call no man happy before he dies, he is at best but fortunate.
I grow old learning something new every day.
In giving advice seek to help, not to please, your friend.
Learn to obey before you command.
Put more trust in nobility of character than in an oath.
Let no man be called happy before his death. Till then, he is not happy, only lucky.
No man is happy; he is at best fortunate.
Call no man happy until he is dead, but only lucky.
No one can be said to be happy until he is dead.
