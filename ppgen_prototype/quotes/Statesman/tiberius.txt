Roman,Statesman
It is the duty of a good shepherd to shear his sheep, not to skin them.
Let them hate me, provided they respect my conduct.
I shall always be consistent and never change my ways so long as I am in my senses; but for the sake of precedent the Senate should beware of binding itself to support the acts of any man, since he might through some mischance suffer a change.
To have command is to have all the power you will ever need. To have all the power you will ever need, is to have the world in the palm of you hand.
Power has no limits.
