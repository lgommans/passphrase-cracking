Statesman
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves.
The war we have to wage today has only one goal and that is to make the world safe for diversity.
Wars begin in the minds of men, and in those minds, love and compassion would have built the defenses of peace.
