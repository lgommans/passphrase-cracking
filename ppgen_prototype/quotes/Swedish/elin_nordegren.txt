Forgiveness takes time. It is the last step of the grieving process.
Money can't buy happiness. Or put my family back together.
I have confidence in my beliefs, my decisions, and myself.
I believe in love because I've seen it. I've been there.
I know how fortunate I am.
I grew up with great relationships with my stepparents.
In general, in any kind of stepparent relationship, I'm happy that there's somebody else loving my children.
My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children, and we are doing really good - we really are - and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father.
