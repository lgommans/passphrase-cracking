A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.
A kiss is a secret told to the mouth instead of the ear; kisses are the messengers of love and tenderness.
I was the shyest human ever invented, but I had a lion inside me that wouldn't shut up!
Be yourself. The world worships the original.
I have no regrets. I wouldn't have lived my life the way I did if I was going to worry about what people were going to say.
Happiness is good health and a bad memory.
I don't think anyone has the right to intrude in your life, but they do. I would like people to separate the actress and the woman.

Cancer victims who don't accept their fate, who don't learn to live with it, will only destroy what little time they have left.
If you took acting away from me, I'd stop breathing.
I have grown up alone. I've taken care of myself. I worked, earned money and was independent at 18.

Time is shortening. But every day that I challenge this cancer and survive is a victory for me.
Until 45 I can play a woman in love. After 55 I can play grandmothers. But between those ten years, it is difficult for an actress.
I can do everything with ease on the stage, whereas in real life I feel too big and clumsy. So I didn't choose acting. It chose me.
I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.
Never again! I can see no reason for marriage - ever at all. I've had it. Three times is enough.
