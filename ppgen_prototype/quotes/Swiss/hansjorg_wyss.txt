Swiss,Businessman
I am very grateful for the opportunities I've had and feel I have a duty to repay my good fortune through philanthropic endeavors that expand the reach of human possibility and compassion.
Nobody knows me, and I hope that it stays like this.
We have so many rich people in Switzerland. They should take more responsibility for the general public. There is almost no tradition of philanthropy here anymore, unlike in the U.S.
Two things are vital for me. I've always had people who protected me, and I've always had people who helped me. Before I decide, I consult with three, four people who I trust.
