Life is one long decay, no? There's a lot of beauty in it. Like the patina in an old city.
I love seeing tattoos on 60-year-olds who have had them for 40 years.
I think when tattoos are new and colorful, they look bad. But they look better the older and more bleached out they become.
I always have a lot of things going on because some things take years to make and others take five minutes. I like that there's always something going on. Working doesn't have such a momentous feel - like it's all or nothing.
Many artists who don't go off to art school come to New York. It's about what you learn when you're here.
You basically only discover a new thing once.
Take a relief. You draw it, you carve it out. Later you build it up from a flat surface. There is no other way to do a sculpture - you either add or you subtract.
What is the art world? I never really understood. I started doing this stuff to do what I want to do. Not to be this or that.
