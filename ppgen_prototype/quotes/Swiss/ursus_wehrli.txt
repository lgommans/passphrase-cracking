Swiss,Comedian
I like to turn things upside down, to watch pictures and situations from another perspective.
One way to organize your thoughts is to tidy up, even if it's in places where it makes no sense at all.
Our everyday lives are filled with complex decisions. We long for simplicity and ordinariness.
I am always fascinated by the structure of things; why do things work this way and not that way.
What I do, basically, is look at things from different angles. That is what I do on stage comedically, and that is what I do in art. I was always fascinated by the structure of things, why things work this way and not that way. So I like to see how things behave if you change the point of view.
Comedians take a neat situation and turn it into a mess. And in my books I do the same thing, but it's the other way around. I like to mess around with mess. A mess is only a mess because someone tells you it is.
