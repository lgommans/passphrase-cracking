Theologian
The poison of selfishness destroys the world.
The soul, who is lifted by a very great and yearning desire for the honor of God and the salvation of souls, begins by exercising herself, for a certain space of time, in the ordinary virtues, remaining in the cell of self-knowledge, in order to know better the goodness of God towards her.
In the light of faith I am strong, constant, and persevering.
As the hart desires the spring of living water, so my soul desires to leave the prison of this dark body and see You in truth.
You, Eternal Trinity, are my Creator, and I am the work of Your hands, and I know through the new creation which You have given me in the blood of Your Son, that You are enamored of the beauty of Your workmanship.
Build a cell inside your mind, from which you can never flee.
