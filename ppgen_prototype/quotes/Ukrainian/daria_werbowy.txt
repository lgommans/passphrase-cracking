Ukrainian,Model
Sailing is the closest I can get to nature - it's adrenaline, fear, a constant challenge and learning experience, an adventure into the unknown. And of course there is nothing better than wearing the same T-shirt for days and not brushing my hair for weeks.
India is such a hospitable country.
I've always wanted to break the stereotype of being a model.
When I was a kid, everywhere I went people said I should be a model, but I was more into skateboarding.
I suppose it's the feminist in me, but I didn't always associate modelling with an intelligent career. I used to put myself down for doing it.
There's an art to making something look good when, on a hanger, it's just a black coat.
I am not a big facial person. But I do love a body scrub.
When I'm working, I always make time to get exercise into my schedule.
I'm not a big planner when I travel; I just feel it out.
I've been taking photographs since I was a teenager, and fashion has taught me a lot more about photography. It's definitely inspired me.
I can't analyse my appeal. If I did, I'd be in a straitjacket.
I guess a lot of people don't realise, but I'm always playing a character when I'm working. When you're always having people's images projected on you, who 'Daria' is as a person sort of disappears.
I've never had to rebel against my parents; I never had that sort of teen-angst thing where you didn't get along with them. My dad's always been my buddy.
Home is your sanctuary.
The older I get, the less I need. I wear the same jean shorts for the whole week. I'm not running to the store to get the latest bag.
I think one of the secrets to modelling is the less you care and the more you're yourself, the more successful you are.
