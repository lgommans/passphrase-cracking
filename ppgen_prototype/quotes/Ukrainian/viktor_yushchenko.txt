Ukrainian,Statesman
The regime is afraid of the people because it knows that free and fair elections will bring about its end.
There is only one conflict in Ukraine today and it is between the regime and the people.
Our mothers and fathers want change. They worked all of their lives, but today live in destitution.
The conviction of our Ukrainian nation is embedded in the pages of its history.
Ukraine must once again be revered and respected by its citizens as well as the East and the West.
We can and must turn this page if we are friends and are prepared to look one another in the eye.
We want work and we want honest jobs. Our minds and our hands will be our keep!
