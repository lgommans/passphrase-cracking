Venezuelan,Model
I think the Miss Universe title not only gives me the opportunity to become a role model for Latina girls around the world, but to show that beauty isn't just about the outside.
I would like to show that I have a heart, that I am a human being and I have feelings. And to be this kind of role model, not only for beauty pageants but also for life.
I always work on my abs, every single day. As Miss Universe, exercising your abdominal muscles is mandatory!
I have a very balanced posture about the political situation in my country.
As a queen, I speak about unity and respect. I think that is the most important thing.
I love to eat cucumber sticks with yogurt. It's a great snack to have at home, especially when I'm having house guests.
I always make my favorite pancakes with milk, and I also add some fruit - like a banana or apple with some cinnamon sprinkled on top. I also sometimes put peanut butter on my pancakes!
An egg white omelet with vegetables is one of my favorite breakfasts.
