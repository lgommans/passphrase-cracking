I'm from Miami, I love it when we're out in the heat. When it's cold, I'm like, 'I'm never acting again,' because it's too freezing.
I would say that it's a lot easier, especially if you have a bit of an attention deficit disorder, to be on a movie because you can give it your all, and kill yourself for however many months, and then let it go.
If you try to kill yourself for a role on the TV show, you'll succeed. It's too long, it's too much. So, it's tough, but the challenge is a good thing.
It's so funny, actors usually have a directing ambition. I've got no ambition for directing.
I'm not girly girly enough to care how I look on TV, or if I'm wearing the correct make up.
