It's very surreal. It seems like everywhere I go, people always talk about 'Indiana Jones,' and I realized over the years it has made a huge impact on their childhoods... I feel very fortunate to be a part of this.
I always loved acting, but when you get older and you're going through adolescence, the roles are limited.
As a kid, I always wanted to be like Spielberg and to make wonderful movies. Even when I was making 'Indiana Jones,' I was looking at how he would come up with these amazing shots and how he would choreograph the blocking and all that. So I knew from early on I would go to film school and try to work behind the camera.
The only thing I didn't like as a kid was I was required to do a minimum of 3 hours of schoolwork every day, and there was a tutor on set.
