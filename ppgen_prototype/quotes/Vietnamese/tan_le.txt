I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear.
It is okay to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene - and not just okay, but something to be thankful for... Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
You don't just wake up one day with dementia or Alzheimer's; these conditions are developmental. Even when a problem triggers the need to collect data, it's reviewed by a specialist and filed away. There's no central repository allowing information to be shared across a multitude of researchers worldwide.
I am afraid of privilege, of ease, of entitlement.
! want to leverage the creativity of researchers across mathematics, statistics, data mining, computer science, biology, medicine, and the public at large.
Our understanding of the human brain can be dramatically accelerated if we collect and share research data on an exponentially wider scale.
The brain is the cornerstone of virtually every facet of our lives. I wish we knew more.
