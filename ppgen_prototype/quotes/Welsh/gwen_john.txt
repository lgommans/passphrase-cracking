Welsh,Artist
In talking, shyness and timidity distort the very meaning of my words. I don't pretend to know anybody well. People are like shadows to me and I am like a shadow.
Aloneness is nearer God, nearer reality.
To be reserved, secretive, with a passionate violence that causes suffering.
When I was a child, I used to cry all the time.
