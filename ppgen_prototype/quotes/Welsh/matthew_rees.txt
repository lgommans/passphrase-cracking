I think the most important thing in life is your health. If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.
It was a great thing for the Blues boys to do in terms of shaving their hair off for me. The whole squad did it. At first I thought it was only going to be a handful of boys, but fair play, they all did it, and a few of the coaches as well.
I've been truly overwhelmed by the good luck messages I have received from the rugby world and the fantastic support I've had from my friends, family, my team-mates and staff at Cardiff Blues and the WRU throughout my treatment. It has meant a huge amount to me.
I was overwhelmed with messages of support I received from people around the rugby world. Sometimes you take it for granted, but I can't thank people enough for how much they supported me.
