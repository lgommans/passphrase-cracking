Welsh,Royalty
And in that I cannot send unto you all my businesses in writing, I despatch these present bearers fully informed in all things, to whom it may please you to give faith and credence in what they shall say unto you by word of mouth.
Dread lord and cousin, may the almighty preserve your reverence and lordship in long life and good fortune.
Most redoubted lord and right sovereign cousin, may the Almighty Lord have you in his keeping.
