Hockey is the original extreme sport.
I do look better on TV. In real life, I look scruffy and pale, and I get the worst kind of recognition... I get the 'Haven't we met somewhere before?' I suggest it might be because I'm on the telly, and they say, 'No, it's definitely not that. Wasn't it at so-and-so's party?'
Being a father is just great. I love every minute - even the rubbish, middle-of-the night stuff.
