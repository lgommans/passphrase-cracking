British,Writer
I see myself as a recovering journalist.
I am a print addict. I have an ebook and a computer but I remain hooked on print.
My feelings towards the newspapers are very affectionate.
Apparently when I went to school, I had a Glasgow accent.
My father used to get me to read the newspaper to him, as if I was a radio. I would stand there and read the 'Times.'
That's what I really wanted to do when I was 16, be in comics!
One good thing about leaving daily journalism was that I was no longer obliged to read all the book prize short lists.
