Irish,Writer
I was utterly without worldly ambition because I knew that all that was needed for a rich, full life was a few shillings a week with which to buy SF magazines and beer.
I write science fiction for people who don't read a great deal of science fiction.
The universe is wonderful, but only when there is somebody there to wonder at it.
