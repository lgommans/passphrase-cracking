Writer
I write in a rush of memory.
I hardly ever think about audience. I just try to tell a story for me. I write the kind of story I would like to read.
I didn't have my own journals, but my mother kept a journal while I was in the hospital, and my father wrote newsletters to keep friends and family updated on my progress.
Maybe I would have become an actor. I was a very outgoing kid, but being in the hospital - being outside of social action for so long - turned me into an observer. Actually, right after I got out of the hospital, I did start writing a novel, but the book was so transparently about me that I stopped.
Now I'm trying to work outside first person. I do plan to write more books.
