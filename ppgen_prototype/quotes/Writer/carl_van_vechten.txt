An ordinary kitten will ask more questions than any five-year-old.
A cat is never vulgar.
As an inspiration to the author, I do not think the cat can be over-estimated. He suggests so much grace, power, beauty, motion, mysticism. I do not wonder that many writers love cats; I am only surprised that all do not.
The cat, it is well to remember, remains the friend of man because it pleases him to do so and not because he must.
There is, indeed, no single quality of the cat that man could not emulate to his advantage.
