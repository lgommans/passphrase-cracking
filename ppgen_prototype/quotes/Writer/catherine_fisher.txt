Welsh,Writer
With the novels, I try to write a few pages a day - it doesn't sound much, but it can be difficult if I'm not sure where the story is going.
I often write in pencil on paper and then type up later. It's much quicker than using a keyboard.
I always was going to be a writer. The other jobs were just to keep me in food. Though I enjoyed the archaeology.
