American,Writer
It is my belief that everything you need to know about the world can be learned in a church choir.
Writers are too neurotic to ever be happy.
I have never written anything in one draft, not even a grocery list, although I have heard from friends that this is actually possible.
Fred Astaire is my hero. I love him because he was willing to kill himself to make his art look effortless. And because he proved it's possible to be an artist and a good person.
I hate sequels. They're never as good as the first book.
I am a Colorado native, and, no, I did not vote for the anti-gay amendment or the same-sex marriage ban, and I am not a member of a militia.
I watched the entire O.J. Simpson trial, and he was guilty.
Science fiction is an amazing literature: plot elements that you would think would be completely worn out by now keep changing into surprising new forms.
I have great faith in the future of books - no matter what form they may take - and of science fiction.
