The bizarre world of cards is a world of pure power politics where rewards and punishments are meted out immediately.
A deck of cards is built like the purest of hierarchies, with every card a master to those below it, a lackey to those above it.
God and the politicians willing, the United States can declare peace upon the world, and win it.
