My degrees are in anthropology, and I have friends who have worked with apes.
I was pretty young when I saw the original 'Planet of the Apes', and for a time in the seventies, I was pretty obsessed with it.
It takes a while to get a movie together, and they don't start talking books until the movie is close to being finished.
