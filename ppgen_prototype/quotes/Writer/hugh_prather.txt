Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes.
Almost any difficulty will move in the face of honesty. When I am honest I never feel stupid. And when I am honest I am automatically humble.
Negative feedback is better that none. I would rather have a man hate me than overlook me. As long as he hates me I make a difference.
Whenever we condemn, we cloak the world in pain.
If the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write.
To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.
