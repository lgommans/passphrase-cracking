Anyone who thinks there's safety in numbers hasn't looked at the stock market pages.
Today, if you are not confused, you are not thinking clearly.
Just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed.
Always be sincere, even when you don't mean it.
Ignorance is no excuse, it's the real thing.
To make crime unprofitable, let the government run it.
