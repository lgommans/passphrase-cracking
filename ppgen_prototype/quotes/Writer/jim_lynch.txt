Writer
As a writer, I'm driven by settings. Others are driven by characters or predicaments, but with me, settings come first.
I was a political reporter for quite some time, so I followed around all sorts of different politicians.
I do think that there are gray lines of morality in a newsroom, when it comes to some stories. The best-intentioned journalist still has a difficult mission, to try to boil down people.
