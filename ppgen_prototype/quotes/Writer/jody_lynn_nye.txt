'Granted' is about a lively young woman who does a fairy godmother a good turn and is given a wish as her reward.
I have written two books that have to do with fairy godmothers: 'The Magic Touch' and 'Wishing on a Star.'
I do just as much world-building in a short story as I do for a novel.
I agreed to go on a date with a nice young man who was a former student of my uncle, who taught music in high schools and colleges. The nice young man took me to a party at his sister's, where I met people who introduced me to virtually all the elements of my future.
