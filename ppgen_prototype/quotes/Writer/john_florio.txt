A good husband makes a good wife.
Night is the mother of thoughts.
Praise the sea, on shore remain.
Patience is the best medicine.
Who has not served cannot command.
England is the paradise of women, the purgatory of men, and the hell of horses.
Who will not suffer labor in this world, let him not be born.
Wisdom sails with wind and time.
