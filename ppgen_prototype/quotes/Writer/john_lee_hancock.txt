I think that all the anger and cynicism comes from suppressing things that we always wanted.
Someone is going to win and someone is going to lose. That's also what happens in almost every movie - someone is going to win and someone is going to lose.
Somebody might say that they always wanted to be a fly-fishing guide in Montana and maybe they'll never get to do that but just by the virtue of having said it out loud, I think there's some power in that.
You set out to tell a good story. You don't do it because there is a deep message involved because the movie is almost always bad when you do that.
A good deed is a good deed.
