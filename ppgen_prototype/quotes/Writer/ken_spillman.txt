Making reading an enjoyable activity for children is a challenge. So I ensure that I write in a way that is fun for children to read.

Interacting with Indian children was so fulfilling. They are so affectionate. Every school I've visited, I've been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and love they've showered me with!
