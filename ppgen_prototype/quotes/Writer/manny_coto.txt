I started off as a 'Star Trek' fan, and to be able to work on the series was a great honor.
Remember that the fans want to hear inside stuff about the series; they don't want to hear gripes and grouses about your personal life. What they really want to hear is how the series gets made, and how you interact with your fellow cast members.
I would wait in line for anything to do with 'Doctor Who.'
My fantasy is, if I wasn't on 'Dexter,' I would move my family to London and work for the BBC on 'Doctor Who.'
