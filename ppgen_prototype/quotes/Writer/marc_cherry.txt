American,Writer
Yes, we're trying some new stuff. Some of it might work. Some of it might not. This, of course, is the nature of episodic television. They can't all be gems.
A lot of the women I know, that's what they're complaining about - either the man in their life or the lack of a man in their life.
I love the idea of a beautiful neighborhood that represents the very best of American values, but also as a fun backdrop to some darker, deliciously sneaky things going on in people's lives.
I vigorously deny hitting Ms. Sheridan.
I've got a contract that keeps me around a few more years.
I'm excited and terrified to write something new. I won't be writing about suburbia.
There are certain storylines I shouldn't have done, there are certain actors I shouldn't have cast - guest stars, I mean.
I got to have a TV show that really was the talk of the nation for a while there. So I'm a very lucky guy.
There's no one I trust in show business more than Sabrina Wind. She's my eyes and ears when I can't be there. She weighs in on everything, from scripts to sets to advertising.
