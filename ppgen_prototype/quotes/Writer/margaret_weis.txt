Hope is the denial of reality.
All the characters and plots were predetermined. Games make bad plots.
In Endless Quest books, you start the plot, and the character has to make choices. Then you have to write one choice over here, one choice over there. The author might get one or two choices out.
I like working closely with artists. I think that's very important in fantasy and science fiction - the visual aspect of the worlds and the characters.
The only cartoon I ever liked was 'Fantasia.'
