I have found things that I could have done better in 'The Woman Warrior.' But then I thought: Let the work of one's youth just stand.
I learned to make my mind large, as the universe is large, so that there is room for contradictions.
When I'm teaching, I tell my students: It's all process. Don't even think of product.
The sweat of hard work is not to be displayed. It is much more graceful to appear favored by the gods.
To me success means effectiveness in the world, that I am able to carry my ideas and values into the world - that I am able to change it in positive ways.
The difference between mad people and sane people... is that sane people have variety when they talk-story. Mad people have only one story that they talk over and over.
Hunger also changes the world - when eating can't be a habit, then neither can seeing.
I've been writing since I was 7, but before that, I was orally making stories.
It seems that writing chose me. I feel that because I know history, and I know the history of so many cultures; I have lived a large life.
I'm so proud that my offspring became a musician. I'm full of awe that we are able to have a whole family live the life of artists.
What does old look like? Sometimes I am wrinkled, sometimes not.
Let my life as Poet begin. I want the life of the Poet. I have labored for over twelve years, one thousand pages of prose. Now, I want the easiness of poetry. The brevity of the poem.
There can't be a pure myth, especially when the myth has been handed down in the oral tradition. As the stories are told, they change. If the stories don't change they just die.
When I am composing, I try to clear my mind of having to publish, or having to sell a book or find readers. That kind of thinking gets in the way.
