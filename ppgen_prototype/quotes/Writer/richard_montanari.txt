I was raised Catholic at a time when Vatican II was just taking hold.
Philly is a city made up of many neighborhoods - more than a hundred, in fact - and the citizens can be very territorial.
Believe me, although I really like the show, the reality of Philly Homicide is nothing like CBS's 'Cold Case.'
I've always been fascinated by accounts of seemingly 'normal' people who have committed horrendous acts of cruelty and violence. You hear it on the news all the time.
