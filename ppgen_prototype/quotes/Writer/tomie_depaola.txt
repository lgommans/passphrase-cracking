A picture book is a small door to the enormous world of the visual arts, and they're often the first art a young person sees.
I remember feeling guilty that I had a good childhood. I thought everybody who is famous has to have a desperate childhood and work his way out of it, but I had a great one.
I try to be as clear and simple as I can be in my illustrations so that the child can tell what is going on and what the emotions are.
