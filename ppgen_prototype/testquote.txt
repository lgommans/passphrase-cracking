American,Artist
Now almost every artist outside of New York is connected with some school or some museum school, and even in New York the majority are. That's an interesting fact when you take the idea of making money, making a living selling paintings. Only a dozen or two painters do that.
The job at Brooklyn is interesting because Brooklyn reflects what happened to university art departments everywhere. It might be the worst department now, and yet at one point it was the best in the country.
investment is in health and education.
I still say, 'Shoot for the moon; you might get there.'
Going to Mars would evolve humankind into a two-planet species.
I'm sure that there are places in the deserts in Australia that could be similar to where we might want to go on Mars.
Timing has always been a key element in my life. I have been blessed to have been in the right place at the right time.
A family needs to work as a team, supporting each other's individual aims and aspirations.
My favourite thing to do on this planet is to scuba dive.
Nobody cares about the bronze or silver medals.
The pilgrims on the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock. To my knowledge, they didn't wait around for a return trip to Europe. You settle some place with a purpose. If you don't want to do that, stay home. You avoid an awful lot of risks by not venturing outward.
Some things just can't be described. And stepping onto the moon was one of them.
Fighter pilots have ice in their veins. They don't have emotions. They think, anticipate. They know that fear and other concerns cloud your mind from what's going on and what you should be involved in.
Globalisation means many other countries are asserting themselves and trying to take over leadership. Please don't ask Americans to let others assume the leadership of human exploration. We can do wonderful science on the Moon, and wonderful commercial things. Then we can pack up and move on to Mars.
What are you going to do with astronauts who first reach the surface of Mars and then turn around and rocket back home-ward? What are they going to do, write their memoirs? Would they go again? Having them repeat the voyage, in my view, is dim-witted. Why don't they stay there on Mars?
By refocusing our space program on Mars for America's future, we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969. We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface.
When you're in a spacecraft, you need to know what things you can touch and what things you shouldn't touch!
I inherited depression from my mother's side of the family.
I've been to the Titanic in a yellow submarine and the North Pole in a Russian nuclear ice breaker.
I have no intention of selling any more of the historical Apollo 11 items in my possession for the remainder of my life. I intend to pass a portion of these items on to my children and to loan the most important items for permanent display in suitable museums around the country.
I feel we need to remind the world about the Apollo missions and that we can still do impossible things.
For the future, primarily, we must educate people in science, engineering, technology and math.
The best way to study Mars is with two hands, eyes and ears of a geologist, first at a moon orbiting Mars... and then on the surface.
I want to keep on the move, keep stimulated and challenged.
Everyone who's been in space would, I'm sure, welcome the opportunity for a return to the exhilarating experiences there.
If you want poets in space, you'll have to wait.
Instead of planning the retirement of the Space Shuttle program, America should be preparing the shuttles for their next step in space: evolving, not shutting them down and laying off thousands of people.
A hybrid human-robot mission to investigate an asteroid affords a realistic opportunity to demonstrate new technological capabilities for future deep-space travel and to test spacecraft for long-duration spaceflight.
I grew up in New Jersey and never went up the Statue of Liberty.
I realize that my life is not the common ordinary person.
I want to reach a new generation. That's why I am Twittering now. I have a BlackBerry, an iPhone and a Mac.
Being first outside the spacecraft would bring much more responsibility, and I really wasn't looking for that.
There's no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It's no longer there. We're descending rather rapidly.
We should've asked China to be a portion of the space station. We should've worked out ways that we can... just give away the technology that we have that puts things up into space, with cooperation up above the atmosphere that's needed to help each other.
Nobody ever asks who was the seventh person on the Moon. The only thing they know is who's number one and who's number two. Does anybody know who the last man was?
I'm convinced that sending people to Mars is so expensive that if you go once and bring the people back and then go again and bring the people back, we're eventually going to run out of money. But what if we send people the first time and they don't come back? What if they stay there?
When you go to Mars, you need to have made the decision that you're there permanently. The more people we have there, the more it can become a sustaining environment. Except for very rare exceptions, the people who go to Mars shouldn't be coming back. Once you get on the surface, you're there.
The guys who walk on Mars are going to be historic.
