Hey you, yeah you 
 Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot 
 Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not 
 Puts me down, fool me around

 Pours my beer, licks my ear 
 Brings out the devil in me 
 Hell ain't a bad place to be 
 Spends my money, drinks my booze 
 Stays out every night

 If this is hell, then you could say 
 It's heavenly 
 Hell ain't a bad place to be 
 Late in the night, turns down the light 
 Closes up on me 
 Opens my heart, tears me apart 
 Brings out the devil in me

 You can throw me lefts, you can throw me rights 
 But where was you last night 
 Beatin' around the bush 
 Wish I knew what was on your mind 
 Why you bein' so unkind 
 Remember those nights we spent alone 
 Talkin' on the telephone 
 Thoughts of you goin' through my brain 
 You told me that you felt the same 
 You said that you loved me too 
 But tell me who was there with you 
 I was talkin' birds, and you was talkin' bees 
 And was he down on his knees 
 Beatin' around the bush 
 You're the meanest woman I've ever known 
 Sticks and stones won't break my bones 
 I know what you're looking for 
 You've eaten your cake you want some more 
 I'm gonna give you just a one more chance 
 Try to save our romance 
 I've done everything I'm gonna do 
 The rest is up to you 
 And you can chew it up, you can spit it out 
 You can let it all hang out 
 Beatin' around the bush 
 And you can chew it up, you can spit it out 
 You can let it all hang out 
 Beatin' around the bushI'll take the high road 
 And you'll take the low road 
 And I'll be in Scotland afore ye 
 But me and my true love 
 Will never meet again

 And if I had to take the oath I would take them all 
 Give me that ruff stuff

 She's a woman, she's a winner 
 In every way, way, way 
 She don't want love 
 No cabaret, that's out 
 She like to play around 
 That suits me fine

 They keep me out of touch 
 They lock me in

 Sweet apple pie 
 Standing in the street 
 Hands outta line 
 Looking for some meat (heat?) 
 She take you high 
 When you feel her sting 
 She make you fly 
 And you know you're coming 
 Who all need it - who 
 Who all need it - you

 At everything she meet

 She kept her motor clean 
 She was the best damn woman 
 That I ever seen 
 She had the sightless eyes 
 Telling me no lies 
 And knocking me out 
 With those American thighs 
 Taking more than her share 
 Had me fighting for air 
 She told me to come 
 But I was already there 
 'Cause the walls started shaking 
 The earth was quaking 
 My mind was aching 
 And we were making it 
 And you 
 Shook me all night long 
 Yeah, you 
 Shook me all night long 
 Working double time 
 On the seduction line 
 She was one of a kind 
 She's just mine all mine 
 Wanted no applause 
 Just another course 
 Made a meal out of me 
 And come back for more 
 Had to cool me down 
 To take another round 
 Now I'm back in the ring 
 To take another swing 
 That the walls were shaking 
 The earth was quaking 
 My mind was aching 
 And we were making it 
 And you 
 Shook me all night long 
 Yeah, you 
 Shook me all night long 
 And knocked me out, I said, you 
 Shook me all night long 
 You had me shaking and you 
 Shook me all night long

 When you took me 
 You really took me and you 
 Shook me all night long

 All night longI never smoked me no cigarettes 
 I never drank much booze 
 But I'm only a man doncha understand 
 A man can sometimes lose 
 You gave me somethin' I never had 
 Pulled me down with you 
 Hit me up with a big hunka love 
 Hope you can pull me through 
 I overdosed on you 
 I overdosed on you 
 Crazy but it's true 
 Ain't nothin' I can do 
 I overdosed on you 
 Oh, woman you give to me 
 More than I can take 
 But listen honey, I don't mind 
 You're a habit I don't wanna break 
 Don't want me none of that harder stuff 
 Don't need it anymore 
 I'm in hell and I'm sinkin' fast 
 And I don't need no cure 
 I overdosed on you 
 I overdosed on you 
 Crazy but it's true 
 Ain't nothin' I can do 
 I overdosed on you 
 I was as happy as a man can be 
 Too far gone to save 
 Died of love and plenty of 
 Just write on my grave 
 I overdosed on you

 Crazy but it's true 
 There's nothin' I can do

 Want some of that stuff, 'cause I like a hot touch 
 Wanna little squeezing, just a touch and teasing 
 Maybe wrong, maybe right, but I like it every night

 Thirst blood, a need in disguise

 Cheap blondes and bums and barmaids on a midnight drift 
 And the dance band's playing the same old slam 
 I'm sinking whiskey and you're sipping fine wine 
 I don't know what it is you're trying to prove 
 Well it should be you but it's me who can hardly move 
 And I've got my reputation lying on the line 
 Come on baby, be a good dog and help the blind 
 Oh, won't you carry me home 
 Won't you carry me home 
 Won't you carry me home 
 Like a truck, pick me up 
 You ain't no lady but you've sure got taste in men 
 That head of yours has got you by time and time again 
 My arms and legs are aching and my head's about to blow 
 And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show 
 But I've just spent next weeks wages and I'm right out of coin 
 But you want more and it's half past four and they want to close the joint 
 But we can't afford a taxi and it's too late for the bus 
 But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust 
 Carry me home 
 Oh, won't you carry me home 
 Won't you carry me home 
 Don't let me lie here in all this beer 
 You drank all your booze and half of mine 
 I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine to come and kill me 
 Just like the man who threw me on the floor 
 Don't matter, while I'm down here I might as well try and find the fucking door 
 Excuse me, have you seen it? It's about this big 
 And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick 
 I'm dead drunk and heave'n, hanging upside down 
 And you're getting up and leaving, you think I'm gonna drown 
 Carry me home 
 Oh, won't you carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Oh, won't you carry me home 
 Oh, carry me homeLivin' easy

 Down to my last dime 
 I ain't got the sense to leave 
 The dealers cutting fine 
 Last throw 
 Back against the wall 
 Depending where the money is 
 Is where I'm gonna fall 
 Ace high 
 Hide your poker eyes 
 I didn't wanna laugh too much 
 When I picked up the prize 
 Lady luck 
 Standing at my side 
 I leave with more than I brought in 
 And get out with my life 
 Get out with my life

 Then you see two animals just foolin' you around 
 Stray dogs 
 Gonna take them in 
 Don't know what your names are 
 Where you're goin' and where ya been 
 All day it's difficult to say 
 Who was doing what to who, who's callin' out the play

 Tonight I'm gonna kick up 
 Out drivin' in a big truck 
 An' maybe I'll get beat up 
 Caught with your pants down 
 Lining up for a roll call 
 Goin' out with a big bang 
 Gettin' caught in a shootout 
 Take it hard like a big man 
 Woman workin' so hot 
 Givin' it everything you got 
 Just like it's never gonna stop 
 Tonight I'm gonna kick up 
 Out drivin' in a big truck 
 An' maybe I'll get beat up

 Maybe those folks might of got it right 
 And some people say I drive a Cadillac car 
 Or sell my wares hauntin' hotel bars

 Like talking sex to women, girls in fast cars

 Could be a quake any day 
 Maybe somebody from Siam 
 Begin the era of a new rage 
 Keeps lickin' all the honey 
 Chewin' up the fat he rakes 
 Instead of sending to the lions 
 They cover him with praise 
 All hail Caesar, hail, hail! 
 All hail Caesar, hail, hail! 
 Down at the epicenter 
 Things started heatin' up 
 Rockin' on the Richter scale 
 Swinging in the chariot 
 Around and around we go 
 The senators rehearse the tale 
 Starring in the coliseum 
 Tied upon the rack 
 Up comes the thumb of Cesar 
 To stab you in the back 
 All hail Caesar, hail, hail! 
 All hail Caesar, hail, hail! 
 Down at the epicenter 
 Things started heatin' up 
 Rockin' on the Richter scale 
 Swingin' in the chariot 
 Around and around we go

 And the law got the drop on meThe following is a true story 
 Only the names have been changed 
 To protect the guilty - 
 Well I left my job in my home town 
 And I headed for the smoke 
 Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand 
 Gonna get to the top 
 Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing 
 So if you've got the money, we've got the sound 
 You put it up and we'll put it down 
 If you got the dollar, we got the song 
 Just wanna boogie woogie all night long 
 Yeah boogie 
 I got holes in my shoes 
 I got holes in my teeth 
 I got holes in my socks 
 I can't get no sleep 
 I'm trying to make a million 
 And I got patches on the patches 
 On my old blue jeans 
 Well they used to be blue 
 When they used to be new 
 When they used to be clean 
 But I've got a Momma whose a hummer (and I've gota mama, whose a hummer) 
 Whose keeping me alive ((just) keepin' me alive) 
 While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys (while I'mdoin' drinkin' 
 She's working 9 to 5 (with the boys) 
 (She) knows her place that woman 
 Just you wait - 
 One of these days see me driving round town 
 In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down 
 My bottle of booze 
 No summer time blues 
 Shouting out, "Look at me" 
 In my rock 'n' roll voice 
 Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire 
 "Hey hello Howard, how you doin', my next door neighbour?" 
 "Oh yeah... Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport"Two faced woman with the two faced lies 
 I hope your two faced living made you satisfied 
 Tell me baby I was your only one 
 While you've been running around town with every mother's son 
 Told your story about the women like you 
 Told your story about the things you do 
 I used to think that you were sugar and spice 
 I should've listened to my mother's advice 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Ain't this misery ever gonna end? 
 And I've been kicked in the teeth 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Two faced woman, such a crying shame 
 Don't know nothing, you're all the same 
 You run around, hope you had your fun 
 You never know who's gonna win till the race been run 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Ain't this misery ever gonna end? 
 And I've been kicked in the teeth 
 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Two faced woman, such a crying shame 
 Don't know nothing, you're all the same 
 You run around, hope you had your fun 
 You never know who's gonna win till the race been runNo mercy for the bad if they want it 
 No mercy for the bad if they plead 
 No mercy for the bad if they need it 
 Ooh, no mercy from me 
 Tell no truth an' tell no lies 
 Cross your heart and hope to die 
 Never give what you can't take back 
 Scratch like a cat 
 If you inject your venom 
 It'll be your last attack 
 No mercy for the bad if they want it 
 No mercy for the bad if they plead 
 No mercy for the bad if they need it 
 V. E. N. O. M. 
 Got no heart, no, feel no pain 
 Take your soul and leave a stain 
 Come choose your victim

 And there's a full moon in the sky 
 You hear a dog bark in the distance 
 You hear someone's baby cry 
 A rat runs down the alley 
 And a chill runs down your spine 
 And someone walks across a grave 
 And you wish the sun would shine 
 'Cause no one's gonna warn ya 
 And no one's gonna yell "Attack" 
 And you don't feel the steel 
 Till it's hanging out your back

 When you turn off the light 
 Too scared to turn your light out 
 'Cause there's something on your mind 
 Was there a noise outside the window? 
 What's that shadow on the blind? 
 As you lie there naked 
 Like a body in a tomb 
 Suspended animation 
 As I slip into your room

 Which goes something like the following: 
 I'll take the high road 
 And you'll take the low road 
 And I'll be in Scotland afore ye 
 But me and my true love 
 Will never meet again 
 On the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond 
 Here is the complete song... 
 By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes, 
 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon'. 
 Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae 
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'. 
 O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road, 
 An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye; 
 But me and my true love will never meet again 
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'. 
 'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen, 
 On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon', 
 Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view, 
 An' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'. 
 O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road, 
 An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye; 
 But me and my true love will never meet again 
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.My Daddy was workin' nine to five 
 When my Momma was havin' me 
 By the time I was half alive 
 They knew what I was gonna be 
 But I left school and grew my hair 
 They didn't understand 
 They wanted me to be respected as 
 A doctor or a lawyer man 
 (But I had other plans) 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer 
 I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, 
 A rock 'n' roll star 
 Well I worked real hard and bought myself 
 A rock 'n' roll guitar 
 I gotta be on top some day 
 I wanna be a star 
 I can see my name in lights 
 And I can see the queue 
 I got the devil in my blood 
 Tellin' me what to do 
 (And I'm all ears) 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star 
 Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer 
 I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, 
 A rock 'n' roll star 
 (I hear it pays well) 
 Well you can stick your nine to five livin' 
 And your collar and your tie 
 You can stick your moral standards 
 'Cause it's all a dirty lie 
 You can stick your golden handshake

 Face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one 
 Feeling running down your spine 
 Nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you 
 Through and through 
 The databank knows my number 
 Says I gotta pay 'cause I made the grade last year

 Kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do 
 Do to you

 Who made who, ain't nobody told you? 
 Who made who, who made you? 
 If you made them and they made you 
 Who picked up the bill, who? And who made who? 
 Who made who, who turned the screw? 
 Satellites send me picture 
 Get it in the eye, take it to the world (take it to the wire) 
 Spinning like a dynamo 
 Feel it going round and round 
 Running out of chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town 
 So don't look down, no 
 Who made who, who made you? 
 Who made who, ain't nobody told you?

 There was nothing that she wouldn't do 
 It wasn't the first, wasn't the last 
 She knew we was making love

 Like a hand in a velvet glove 
 Seems like a touch, a touch too much 
 Seems like a touch, a touch too much 
 Too much for my body, too much for my brain 
 This damn woman's gonna drive me insane 
 She's got a touch, a touch too much 
 She had the face of an angel, smiling with sin 
 The body of Venus with arms 
 Dealin' with danger, strokin' my skin 
 Like a thunder and lightening storm 
 It wasn't the first, wasn't the last 
 It wasn't that she didn't care 
 She wanted it hard, wanted it fast 
 She liked it done medium rare 
 Seems like a touch, a touch too much 
 Seems like a touch, a touch too much 
 Too much for my body, too much for my brain 
 This damn woman's gonna drive me insane 
 She has a touch, a touch too much 
 Touch me!

 Blinded on a bad trip 
 Yes and nothing's going to change it 
 No, I can't do nothing right 
 Can't even sleep at night 
 My feet have left the ground

 Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down 
 Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down 
 I'm spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down 
 Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling downDeep water all around me 
 And circle sharks all about 
 Deep in trouble, had me turned around 
 Man up and one man down 
 You pretty women gather 'round 
 You can't pick up not a single sound 
 You feel you're winning, that's what it's all about 
 Knowing when you're winning, oooh 
 And it could be the very last time 
 I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream 
 I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream 
 Circle sharks all about you 
 You come up and you don't know why 
 Where goes a woman with a warm embrace? 
 Does a man walk in the hard rain? 
 I'm amazed at the mess you found 
 Coming up and I'm standing next in line 
 Give into none and that one comes 
 Hear me hollerin' I get the most 
 I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream 
 I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream 
 I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream

 Want something for nothing

 Keep pushing and shoving 
 And I'm down on the game 
 Always in trouble 
 Forever detained 
 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 And good riddance to bad luck 
 Well spread out the news 
 There's a free man loose 
 Back out of jail 
 And chasing some flooze 
 Bad luck has changed 
 Broken the chains 
 Lay down a claim 
 For monetary gains 
 Wonder what's coming 
 Out for the take 
 Freedom for loving 
 And lust for the taste 
 Eyes are wide open 
 Wild to the game 
 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 And good riddance to bad luck 
 Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

 Runnin' with a gun, this place is gonna burn 
 No firewater, or novocaine 
 No thunderstorm, no John Wayne 
 No kids to rock, nowhere to run

 Burnin' alive, burnin' alive 
 They be smokin' your hide, come runnin' wild 
 Tell you nothin' to fear, cause the buck stops here 
 He came from a little town called Hope 
 And someday maybe, it'll go up in smoke 
 No firewater, or novocaine 
 No thunderstorm, no John Wayne 
 No kids to rock, nowhere to run 
 So watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn 
 Burnin' alive, burnin' alive

 God's gift to ballroom notoriety 
 And I always fill my ballrooms

 And some for fancy dress 
 But when they're held for pleasure 
 They're the balls that I like best 
 My balls are always bouncing

 Should be held every night

 Up in the morning and out to school 
 The teacher is teaching the golden rule 
 American history and practical math 
 You studyin' hard and you're hopin' to pass 
 Ooh you're working your fingers right down to the bone 
 And the guy behind you won't leave you alone 
 Ring ring goes the bell 
 The cook in the kitchen is ready to sell 
 But you're lucky if you can find a seat 
 You're fortunate if you got time to eat 
 Well back in the classroom open your books 
 Ooh the teacher don't know how mean she looks 
 Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll 
 Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll 
 Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roooooll 
 As soon as 3 o'clock goes around 
 You finally lay your burden down 
 Throw down your books and outta your seat 
 You go down the hallway into the street 
 And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been 
 You find a juke joint, you go in 
 You drop the coin right into the slot 
 You gotta hear something that's really hot, like me 
 With the one you love you're makin' romance 
 All day long they wanted to dance 
 And you're feeling the music from head to toe 
 As round and round and round you go 
 Get over here 
 Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll 
 Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll

 'Cause I'm back on the track 
 And I'm beatin' the flack 
 Nobody's gonna get me on another rap

 Out of sightWell I tied my baby to the railroad track 
 Cannonball down the line 
 Giving that woman just a one more chance 
 To give it to me one more time 
 Engineer wishing he was home in bed 
 Dreaming about Casey Jones 
 Wide-eyed woman lookin' a mile ahead 
 Thinking about broken bones 
 It's her love that I want 
 It's her love that I need 
 It's her love got to have 
 It's her love 
 Heavenly body flying across the sky 
 Superman was out of town 
 Come on honey, gotta change your tune 
 'Cause it's a long way down 
 Clark Kent looking for a free ride 
 Thinking about Lois Lane 
 It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide 
 And that'd be a shame 
 It's her love that I want 
 It's her love that I need 
 It's her love got to have 
 It's her love 
 Long Arm looking for a fingerprint 
 Trying to find the mystery clue 
 Hitting me with the third degree 
 Working on a thumb screw 
 All right, officer, I confess 
 Everything's coming back 
 I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine 
 It was a heart attack 
 It's her love that I want 
 It's her love that I need 
 It's her love got to have 
 It's her love 
 What's next to the moon?I'm hot, and when I'm not 
 I'm cold as ice 
 Get out of my way, just step aside 
 Or pay the price 
 What I want I take, what I don't I break 
 And I don't want you 
 With a flick of my knife, I can change your life 
 There's nothing you can do 
 I'm a problem child 
 Problem child 
 I'm a problem child 
 Feel like running wild 
 Make my stand, no man's land 
 On my own 
 Man in blue, it's up to you 
 The seed is sown 
 What I want I stash, what I don't I smash 
 And you're on my list 
 Dead or alive, I got a .45 
 And I never miss 
 I'm a problem child 
 Problem child 
 I'm a problem child 
 Just feel like running wild 
 Every night, street light 
 I drink my booze 
 Some run, some fight 
 But I win they lose 
 What I need I like, what I don't I fight 
 And I don't like you 
 Yeah, say bye-bye while you're still alive 
 Your time is through 
 'Cause I'm a problem child 
 I'm a problem child

 When I think of you saying goodbye 
 Oh the sky turns to a deeper blue 
 That's, that's how I'd feel if I lost you 
 Jean, Oh Jean 
 Don't go and leave me 
 'Cause I love, I love you, I love you, don't leave me

 The kind of woman that brings on heat 
 Loved her dusk till dawn

 Keep on rocking all through the night 
 Ooh there she goes, she goes 
 And nobody knows where she goes, she goes 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 A heavy rocking tune is playing 
 Playing as the night rolls on 
 Sneaking off with the Romeo 
 Where she goes, nobody knows 
 A heavy rocking tune is playing 
 On a flat screen colour TV 
 Sneaking over creepy crawly 
 Never give it up to take it out through the night 
 There she goes she goes, and nobody knows

 Back in 1955 
 Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show 
 And all that jive 
 The white man had the schmaltz 
 The black man had the blues 
 No one knew what they was gonna do 
 But Tchaikovsky had the news, he said 
 Let there be sound, and there was sound 
 Let there be light, and there was light 
 Let there be drums, there was drums 
 Let there be guitar, there was guitar 
 Let there be rock 
 And it came to pass 
 That rock 'n' roll was born 
 All across the land every rockin' band 
 Was blowin' up a storm 
 And the guitar man got famous 
 The business man got rich 
 And in every bar there was a superstar 
 With a seven year itch 
 There was fifteen million fingers 
 Learnin' how to play 
 And you could hear the fingers pickin' 
 And this is what they had to say 
 Let there be light, sound, drums, guitar 
 Oh, let there be rock 
 One night in a club called the Shakin' Hand 
 There was a 42 decibel rockin' band 
 And the music was good and the music was loud 
 And the singer turned and he said to the crowd: 
 "Let there be rock"Idle juvenile on the street, on the street

 Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law 
 Don't kick, don't fight, don't sleep at night

 Shake it down 
 Keeping out of trouble 
 With eyes in the back of my face 
 Kicking ass in the class

 Underneath that old apple tree 
 Sitting with a handful of flowers 
 Looking as cool as can be 
 We talked away a couple of hours 
 Then she laid her hand on my lap 
 Oh, I thought I got to be dreaming 
 I didn't know I fell in her trap 
 Then she made me say things I didn't want to say 
 Then she made me play games I didn't want to play 
 She was a soul stripper, yeah 
 She took my heart 
 She was a soul stripper, ooh 
 And tore me apart 
 She started moving nice and easy 
 Slowly getting near to my spine 
 Killing off each last little feeling 
 Ooh, everyone she could find 
 And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah 
 That's when she put me down 
 Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me 
 Stuck it in and turned it around

 What my lady she's got 
 She steals the spotlight 
 Knocks me off my feet 
 She's enough to start a landslide 
 Just a walkin' down the street 
 Wearing dresses so tight 
 And looking dynamite 
 Enough to blow me out 
 No doubt about it can't live without it 
 The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)

 She really satisfies me 
 Love me till I'm legless 
 Aching and sore 
 Enough to stop a freight train 
 Or start the Third World War 
 You know I'm losin' sleep

 In another lonely town 
 But I ain't too young to worry 
 And I ain't too old to cry 
 When a woman gets me down 
 Got another empty bottle 
 And another empty bed 
 Ain't too young to admit it 
 No, I'm not too old to lie 
 I'm just another empty head 
 That's why I'm lonely 
 I'm so lonely 
 But I know what I'm gonna do 
 I'm gonna ride on 
 (Ride on) 
 (Ride on) Standing on the edge of the road 
 (Ride on) Thumb in the air 
 (Ride on) One of these days I'm gonna 
 (Ride on) Change my evil ways 
 Till then I'll just keep riding on 
 Broke another promise 
 Now I broke another heart 
 But I ain't too young to realize 
 That I ain't too old to try 
 Try to get back to the start 
 And it's another red light nightmare 
 Ooh, another red light street 
 And I ain't too old to hurry 
 'Cause I ain't too old to die 
 But I sure am hard to beat 
 But I'm lonely 
 Lord I'm lonely 
 What am I gonna do?

 Washed up on the shore 
 Bombed outta the city 
 Out of the door 
 Blown up against the wall
