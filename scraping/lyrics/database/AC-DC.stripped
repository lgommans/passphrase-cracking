 While youve been running around town with every mothers son 
 Told your story about the women like you 
 Told your story about the things you do 
 I used to think that you were sugar and spice

 Kicked in the teeth again 
 Sometimes you lose sometimes you win

 Scratch like a cat 
 If you inject your venom 
 Itll be your last attack 
 No mercy for the bad if they want it

 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon 
 Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae 
 On the bonnie bonnie banks o Loch Lomon 
 O yell tak the high road and Ill tak the low road 
 An Ill be in Scotland afore ye 
 But me and my true love will never meet again

 On the steep steep side o Ben Lomon 
 Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view 
 An the moon comin out in the gloamin

 Back in 1955 
 Man didnt know bout a rock n roll show 
 And all that jive 
 The white man had the schmaltz 
 The black man had the blues 
 No one knew what they was gonna do 
 But Tchaikovsky had the news he said 
 Let there be sound and there was sound 
 Let there be light and there was light 
 Let there be drums there was drums 
 Let there be guitar there was guitar 
 Let there be rock 
 And it came to pass 
 That rock n roll was born 
 All across the land every rockin band 
 Was blowin up a storm 
 And the guitar man got famous 
 The business man got rich 
 And in every bar there was a superstar 
 With a seven year itch 
 There was fifteen million fingers 
 Learnin how to play 
 And you could hear the fingers pickin 
 And this is what they had to say 
 Let there be light sound drums guitar 
 Oh let there be rock 
 One night in a club called the Shakin Hand 
 There was a 42 decibel rockin band 
 And the music was good and the music was loud 
 And the singer turned and he said to the crowd

 Slowly getting near to my spine 
 Killing off each last little feeling 
 Ooh everyone she could find

 Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me 
 Stuck it in and turned it around

 Ill take the high road 
 On the bonny bonny banks of Loch Lomond 
 Here is the complete song 
 By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes 
 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon 
 Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae 
 On the bonnie bonnie banks o Loch Lomon 
 O yell tak the high road and Ill tak the low road 
 An Ill be in Scotland afore ye 
 But me and my true love will never meet again 
 Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen 
 On the steep steep side o Ben Lomon 
 Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view 
 An the moon comin out in the gloamin 
 On the bonnie bonnie banks o Loch LomonMy Daddy was workin nine to five 
 When my Momma was havin me 
 By the time I was half alive 
 They knew what I was gonna be 
 But I left school and grew my hair 
 They didnt understand 
 They wanted me to be respected as 
 A doctor or a lawyer man 
 But I had other plans 
 Gonna be a rock n roll singer 
 Gonna be a rock n roll star 
 Im gonna be a rock n roll 
 A rock n roll star 
 Well I worked real hard and bought myself 
 A rock n roll guitar

 Tellin me what to do 
 And Im all ears 
 I hear it pays well 
 Well you can stick your nine to five livin 
 And your collar and your tie 
 You can stick your moral standards 
 Cause its all a dirty lie 
 You can stick your golden handshake 
 And you can stick your silly rules

 Cause I aint no fool

 Man didnt know bout a rock n roll show 
 And all that jive 
 The white man had the schmaltz 
 The black man had the blues 
 No one knew what they was gonna do 
 But Tchaikovsky had the news he said 
 Let there be sound and there was sound 
 Let there be light and there was light 
 Let there be drums there was drums 
 Let there be guitar there was guitar 
 Let there be rock 
 And it came to pass 
 That rock n roll was born 
 All across the land every rockin band 
 Was blowin up a storm 
 And the guitar man got famous 
 The business man got rich 
 And in every bar there was a superstar 
 With a seven year itch 
 There was fifteen million fingers 
 Learnin how to play 
 And you could hear the fingers pickin 
 And this is what they had to say 
 Let there be light sound drums guitar 
 Oh let there be rock 
 One night in a club called the Shakin Hand 
 There was a 42 decibel rockin band 
 And the music was good and the music was loud 
 And the singer turned and he said to the crowd 
 Let there be rockIdle juvenile on the street on the street

 Fightin on the wrong side of the law of the law 
 Dont kick dont fight dont sleep at night 
 And shake a leg 
 Shake a leg

 Underneath that old apple tree 
 Sitting with a handful of flowers 
 Looking as cool as can be 
 We talked away a couple of hours 
 Then she laid her hand on my lap

 Then she made me play games I didnt want to play 
 She was a soul stripper yeah 
 She took my heart

 And tore me apart 
 She started moving nice and easy 
 Slowly getting near to my spine 
 Killing off each last little feeling 
 Ooh everyone she could find 
 And when she had me hollow and naked yeah 
 Thats when she put me down 
 Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me 
 Stuck it in and turned it around 
 Then she made me say things I didnt want to say you know
