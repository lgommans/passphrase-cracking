Look at you how far you came 
 Here from where it all started 
 You haven't changed, you stayed the same 
 So strong and brave-hearted 
 And you would never ask for more 
 You make a difference in peoples' lives 
 I have said it all before 
 So many other times 
 I'm sure your daddy would be proud of you 
 If he could see the good things that you do 
 You're just like twins, so much alike 
 I'm sure he would have loved you 
 Each and every day he would have made sure 
 That you would feel safe and be alright 
 In spite of pain and broken hearts 
 And all the weight on your shoulders 
 You'll survive just where you are 
 Even when it gets colder 
 Regardless of your longtime fears 
 You have the power to soothe your soul 
 The way you smile behind your tears 
 I wish he could see it all 
 I'm sure your daddy would be proud of you 
 If he could see the good things that you do 
 Just like twins, so much alike 
 I'm sure he just would have loved you 
 Each and every day he would have made sure 
 That you would feel safe and be alright 
 And he would tell you 
 Always be proud of who you are 
 Don't let anyone put you down 
 Happy I always, I'm going to heaven 
 But just remember, remember, remember 
 I'm sure my daddy would be proud of you 
 If he could see the good things that you do 
 Just remember, remember, remember 
 I'm sure my daddy would be proud of you 
 If he would see the good things that you doRrrrrraaawwrr

 No time to spare 
 Turn left turn right step on it 
 Stopped by the traffic light 
 And all that honking screaming 
 The cabdriver is dreaming 
 Of the beach and babes 
 Leaning back easy as the sun goes down 
 But I'm already late 
 No time to spare 
 Couldn't care less about it 
 If the sky was falling down 
 No I don't care you can stare 
 While the whole world is crumbling around me 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 So you've got a lot of stuff on your mind 
 Or a bleeding heart when nobody cares 
 Step in, step out of the rain 
 Head for the flickering lights, just head for the flickering lights 
 There's always somebody dancing, baby, taking a chance 
 You can find a little romance, someone will give you love 
 Although it's just enough 
 To get you through the night 
 Well alright now 
 No I don't care you can stare 
 I don't care about it 
 No I don't care you can stare 
 I don't care about it 
 No I don't care you can stare 
 While the whole world is crumbling around me 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking us down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking me down 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking me down 
 Urban solitudeI might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well cheating on you 
 I always knew that you would be 
 Cheating on me finally 
 I never knew it be this soon 
 I didn't see it comin' 
 Yesterday you let me down 
 The only friend I thought I found 
 Sleepless nights, heart in two 
 Baby who was kissing you 
 If this would have happened to me 
 Ten years ago 
 I'd make sure that you'd be lying 
 Six feet underground 
 But little girls we grow up 
 Knowing love will find a way 
 So now we have an understanding 
 I can't see why I 
 Might as well 
 Be cheating on you 
 I might as well 
 Do all the things you do 
 I might as well 
 Have a little fun 
 Baby you inspire 
 It's the way we carry on 
 Heavy steal is all you see 
 That is what is left to me 
 No remorse no dignity 
 Can we get any higher 
 To every other happy fool 
 Disloyalty will come for you 
 Lights go out on your own 
 So much for pretending 
 Now if this would have happened to me 
 Ten years ago 
 I'd make sure that you'd be lying 
 Six feet underground 
 But little girls we grow up 
 Knowing love will find a way 
 So now we have an understanding 
 Let's just rock and roll 
 I might as well 
 Be cheating on you 
 I might as well 
 Do all the things you do 
 I might as well 
 Have a little fun 
 Baby you inspire 
 It's the way we carry on 
 Have you ever been in love before 
 And does it matter 
 'Cause nothing ever seems to be 
 The way it should be 
 Tell me why 
 Don't you love me like the 
 Way you used to do 
 It might be worthwhile 
 To take a step back and ask 
 Yourself how this is gonna last 
 When it's all a lie 
 Now here me out 
 I swear to God that this 
 Is something I will not forget 
 I might as well 
 Be cheating on you 
 I might as well 
 Do all the things you do 
 I might as well 
 Have a little fun 
 Baby you inspire 
 It's the way we carry on 
 Ye yeah! 
 Ye yeah 
 Ye yeah! 
 Oh ooh 
 I might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well be cheating on you I doThe black side of my mind is getting weaker 
 The black side of my soul is getting white 
 This time I'll try and dig a little deeper 
 So I can change the wrongs into what's right 
 Dark were the days when our life was gone 
 Those were the days when fear of death came along 
 Let us get rid of this 
 Dark were the nights when I did not fight 
 Those were the nights when dark told me what's right 
 I did it all for love 
 Why haven't I had enough? 
 Leave it alone because in time... 
 Walking away with nothing but 
 Pain in my heart for what we've lost 
 Try to stand tall with my head held high 
 The dark makes it hard for you to see 
 I gave it all for you and me 
 In time I will be ready to believe 
 Dark were the thoughts running through our minds 
 Those were the thoughts dragging me further down 
 What will you do for love? 
 When is it ever enough? 
 Leave it alone because in time...I don't exist for you 
 You made that crystal clear 
 Your sweetest thing for 7 years 
 What did I do to deserve this 
 Don't think you own my life 
 I've still got my pride 
 Trying so hard to forget 
 I cannot help but hear your voice 
 This is love, just trust me baby 
 Other girls mean nothing to me 
 Why don't you keep your big mouth shut 
 And all the bridges that you burn 
 Come back one day to haunt you 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Baby, don't get me wrong 
 If I'm not there to catch your fall 
 Did I try for too long 
 Am I to blame for you being you 
 Save those tears for someone else 
 Your trouble's only just begun 
 Hands off my sunshine leave it alone 
 Before I go commit a crime 
 I'm gonna show you what you taught me 
 No respect, no mercy 
 Till you fall down on your knees for me 
 All the bridges that you burn 
 Come back one day to haunt you 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Baby, don't get me wrong 
 If I'm not there to catch your fall 
 Did I try for too long 
 Am I to blame for you being youI don't want no trouble baby 
 I just wanted you to see 
 That I can get you much better love 
 I'll be that bitch she'll never be 
 I ain't no home-wrecker but you deserve that killer bee honey! 
 I'll give it up for anything but easy 
 Let me reply it's got to be me 
 You can't imagine what I am going through 
 And all those ladies stop and stare at you 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now let's get higher 
 Because I'm the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Walk down here baby 
 Leave it all up to me 
 While I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it you'll be begging me on your knees 
 'Cause I got the fire yeah! 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now come on and get it 
 When it comes to making love 
 Yeah I'm the one you're looking for 
 But don't you waste all of your time 
 Come over here before I'll change my mind 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now come on and get it 
 I'll take you higher 
 Yeah I am the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Walk down here baby 
 Leave it all up to me 
 'Cause I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it that you'll be begging me on your knees 
 Ooh yeah! 
 Walk down here baby 
 Leave it all up to me 
 I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it you'll be begging me on your knees 
 Higher, higher, higher! 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha 
 Come on and get it 
 Because I got the fire and you'd put it on me 
 I'm taking you higher 
 I'm readyNo hurry, I'll be waiting for you My baby 
 Now don't you worry 
 I'll be fine 
 Just take your time 
 To make up your mind 
 Draw a line 
 Or flip a dime 
 Waiting for you 
 It's easy 
 If you want to please me 
 Don't tell me maybe 
 Come back home complete me 
 No strings attached 
 That's a promise I can't keep 
 So I waste my time 
 With lazy crazy dreaming 
 A sparkling wine 
 A twist of lime 
 A whisky soda, hole in time 
 When you're not here 
 Don't say you're sorry 
 Don't say it 
 No 
 Don't say you're sorryCold blackhearted golddiggers 
 I guess that too much generosity 
 Is making people take you for a fool 
 And at every opportunity 
 They'll even try to get some more from you 
 So they'll cheat and lie 
 But I will let God deal with the things they do 
 'Cause when they get their hands on all that gold and paper 
 They forget to say thank you 
 But will money bring the things they want 
 And does it solve the problems that they face? 
 'Cause when everything is said and done 
 They will find out it's another day 
 Full of emptiness and lies 
 And they can grab as much as they can 
 But it will never buy them one seat in heaven 
 Oh, when money rules them 
 Let me tell you 
 Money's never bought me anything 
 I said nothing, no nothing at all 
 I said nothing, baby 
 I said nothing, baby 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing at allThe things you say 
 In your innocent way 
 Remind me how it should be 
 Your love I can trace 
 In a wide open space 
 Oh your beautiful face I have seen 
 It's the way you walk 
 And the way that you talk to me 
 You're God's gift to my world 
 The prettiest girl 
 And it feels like I live a dream 
 The silence I fear 
 Preach to the morning sun 
 So, just hold me now 
 I'll stay here all night 'cause I 
 Don't feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight, love 
 The things you do and say 
 Always go hand in hand 
 You're all you seem to be 
 Not a shred of you pretends 
 I will run like a fool 
 Just to be by your side 
 Don't hold back my love 
 You're my joy in this sad, sad world 
 You are safe with me 
 Dream and you will be free 
 So, just hold me now 
 I'll stay here all night 'cause I-I 
 Don't feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight love 
 Just hold me now 
 I'll stay here all night 'cause I-I 
 Don't feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight love 
 Holding me tight love 
 And if I could have it my way 
 I'd tell you to stay here always 
 I will be waiting for you 
 I'll be waiting and there's nothing else I can do 
 You've taken me over 
 Just hold me now 
 I'll stay here all night 'cause I-I 
 Don't feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight love 
 Holding me tight love 
 Holding me tight loveWhatever you say babe, 
 Don't you know 
 I'm not afraid because 
 I know just where to go 
 I'm loving you babe 
 All the time 
 I know that love will find a place for 
 You and I 
 I know I should have called you first 
 But I couldn't stop myself from driving to 
 You just to see 
 You smiling makes me wanna be with you 
 Is that all right? 
 Boy I just can't help myself 
 And that's the reason why 
 Whatever you say babe, 
 Don't you know 
 I'm not afraid because 
 I know just where to go 
 I'm loving you babe 
 All the time 
 I know that love will find a place for 
 You and I 
 Well 
 I'm driving in my car the music plays 
 The way you make me feel it's like 
 I'm walking on air 
 I'll make you believe again that lovers do stay 
 And every now and then we fight 
 Without walking away 
 Baby you just drive me crazy 
 Forget the world 
 For a while 
 Doesn't matter 
 Gotta have you 
 In my arms 
 That is were I'll stay 
 Whatever you say babe, 
 Don't you know 
 I'm not afraid because 
 I know just where to go 
 I'm loving you babe 
 All the time 
 I know that love will find a place for 
 You and I 
 Baby baby baby baby babyI love you baby 
 Who will I have to be 
 For you to be the one 
 So we can start a fire 
 Until the day comes? 
 I'll be waiting here 
 If it takes forever 
 I will look to see 
 What lies ahead of me 
 Oh baby, when I hear your voice 
 You're leaving me breathless 
 You're giving me no other choice 
 So baby, I'll just let you know, 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 Anywhere you wander 
 Anywhere you go 
 I promise I will stay 
 Boy, I love you so 
 There will be a time 
 When all the waiting's done 
 And doubts will disappear 
 They will be one by one 
 Oh baby, when I hear your voice 
 It's leaving me breathless 
 You're giving me no other choice 
 So baby, I just let you know, 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 Keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my heart for later 
 You and I 
 Do you feel me, baby? 
 Do you feel me, baby? 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 I'm keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 I'm keepin' my heart for later 
 Keepin' my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until it's you and I 
 Until it's you and I 
 Until it's you and II spy, I spy a tear in your eye 
 So I'll try, I'll try to get you out of here 
 You sigh, just move a little closer 
 Time flies, soon the night is over 
 Morning, noon, night, all day 
 All I ever wanted was for you to come my way 
 We've got time so let it slide 
 Roll me over get on top 
 Yes baby let's turn off the lights 
 And make an end to my lonely 
 I'm high, so high when you're with me 
 I might, I might stay all night 
 You, oh my, you're such a wild boy 
 Time flies, soon the night is over 
 Morning, noon, night, all day 
 All I ever wanted was for you to come my way 
 We've got time so let it slide 
 Roll me over get on top 
 Yes baby let's just lose our mind 
 And make an end to my 
 An end to my an end to my lonely 
 Welcome to the other side 
 An end to my an end to my 
 My lonely life 
 Welcome to the other sideWhat's the matter my friend 
 Can you tell me why 
 You say there's nothing on your mind 
 Please stop telling lies 
 As long as you're lying 
 I can't ease your mind 
 No sense in hiding 
 It's all in your eyes 
 No need to hide 
 Can't tell me lies 
 No sense in hiding 
 It's all in your eyes 
 'Cause I ain't happy man 
 Till I see you smile 
 Till I see the spark back in your eyes 
 And I can tell you why 
 As long as you're smiling 
 I'll hit a high 
 No sense in hiding 
 It's all in you eyes 
 No need to hide 
 You can't tell me lies 
 No sense in hiding 
 It's all in your eyes 
 What's the matter baby

 What's the matter now 
 'Cause I ain't happy Unless

 'Cause I ain't happy 
 Unless I see you smile 
 Unless I see you smileOh baby, please don't leave my heart 
 No, don't go away 
 Where would I go? I truly don't know 
 Where would I gather strength? 
 Words ain't enough, baby, for me to say 
 How much it'd kill me, though 
 I wouldn't be able to breathe anymore 
 If I would see you go 
 One of us ain't got no feelings 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out, yeah 
 You'd better not wipe us out today 
 I've been a cheater, a man eater 
 You knew I was no good 
 What can I say? I'm ready for change 
 Let that be understood 
 I want you to tell me I'm still in your heart 
 More than the day before 
 There's gotta be something that I can do 
 That'll make you love me more 
 One of us ain't got no feelings 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out, yeah 
 Better not wipe us out today 
 Once upon a dream, the memories meant nothing 
 And now they're all that I have left today 
 We started up as friends, thinking this would never end 
 But you had to throw it all away 
 All away! 
 Come on 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out, baby 
 Don't wipe us out, wipe us out 
 You'd better not wipe us out tod 
 Gotta be something, baby 
 Gotta, gotta be something I can do now 
 Hey now, baby 
 Don't you do that to usA taste of breath, a kiss sweater than honey 
 Your eyes in a misty dream a million miles away 
 And in my ear you whisper my name 
 Just like in some old news flash 
 From light years ago 
 Van Dyke's on the slide trombone 
 Through the smoke of the party room 
 Your teeth like the ivory coast 
 Start singin' my favourite song 
 And it happen' to be mood indigo 
 Mood indigo 
 I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 Could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Take off my make up 
 Holding on to my heart 
 Smokin' them downhill 
 In a room number thirteen 
 Tryin' to stretch my luck again 
 Down the corridor your footsteps echo against the wall 
 My man of mystery, my date with infinity 
 Tonight I'm gonna sacrifice, for the first time in my life 
 Make it all come back to me, like an old forgotten dream 
 Van Dyke's on the slide trombone 
 Through the smoke of the party room 
 Your teeth like the ivory coast 
 Start singin' my favourite song 
 And it happen' to be mood indigo 
 Mood indigo, I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 It could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Completely lost in my mood indigoGirl girl girl 
 When I hear him talk 
 Ooh my mind gets blocked girl 
 Speak up 'cause my jaw is locked 
 Which is good, good for me girl 
 It hides like a warning sign 
 But I'm too blind to see 
 Speak up, yes I'm coming down 
 With an ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever 
 Still got my hands they're clinging 
 So I just keep going 
 I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong to you 
 No I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Girl girl girl 
 Get it while it's hot they say 
 You see I'm burning up here 
 I want to but I just can't stop 
 And it hurts 
 It hurts like hell girl 
 You turn me inside out and upside down 
 Ooh you got me head over heels 
 I'm stuck, yes I'm coming down 
 With an ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever, aha 
 Still got my hands they're clinging 
 So I just keep going 
 I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong to you 
 No I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Still got my hands they're clinging 
 So I just keep going 
 I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong to you 
 No I don't know where I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Oh girl, yeah I belong 
 To you, you, you 
 To you, yeah you 
 To you, you, you 
 To you, yeah you 
 To you, you, you 
 Yeah I belong to you 
 Say you yeah you 
 Could I belong to you 
 Alright 
 Hey! 
 Hey!Yeah 
 Now I believe 
 That what I used to think 
 Was a lie 
 Is really a life 
 Now I can see 
 There's only one place to reach 
 Only one thing to preach 
 And that's the highest 
 It's the strangest thing 
 That I can feel so much 
 There is no reason 
 There is no logic to feelings 
 'Cause when love is the dealer I'm addicted 
 So fascinating 
 I can't stop this constant craving 
 You're contagious 
 It's the strangest thing 
 That I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 It's the strangest thing that 
 I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 And I cannot hide 
 Even if I try 
 You mean everything to me 
 Any fool can see 
 What you've done to me 
 You mean everything to me 
 And when you're not here 
 I just cry, hey hey 
 And when you're not here 
 I could die 
 Yet the best is still to come dear 
 Yet the best is still to come 
 For us 
 Yet the best is still to come dear 
 Oh, the best is still to come 
 It's the strangest thing 
 That I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 It's the strangest thing that 
 I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 And I cannot hide even if I try 
 You mean everything to me 
 Any fool can see what you've done to me 
 You mean everything to me 
 And when you're not here 
 I just cry 
 And when your're not here 
 I could die 
 I could die 
 I could die 
 I could die 
 And I cannot hide 
 Even if I try 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeahI'm gonna get out of my shell 
 Try without anybody's help 
 To lose this heavy load 
 And get my life back on the road 
 I've seen the worst when I was down 
 Only loneliness I found 
 Now I'm climbing to the top 
 And I ain't never gonna stop 
 I'll carry on, though the road is long 
 I'm gonna get myself together 
 And I'll hold on, 'cause I am strong 
 Gonna try to make it better, baby 
 The rest of my life I'll take these chances 
 Time goes by so very fast 
 I'll share my fortune and my failure 
 Till there's nothing left 
 And if somewhere down the line 
 I'll find I'm running out of time 
 I hope to god that I can say 
 I made the best of every day 
 Till then I'll carry on, 'though the road is long 
 I'm gonna get myself together 
 And I'll hold on, 'cause I am strong 
 I'm gonna try to make it better, baby 
 The rest of my life I'll take these chances 
 Time goes by so very fast 
 I'll share my fortune and my failure 
 Till there's nothing leftIt's a shame, the rules change not the game 
 Such a shame, It's the same 
 Now everything is in vain 
 All in vain, it's such a shame 
 Could it be true, that there's nothing left to do 
 For me and you, can't be true 
 We all can't be such fools 
 Could life be so cruel 
 Could life be so cruel 
 Maybe, I don't even try fearing what I'd find 
 Guess I am a number on the line 
 Could you please tell me why 
 We're on the same line, and we're fallin' behind 
 On life 
 Life is great, I'm walking in the sun and everything is cool 
 Yeah it's true, there's so much we can do 
 It feels so right 
 Yeah, it's all right 
 Maybe, I don't even try fearing what I'd find 
 Guess I am a number on the line 
 Could you please tell me why 
 Baby, I don't even wanna try fearing what I'd find 
 Guess I am a number on the line 
 Could you please tell me why we're on the same line and 
 Fallin' behind 
 Fallin' behind on lifeIt's funny how I blind myself 
 So I don't have to see 
 They're taking me down and bringing me to my knees 
 Letting me know I'm alone 
 Not afraid to die no more 
 The house above 
 Heaven won't you pick me up now 
 Love all I needed was love 
 Someone give me some love 
 I guess it's only meant for some of us 
 Life has made me lose my mind 
 I'm not doing all right these days 
 Lying naked on my kitchen floor 
 So cold, well I thought I had a lion's heart 
 I guess I was wrong 
 I feel so damn lonely 
 Love all I needed was some love 
 Could someone give me some sweet loving 
 'Cause this is more than I can bear 
 My nights are getting darker as time goes by, 
 How I've tried to keep these walls from falling down 
 One way or another they shut me downWe're breaking things we can't repair 
 None of us will take the blame 
 No nothing can be done this time 
 All the memories that we've made 
 I threw them all away 
 There's no need to talk it over 
 Don't let me get you down 
 Let's just move on 
 I am setting you free 
 'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more 
 I don't wanna make you go 
 Through one more rainy day 
 No I don't wanna hurt no more 
 Strange enough I always knew 
 I'm taking off today 
 Don't wanna hurt no more 
 The darkness you left in my soul 
 Do we know how much we've lost 
 Will the moon be shining as bright as before 
 And as I'm singing this song 
 The tears well up in my eyes I will always wonder 
 Why I will never have the life I wanted 
 Now I'm letting it go 
 'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more 
 No I don't wanna make you go 
 Through one more rainy day 
 No I don't wanna hurt no more 
 There's not much more to say 
 It's too late now 
 I won't hurt no more 
 So I wait till morning comes 
 You've made it clear that is has been 
 Only pain lovin' me 
 Things that we won't do for love 
 I am setting you free 
 'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more 
 I don't wanna make you go 
 Through one more rainy day 
 No I don't wanna hurt no more 
 Strange enough I always knew 
 I'm taking off today 
 I am letting you goSittin' on the beach, the island king of love, 
 Deep in fijian seas, deep in some blissful dream 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps, in the lap of her lover, 
 Subdued in all her rage 
 And I'm aglow with the taste, of the demons driven out... 
 And happily replaced, with the presence of real love 
 The only one who saves 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a world where people live and die with grace 
 The karmic ocean dried up, and leave no trace 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 The stillness in your eyes, convinces me that i, 
 I don't know a thing, 
 And I've been around the world, and I've tasted all the winds, 
 A half a billion times 
 Came sickened to your shores, you show me what this life is for 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a world where people live and die with grace 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds, 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 In this altered state ...in this altered state... 
 Full of so much pain and rage, 
 You know we got to find a way... 
 To let it go... 
 To let it go... to let it go... to let it go... 
 Sittin' on the beach, the island king of love, 
 Deep in fijian seas, deep in the heart of it all 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps, after eons of war, 
 And lifetimes she's smilin' 
 And free, nothin' left... 
 But a cracking voice and a song, oh lord 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a world where people live and die with grace 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I wanna dance with you, 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face... 
 We would not face... we would not face... 
 We would not face... we would not face...I'm just thinkin' about the child in me, 
 That I sometimes feel inside 
 And I'm figuring out just what it is 
 That makes me feel so small 
 Is it you, that hurts me when I give myself 
 Every day and every night 
 Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out 
 Did I really ask too much of you baby 
 Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is 
 Do you mean to say 
 It's all so hard, It's so hard 
 It's all so hard, It's so hard 
 As I search for an answer, I see the clear blue sky 
 And I know that you're the one to blame 
 And I feel so na've 
 When you say that our love to you was just a game 
 I dream, my dream, I'm sane, I'm insane 
 Oh, please don't, please don't speak to me that way 
 Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is 
 Do you mean to say 
 It's all so hard, It's so hard 
 It's all so hard, It's so hard 
 Damned it's so hard, why you're so hard 
 Why you're so hard, It's tearing me apartDon't kill that man, don't kill that man 
 He could be the one that brings you gifts for Christmas 
 Don't kill that man, don't kill that man 
 He could be the one for free without the dullness 
 This could be great 
 Don't just let go 
 He might be the one to know 
 The way you should be loved 
 A few words are enough 
 To lighten up your days when shadows fade away, 
 But I'm not sure he's safe 
 No, I'm not sure yet 
 Don't just let go 
 Don't kill that man, don't kill that man 
 He could be the one to trust when you've been lied to 
 Don't kill him yet, don't kill him yet 
 He could be the one you can turn your blind eye to 
 This is pure gut 
 Don't just let go 
 He could be that man who knows 
 The way you should be loved 
 A few words are enough 
 To lighten up your days when shadows fade away, 
 But I'm not sure he's safe 
 No, I'm not sure yet 
 He could be that man who knows 
 He could be the oneMake it rain 
 Right behind that perfect face 
 There's someone who keeps 
 Secrets hidden well 
 Think I don't want to know 
 Reasons why you're crashing over me 
 I don't look back 
 Darling so it goes 
 But I regret 
 We couldn't 
 Make it rain 
 And all our dreams were left to dry 
 Can't Make it rain 
 There's not one cloud left in the sky 
 You say you tried 
 We bled, we've cried 
 We couldn't make it rain 
 We had everything to live for 
 Even if we didn't understand 
 The game of give and take 
 Was more than just the sum 
 Of what we make 
 The most of time 
 So we'll move on 
 And leave it all behind 
 'Cause we couldn't 
 Make it rain 
 And all our dreams were left to dry 
 Can't Make it rain 
 There's not one cloud left in the sky 
 You say you tried 
 We bled, we've cried 
 We couldn't make it rain 
 Now I can't help thinking about 
 Places we would go 
 But I won't be around no more 
 But this fault won't be mine 
 Everything is gone 
 Make it rain 
 And all our dreams were left to dry 
 Can't make it rain 
 There's not one cloud left in the sky so 
 Make it rain 
 All our dreams were left to dry 
 Can't make it rain 
 There's not one cloud left in the sky so 
 You say you tried 
 We bled we cried 
 We couldn't make it rain 
 You said you tried 
 We bled we cried 
 You said you tried 
 We bled we've criedRule number one: there will be no rules 
 Rule number two: that's for you 
 Rule number three: when in doubt, there's the door 
 Rule number four: tell me more 
 No lies, no tricks of any kind 
 Be true, love hard, show inside 
 And I will absolutely love you 
 Rule number five: make sure God's on your side 
 Rule number six: it will never be fixed in the mix 
 Rule number seven: leave no space in between 
 And here's number eight: just be real, not make believe 
 When shadows appear, show me the power to shine 
 Travel the world all around 
 Laying the troubles downIt's not what I needed or what I wanted, but then again 
 Living a lie, I couldn't go on another day 
 There must have been a way to busy adoring you 
 It's over, oh oh 
 I hear hello, holding on my phone and I can't recall 
 That I ever felt this sad in my whole life before 
 My blood runs cold and honestly 
 I feel lonely, baby, so lonely, baby 
 These days are just way to bright 
 I need a reason to believe 
 'Cause I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I ain't the one you're looking for 
 Oeh, why do I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I ain't the one you need, no 
 We're talking all night to a filthy sky and some rain 
 I'm tryin' to find just little bits of yesterday 
 I guess you never knew how much I needed you, ooh 
 It's over 
 And handle it, covering my eye so I can see 
 Something's angels always what they seem to be 
 Things in my mind keep flashing by 
 What's going on, what the hell is going on 
 These days are just way to bright 
 I need a reason to believe, yeah 
 'Cause I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I ain't the one you're looking for 
 Ooh, why do I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I ain't the one you need, no 
 Ooh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Ooh, no 
 We're living a lie, baby, oh 
 We're living a lie, baby 
 We're living a lie, baby 
 We're living a lie, baby 
 We're living a lie, now 
 Lie now, heey, he-he-he-he 
 He-he-he-he 
 He-he-he-he 
 We're living a lie 
 We're living a lie, hey 
 We're living a lie, baby 
 We're living a lie, babyYou come around telling me you don't need me no more 
 You say it is all about to end 
 If you got nothing more to say then shut your pie hole 
 Just walk away and leave me lonely 
 'Cause there's no time to waste 
 For me to have a taste 
 Of all the other pretty men who're waiting out there 
 For me to give them all my lovin' 
 Now there's no doubt about it this girl still got it 
 Yeah I'm on fire give me something 
 Now there's no time to waste 
 For me to have it all 
 Know where we gotta go 
 Down where the water falls 
 Now walk on to the bay 
 Where I take off all my clothes 
 Hey baby what do you say 
 Well have you ever met a girl this sexy like me before 
 So when I woke up there were 3 of us this morning 
 You sure know how to treat me well 
 Don't want no flowers don't need love and understanding 
 This time it's all about myself 
 'Cause all this time around 
 Yeah I've been missing out 
 On a lot of love and affection 
 I'll hand you all directions 
 On how to walk on to the bay 
 Where I take off all my clothes 
 Hey baby what do you say 
 Have you ever met a girl this hot like me before 
 Just walk on the bay 
 Where we take off all our clothes 
 Ooh baby let me hear you say 
 I have never ever met a girl this juicy like you beforeI look at the ground, it's filled with lies 
 When you got lost, I got so lonely 
 Give it time, don't move on 
 Let it dry, time's passing by so slowly 
 Border lie face, I'll keep it straight 
 Cause no one knows, I only have dark days 
 New love, no use 
 Pain in my face, pretending as always 
 And these are the bright days 
 In my dreams I'll make you want me 
 One more time the sun will shine 
 'Cause they won't love you like I loved you 
 You still make me cry 
 Grief makes numb every day 
 How does it come? I get lost on the speedway 
 No joy or delight 
 Just prove me to bed so I can shut my eyes tight 
 (Did you love him like you know you should?) 
 I was in it for the long run 
 (Will you ever feel the same again?) 
 There's no turning back cause my heart is long gone 
 (Did you love him like you know you should?) 
 There's no turning back 
 (Will you ever feel the same again?) 
 In my dreams I'll make you want me 
 One more time the sun will shine 
 No, they won't love you like I've loved you 
 You still make me crySurely I am willing but I won't 
 Claiming that I'll do it but I don't 
 Knowing I'll do anything you want 
 Pretending I am someone that I'm not 
 Good God, my mind 
 Won't let me think right 
 I know you're trouble 
 But I'm determined to create 
 These things up in my head 
 That never happen 
 In time I've gotta choose 
 Freedom or loyalty 
 Look at what you have done 
 What am I gonna do? 
 So now that you have made a mess of me 
 And showed me stars that 
 I have never seen 
 I know it's wrong why does it feel so right 
 You haven't got me yet 
 But you might 
 You're smiling back at me 
 I wanna do it 
 I wanna be with you 
 Let me get through it 
 Am I gonna make it back alive 
 When you show me all the things that you can do? 
 Good God, my mind 
 Won't let me think right 
 I know you're trouble 
 But I'm determined to create 
 These things up in my head 
 That never happen 
 In time I've gotta choose 
 Freedom or loyalty 
 Look at what you have done 
 What am I gonna do? 
 Good God, my mind 
 Won't let me think right 
 I know you're trouble 
 But I'm determined to create 
 These things up in my head 
 That never happened 
 In time I've gotta choose 
 Freedom or loyalty 
 Look at what you have done 
 What am I gonna do?Another day is here another drama will appear 
 And I think it's time that I gave my mind a break 
 I'm feeling used and abused and misunderstood 
 I gotta find me a place 
 Where there's no one else around 
 Every time I see you walking away 
 My head's spinning around 
 No I never feel the same 
 I didn't know what I had baby till it was gone 
 No nothing even matters even matters at all to me 
 No more 
 I ain't done much lately 
 Sleeping and staring at the wall 
 Watchin' TV 
 And even though I'm down still 
 I have faith in my moon 
 Well I said hey get rid of it 
 Photographs of you here in my room 
 Reminding my heart and soul that I still love you 
 Whenever I'm with you it's wearing me out 
 No matter what you do you're the one I love 
 Now baby where did we go 
 Did we give it a chance 
 'Cause everything is about to go down tonight 
 And as I said before 
 I didn't know what I had baby till it was gone 
 No nothing even matters even matters at all to me 
 No more 
 And while you're out there in search of you 
 And try to keep it all together 
 Where were you when I needed you 
 I have faith in my moon 
 Well I said hey get rid of itCan you tell me how you feel 
 When you turn on your tv 
 When you see me singing through my tears 
 I've saved up all these years 
 Can you tell me what you see 
 When you read the magazines 
 Do you see yourself in me 
 When you read the magazines 
 When the DJ plays this song 
 Can you tell me what you hear 
 And I hope you feel the way we felt 
 When you put us all through hell 
 Can you tell me how you feel now 
 How do you feel, how do you feel 
 Tell me how you sleep at night 
 Do you take those pills like me 
 Or do you toss and turn 
 And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep 
 Cause you just don't care, 
 How do you feel 
 And now I'm in your face 
 And you feel that empty space 
 Why did we how did we come to fall from grace 
 Falling, falling 
 Didn't you just hear us calling out 
 No there's nothing left to say 
 Cause you shouldn't have stayed away 
 No man leaves his flesh and blood this way 
 And I hope you feel the way we felt 
 When you put us all through hell 
 Can you tell me how you feel now 
 How do feel, how do you feel 
 Tell me how you sleep at night 
 Do you take those pills like me 
 Or do you toss and turn 
 And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep 
 Cause you just don't care 
 How do you feel 
 It took a crowd for me to see 
 That it really wasn't me 
 The swaying crowd is the cleansing rain 
 It took the pain away 
 And I hope you'll find yourself alone 
 In a million dollar home 
 You will be stuck 
 With a heart like a rock 
 I hope you run out of luck fool 
 How do you feel now 
 Does it hurt, does it hurt 
 How do you feel now 
 Does it hurt baby 
 Does it hurt baby 
 Does it hurt baby 
 How do you feel 
 How do you feel now 
 Does it hurt baby 
 I'm just wonderin' how it feels 
 Just wonderin' 
 Does it hurtSure got my piece of heaven 
 An angel in disguise 
 Gone wild 
 But I thought you were a man 
 Who knew right from wrong 
 That's why I really don't understand 
 Why he's with her 
 It's killing me 
 What has she got that I don't have 
 Is it the way she looks at you 
 Laughs with you, can she, 
 Does she make you beg for more 
 This is hurting 
 What has she got that I don't have 
 I tried to call him 
 Anytime anywhere 
 But he's never there 
 So I went to his place 
 And waited all day 
 So he would explain it to me 
 And this is what he said: 
 There is nothing left to say 
 I had my fill, I went away 
 Your crying eyes won't change a thing 
 It was just a fling 
 Well how could an angel break my heart 
 He said: We could still be friends 
 Are you kidding me 
 What has she got that I don't have 
 Is it the way she looks at you 
 Talks to you, can she 
 Does she make you beg for more 
 This is hurting 
 What has she got that I don't have 
 But twice every year 
 When he's in tears 
 When he loses his mind 
 And can't help but cry 
 He'll call me and then 
 I am better than I am (x...)So many times I've cried 
 When dark clouds block the sunlight 
 And it's raining in my heart 
 I'll keep my head up high 
 So little time to try 
 To find out, about the feeling 
 That's deep inside of you 
 And keeps the dream alive 
 So remember 
 When you're down and out 
 In the sand 
 So many minds are torn 
 By overloading senses 
 You're breathing in and out 
 No second left to sigh 
 Can you tell me why 
 Nobody will tell me 
 What they're feeling deep inside 
 We're all just telling lies 
 Every time you wonder 
 Why the feeling lingers 
 And it's stuck inside your soul 
 You're crying when you smile 
 So remember 
 When you're down and out 
 When you're stuck in the middle 
 When you can't solve the riddle 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 When you can't help but shiver 
 Get you finger off the trigger 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 Get it out your head 
 Out of your hands 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 So remember 
 When you're down and out 
 When everything's missing 
 And there's nobody listening 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 When you can't help but shiver 
 Get you finger off the trigger 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 Get it out your head 
 Out of your hands 
 Lay it down 
 In the sandWhat about those songs you sang my love 
 Were they meant for her 
 And all those words you never said before 
 What about those kisses in my sleep 
 Were they meant for her 
 Tomorrow will be fine 
 Yeah just a little while 
 Oh no this ain't no way to live 
 'Cause I will be 
 Watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away 
 I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah 
 What about that bracelet in your car 
 Was it meant for her 
 I am more than you deserve 
 Tomorrow will be fine 
 Oh no this ain't no way to live 
 'Cause I will be 
 Watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away 
 I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah 
 Why couldn't you just lie, suicide 
 Why couldn't you just lie 
 Watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away 
 I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again 
 'Cause if I leave you by yourself 
 Don't you waste my time, suicide, suicide 
 Don't you waste my time, suicide yeah 
 I am more than you deserve 
 I am more than you deserve 
 I am more than you deserveHey Michel how's life are you ok 
 I wonder if you ever think of me 
 It's been 9 years since that kiss 
 I can help but reminisce 
 Hey Michel do you remember 
 We walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand you and me 
 Smiling faces so in love 
 Hoping that they all could see 
 That we belong together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way 'cause it wasn't meant to be 
 Now it's you and her I see 
 You were my first and worst love 
 And so it only could go wrong 
 But ain't that just the way you learn 
 Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know 
 That someone else has stolen my heart 
 And now another girl has caught your eye 
 That doesn't mean I don't think of you 
 I am just hoping that she'll treat you right 
 Do you remember 
 How we walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand and you and me 
 Smiling faces so in love 
 Hoping that they all could see 
 That we belonged together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way cause it wasn't meant to be 
 Now it is you and her I see 
 It was just a silly dream 
 Hey Michel do you rememberI feel completely disconnected from the world I'm living in 
 I try to understand, the way I'm thinking 
 Keep all options open, I'd rather wait and see 
 What's gonna happen next 
 Yeah I like to wait and see 
 What's gonna happen next 
 Yeah I like to wait 
 I choke on all the information 
 That keeps getting thrown at me 
 How do you decide, what to do 
 With all the complications, all the doubts 
 Do you want it with or without 
 So now you just wait and see... hey 
 Now you just wait 
 Please don't be mad 
 But I already miss you 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 I hope you missed your... your runaway train 
 I wake to find myself asleep 
 Weiry of life 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 And I'll try not to wait 
 Please don't be mad 
 But I already miss you 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 I hope you missed your... your runaway train 
 No don't be mad 
 'Cause I already miss you 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 Let's hope you missed your... your runaway train 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 Your runaway train 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 But anyway 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 I already miss you, yeah 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 It's such a shame 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 Anyway 
 I laugh, I'll moan, I'll cry 
 I already yeah 
 I already 
 I already miss you yeah 
 I already miss you yeah yeah yeah 
 I already miss you yeah 
 And I, I, I... 
 I already miss you yeah 
 I feel completely diconnected from the world I'm living in 
 I try to understand, the way I'm thinking 
 Keep all options open, I'd rather wait and see 
 What's gonna happen nextHere, if it's any consulation, take mine 
 No, no need for explanations, it's all right 
 With me it would only be redundant, see 
 If you only try to keep it all inside 
 I lay me down with your decision 
 Blow your mind, don't hesitate 
 This devil takes your pain away 
 Take mine 
 But now that I have finally found you 
 I'm gonna take it one step at a time 
 Let's try to keep this good thing going 
 You tell a joke, I nearly die 
 We have to laugh until we cry 
 Take mine, please take mine 
 My margarita chum, that's what you are 
 I'm laughing my ass off when you sing 
 Everybody's happy now 
 The Luna-queens become the lunatics 
 While Janis Joplin tells her friend 
 He's just a one-night-stand 
 Yeah 
 I hear you retching in my bathroom, but I don't mind 
 No, I'll clean it up tomorrow just sit down 
 Again you choke me when you grumble 
 You and me we're so much like RG 
 And now I'll show you how to tango 
 I think it's time for us to say 
 That this has been a perfect day and retire, please retire 
 My margarita cum, that's what you are 
 I'm laughing my ass off when you sing 
 Everybody's happy now 
 A v.i.p. is what you are to me 
 I love it when you take me on your lonely Sunday strollWhen your world comes crashing down 
 Don't waste no time 
 No this world's big enough for you and me 
 And when you need someone to hold 
 There's always someone around 
 Help, help them to help you 
 Help, help them to help you 
 'Cause when you're down 
 Stand up again 
 Breathe in 
 And when you're down 
 Come up again, breathe in 
 When you feel you're tumblin' down 
 Now don't you worry 
 You'll be back upon your feet again 
 When you need someone to hold 
 There's always someone around 
 Help, help them to help you 
 Help, help them to help you 
 'Cause when you're down 
 Stand up again 
 Breathe in 
 Yeah when you're down 
 Stand up again 
 Hold on 
 Soon your eyes will see the sun, I believe in love 
 Is it worth the tears you cry, what about the love 
 You should leave the past behind, do you believe in love? 
 You are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in, what you waiting for 
 Breathe in, you are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in, what you waiting for 
 Breathe in, soon your eyes will see the sun again 
 And again and againIt's funny how situations change 
 My imagination's playing games 
 I keep letting you back in my head 
 The glitter is gone spread your wings and fly 
 I'll try to keep it civilized 
 Baby all I wanted was you 
 Hold on hold on 
 There's more to come 
 Hold on lost one 
 'Cause there's some more 
 No one's ever hurt me more than you 
 I broken down in two pieces 
 And everything I sing is already been sung 
 Look at all these scars written on my skin 
 Some people find them hard to see 
 Now who will I be when 
 I'm not with you anymore 
 Hold on hold on 
 There's more to come 
 Hold on lost one 
 'Cause there's some more 
 You found yourself another place to hide 
 I can't believe that it's all set and done 
 I pray to God for you your choice was right 
 The time has come for me to let us go 
 Hold on hold on 
 There's more to come 
 Hold on lost one 
 'Cause there's some moreI lay my weapon down 
 Won't fight no more 
 Tryin' to get you by my side 
 Though I have been in love before 
 But they could never take my clouds away 
 Babe if you were mine 
 I won't hesitate at all 
 You just let me know 
 I'll be the one to catch your fall 
 Anything you need 
 Don't keep me away 
 You make me so confused 
 The one I love loves someone else 
 Don't stop the music it feels good 
 It keeps my mind of me missing you 
 Keep the rain away 
 There's nothing for me here 
 Without you by my side 
 'Cause babe if you were mine 
 I won't hesitate at all 
 You just let me know 
 I'll be the one to catch your fall 
 Anything you need 
 Don't keep me away 
 You make me so confused 
 The one I love loves someone else 
 Baby what's it gonna be 
 Is it gonna be her or me 
 Tell me that I have to do 
 'Cause I know that I'm good for you 
 And Babe if you were mine 
 I won't hesitate at all 
 You just let me know 
 I'll be the one to catch your fall 
 Anything you need 
 Don't keep me away 
 You make me so confused 
 The one I love loves someone else 
 Babe if you were mine 
 If you were mine 
 Babe if you were mine 
 Babe if you were mine 
 Babe if you were mine 
 If you were mineIt's good to see you after all this time 
 It's good to know that you are doing fine 
 But I can't help but notice in a bar on Friday night 
 There is something you should tell me 
 But your driver waits outside 
 You're moving on, you're going to a bigger world 
 You're moving on, you're ready for the universe 
 It's meaningless to me 
 'Cause you're not here to see 
 The bigger side of me 
 I swear I saw a tear roll down your face 
 But there's a lot of smoke in bars these days 
 All I notice is the light that shines upon you from aside 
 Getting jealous of the coffee in the cup you hold so tight 
 You're moving on, you're going to a bigger world 
 You're moving on, you're ready for the universe 
 It's meaningless to me 
 'Cause you're not here to see 
 The bigger side of me 
 You're moving on to God knows where 
 Send me a postcard when you're there 
 Will I remember? 
 What will it say 
 "The weather is nice today"? 
 You're moving on, you're going to a bigger world 
 You're moving on, you're ready for the universe 
 It's meaningless to me 
 'Cause you're not here to see 
 The bigger side of meIt's easier not to be wise 
 And measure these things by your brains 
 I sank into Eden with you 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 I'll read to you here, save your eyes, 
 You'll need them your boat is at sea 
 Your anchor is up, you've been swept away 
 And the greatest of teacher's won't hesistate 
 To leave you there by yourself 
 Chained to faith 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you, 
 Fear is not the end of this! 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you... 
 It's easier not to be great, 
 And measure these things by your eyes 
 We long to be here by His resolve 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 To cradle the baby in space 
 And leave you there by yourself 
 Chained to faith 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you, 
 Fear is not the end of this! 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you 
 Yeah 
 I alone love you 
 OH, now, we took it back too far 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 All come running back to you 
 All these rhythms that you hide 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 Yeah yeah yeah! 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you 
 I alone love you, 
 Fear is not the end of this! 
 I alone love you, 
 I alone tempt you, 
 I alone love you, 
 (Yeah-ah-ooh--yeah-ah ooh...) 
 I alone tempt you, 
 I alone love you...I'm sorry for the times that I made you scream 
 For the times that I killed your dreams 
 For the times that I made your whole world rumble 
 For the times that I made you cry 
 For the times that I told you lies 
 For the times that I watched and let you stumble 
 It's too bad, but that's me 
 What goes around comes around, you'll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain 
 'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane 
 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 I'm suckin' out his love, 'cause I, I'll never be nobody's wife 
 I'm sorry for the times that I didn't come home 
 Left you lyin' in that bed alone 
 Was flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder 
 You're like a stone hangin' round my neck, see 
 Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see 
 I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older 
 I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways 
 You know I've tried but I'm still the same 
 I've got to do it my own way 
 It's too bad, but hey, that's me 
 What goes around comes around, you'll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain 
 'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane 
 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 I'm suckin' out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife 
 It's too bad, but hey, that's me 
 What goes around comes around, you'll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain 
 'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane 
 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 I'm suckin' out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wifeThe words are slowly sinking in 
 Despair comes unexpected 
 Everything falls out of place 
 Now my imagination 
 It moves in all directions 
 I can only see your face 
 Now please don't leave me 
 I'm caught in the middle 
 It pulls me down to places no one goes 
 So you need to find out 
 If there's a chance for us 
 What a difference it makes 
 Waking up here without you 
 Baby we can make this right 
 The water's so much colder 
 Hours lasting longer 
 Ever since you went away 
 Having a different point of view 
 That doesn't make it right for you 
 To decide that you don't have to stay 
 No please don't leave me 
 I'm caught in the middle 
 It pulls down me to places no one goes 
 So you need to find out 
 If there's a chance for us 
 What a difference it makes 
 Waking up here without you 
 Baby we can make this right 
 This heart cannot erase you 
 After years replace you 
 Don't you think that's kind of sad 
 Now please don't leave me 
 I'm caught in the middle 
 It pulls me down to places no one goes 
 So you need to find out 
 If there's a chance for us 
 What a difference it makes 
 Waking up here without you 
 Baby we can make this right 
 We can make this rightThinking of when we were younger 
 (A long long time ago) 
 On the roof where we made out (oeeh) 
 You told me secrets 'cause you knew that 
 I'd keep it 
 Nowadays I feel so tired 
 (I really don't understand) 
 Of all the things you do and say (oeh) 
 Will you be just a reminder 
 Of what we've lost on our way 
 Can I say something 
 Baby, I am wishing on the stars above 
 That your eyes will finally open up 
 'Cause there was nothing 
 Enough to make another part of me believe 
 That you headed me blind not to see that 
 This was love, this was love 
 When I hear you tryin' call me 
 (In the middle of the night) 
 I won't answer, 'cause I'm scared (oeh) 
 That I rather had you with me 
 As I 
 I never thought of me without you 
 (Of me living alone) 
 You turned yellow in to grey (oeh) 
 Do you know how long I waited 
 For you to come my way 
 Can I say something 
 Baby, I am wishing on the stars above 
 That your eyes will finally open up 
 'Cause there was nothing 
 Enough to make another part of me believe 
 That you headed me blind 
 Ooh, an I say something 
 Baby, I am wishing on the stars above 
 That your eyes will finally open up 
 And there was nothing 
 Enough to make another part of me believe 
 That you had me blind not to see that 
 This was love, my loveOh, some things are better left unsaid 
 You'll find a nice place to hide them 
 But days like this 
 There is just too much going on, yeah 
 So I'm picking up the pieces of my past 
 But I can't find no peace at all 
 So in other words 
 I am so ready to be found 
 So I'll try and I might 
 Stand up and fight 
 To leave this place someday 
 All I need is that moment 
 To make me believe that you're alive 
 And then I'll be alright, alright 
 Paradise grown cold 
 One hand on my door 
 Way too high hopes 
 I can't tell right from wrong 
 Show me how it's done 
 Lord I need to be saved 
 And then I'll be alright, alright yeah 
 Oh yeah, on days like these 
 There is just too much going on 
 So I try and I might 
 Stand up and fight 
 To leave this place someday 
 All I need is this moment 
 To make me believe that you're alive 
 And then I'll be alright 
 Paradise grown cold 
 One hand on my door 
 Way too high hopes 
 I can't tell right from wrong 
 Show me how it's done 
 Lord I need to be saved 
 And then I'll be alright 
 And then I'll be alright 
 And then I'll be alright 
 And then I'll be alright 
 And then I'll be alright, yeahAll good things come to an end 
 That's why I block my heart 
 And chain it to the wall 
 Cause you haven't been there at all 
 In time my house became a place 
 Where the wrongs were right 
 And the rights were wrong 
 With too much drama and pain 
 But tell me, are you proud of who I am? 
 And can you please help me understand 
 Why you couldn't love me back? 
 Forgiveness ain't that hard to grasp 
 Daddy, I need to hear you say 
 I, I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby girl, you've got to believe me 
 I never meant to break your heart 
 I, I just wanted to love you 
 Somehow I didn't know how to 
 I still blame myself 
 Unable to receive the love 
 And affection from you 
 Like a daughter should 
 It did far more damage than good 
 Holding grudges are a waste 
 And life is way too short 
 And I just want to let go 
 Of all the things that I can't change 
 But tell me, are you proud of who I am? 
 And can you please help me understand 
 Why you couldn't love me back? 
 Forgiveness ain't that hard to grasp 
 Daddy, I need to hear you say 
 I, I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby girl you've got to believe me 
 I, I never meant to break your heart 
 I just wanted to love you 
 But somehow I didn't know how to 
 I still blame myself 
 If I had just one more day 
 No more promises we'll make 
 I would hold you tight 
 And tell you I love you anyway 
 I, I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby girl you've got to believe me 
 I, I never meant to break your heart 
 I just wanted to love you 
 But somehow I didn't know how to 
 I still blame myself 
 You should have been there 
 You should have been there for me 
 You sure didn't care for me 
 Where were you, baby?If roses are meant to be red 
 And violets to be blue 
 Why isn't my heart meant for you 
 My hands longing to touch you 
 But I can barely breathe 
 Starry eyes that make me melt 
 Right in front of me 
 Lost in this world 
 I even get lost in this song 
 And when the lights go down 
 That is where I'll be found 
 This music's irresistible 
 Your voice makes my skin crawl 
 Innocent and pure 
 I guess you heard it all before 
 Mister Inaccessible 
 Will this ever change 
 One thing that remains the same 
 You're still a picture in a frame 
 Lost in this world 
 I even get lost in this song 
 And when the lights go down 
 That is where I'll be found 
 I get lost in this world 
 I get lost in your eyes 
 And when the lights go down 
 That's where I'll be found 
 Yeah yeah 
 I get lost in this world 
 I get lost in your eyes 
 And when the lights go down 
 Am I the only oneWho is the one that makes you happy 
 Who is the one that always makes you laugh 
 Who is the reason you were smiling 
 And dragged you through these times, so rough 
 I was the one that made you happy 
 I was the one that eased the pain 
 But I'm the reason that you're crying now 
 My own tears scattered by the rain 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can set me free 
 You can be who you wanna be 
 Deeper than deep you took me on a trip baby 
 You shared your wildest dreams and more 
 You dare me to express my feelings to you 
 I never felt that need before 
 But suddenly you needed freedom 
 You felt the need to break free 
 You started drowning in your sorrow 
 You didn't wanna know I had the key 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can set me free 
 You can be who you wanna be 
 You can sacrifice me, sacrifice me 
 You can be who you wanna 
 You can be who you wanna beAha aha 
 Did you ever wake up in the morning 
 With a freight-train running through your head 
 An empty whiskey bottle by your pillow 
 And a burned out unfinished cigarette 
 The night went up in smoke 
 Life is but a joke man 
 But I see nobody laughing, nobody laughing 
 Did you ever live a day 
 Like the next day would never come 
 Blood's dripping on the floor, but who cares 
 Who needs you anyway you're a stranger to yourself 
 And this ain't no joke, man 
 But I can't stop laughing yeah 
 Greedy, angry people make me 
 Run around in circles backwards 
 Down the lonely road that keeps me 
 Run around in circles 
 How I want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead me 
 I just want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead the way 
 Just take me by the hand 
 How I want to yeah 
 I wanna try again yeah 
 Did you ever find yourself drowning 
 In a dark and crowded bar 
 The barman keeps on pouring and you're kissing everyone 
 The night will never end 
 No 
 'Cause my horse is still saddled up 
 That's why I am still laughing 
 Try, how I want to 3x How I want to, how enz.You, you you make me live my 
 Happy heart 
 To my love 
 And now you're gone 
 Since I fell for you 
 Love, brings my misery pain 
 'Cause I'll never be the same 
 Since I fell for you, yeah baby 
 Since your loveNo one can hear me, 'cause no one is around 
 But I still hear your whisper in the dark 
 I know I can go, I know I can leave when ever I please 
 But time is a jailer for me 
 A face in the window, looking inside 
 But no one else sees it, I know 
 And now that you've found that the years have changed 
 What the ending will be 
 Time's just a jailer for me 
 I shut out the light 
 Alone in the dark 
 This time of night 
 Is the hardest part 
 And now that you've found that the years have changed 
 What the ending will be 
 Time's just a jailer for me 
 I still hear the whisper, your heels on the floor 
 I wait for the sound of your key in the door 
 But it's only the sound of nothing at all and so it must be 
 That time is a jailer for me 
 But it's only the sound of nothing at all and so it must be 
 Time's just a jailer for me 
 Time's just a jailer for meI'm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs, yeah 
 Became a rock and roll singer 
 Been trying to find my way going uptown 
 Hard work and determination 
 I never asked for anything 
 No higher education 
 Stood up, tired of waiting 
 So many choices and illusions 
 Smack flow just to survive 
 All blues but no solutions 
 Struggle each day just to stay alive 
 It ain't just image I create 
 Don't fill your judgement full with hate 
 It ain't worth it 
 It ain't worth it 
 I'm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs, yeah 
 Became a rock and soul singer 
 Tried to find my way going uptown 
 Bring on that revolution 
 My kids' brown sugared skin 
 People jumping to conclusions 
 Letting me know I was made to sin 
 I'm so done with moderation 
 You look around, but you never look up 
 No intelligent conversation 
 I'll eat dirt, but I won't shut up 
 It ain't just image I create 
 Don't fill your judgement full with hate 
 It ain't worth it 
 It ain't worth it 
 I'm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs, yeah 
 Became a rock and soul singer 
 I tried to find my way going uptown 
 It ain't just image I create 
 Don't fill your judgement full with hate 
 It ain't worth it 
 It ain't worth it 
 I'm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs, yeah 
 Became a rock and soul singer 
 I tried to find my way going uptown 
 True blonde proud wigger 
 True blonde proud wigger 
 True blonde proud wigger 
 True blonde proud wiggerThey say that sometimes 
 You've got to pick up arms and fight 
 For what you believe is right 
 Some say, "That's just not the way 
 You will only make things worse" 
 So I close my eyes and turn my head away 
 And I hope it'll be all right 
 Fall into a restless sleep 
 While so many innocent die 
 That's why I sing, yeah 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Maybe someday soon 
 When we've thought things over 
 We'll know what to do, but probably 
 There's a much bigger chance, you see 
 That it will all be gone, gone 
 So I close my eyes and turn my head away 
 And just hope it'll be all right 
 Fall into a restless sleep 
 While so many others die 
 That's why I sing, yeah 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Yeah, yeah

 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here, yeah 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 They say that sometimes 
 You've got to pick up arms and fight 
 For what you believe is rightI'm telling you it was a long way down 
 Heaven and hell 
 And all the people that I have loved 
 Disappeared somehow 
 Now I just did what I have been taught 
 Covering up my soul 
 For those who do not need me 
 I must go on 
 I lay it down 
 When you walked I walked right with you 
 You know I was always around 
 Lay it down 
 Tell me where did it all went wrong 
 I'm running wild 
 Is it the things that I might have said 
 I only wish I knew 
 Now that the next waves come in slow 
 So I can still glide 
 Now take me to the one I love 
 With my head held high 
 Now lay it down 
 When you walked I walked right with you 
 You know I was always around 
 Lay it down 
 I guess I forgive you 
 I guess that I miss you 
 I can't help myself hey wait 
 No I don't wanna be alone the rest of my life 
 Now don't go 'cause it's too hard for me to 
 Lay it downI got my head in the clouds 
 Running from the thunder 
 Proud as I can be I am 
 Waiting for the grey to replace the black in me 
 Daddy, will the sun come up again 
 You and me, we fail to see 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 It's plain to see, you will agree 
 It's hard to stay together 
 Will we keep the thieves away 
 Will we both remember 
 To make the best of every chance 
 Or will we just surrender 
 Shouldn't we be making 
 Any effort needed to 
 Stop our dreams from fading 
 The sky is fading black to blue 
 We should be together 
 I am runnin' out of faith 
 And it takes something more each time 
 Before I put my heart in your hands daddy 
 You and me, did we fail to see 
 No one stays together 
 No it won't be easy 
 You will agree 
 To make this a forever 
 Will we keep the thieves away 
 Will we both remember 
 To make the best of every chance 
 Or will we just surrender 
 Shouldn't we be making 
 Any effort needed to 
 Stop our dreams from fading 
 Fading, fading, fading, fading, oohI've got time to think about 
 The things you think about when 
 You've got time to spare 
 Wonder why we're here 
 And I wonder when or where it might go wrong 
 I wonder why I went along with you 
 Why I forgot to think 
 Forgot to think it through 
 I wonder why I 
 I wonder why 
 You go on, you go on, you go on pushing yourself 
 You keep, you keep on, you keep on fooling yourself 
 You don't know why, you don't know 
 You don't know how, you just don't know 
 You keep on, I keep on fooling myself 
 There's a time and place for everything 
 A time to act, a time to dream 
 There's time to wait 
 But no time to waste 
 I wonder why I 
 I wonder why 
 You go on, you go on, you go on pushing yourself 
 You keep, you keep on, you keep on fooling yourself 
 You don't know why, you don't know 
 You don't know how, you just don't know 
 You keep on, I keep on fooling myself... myself... myself... myself... myselfTime's ticking and it's crawling forward 
 Turns boys into men, it's awkward 
 The good life 
 Time to live and a time to die 
 A time to fall and a time to fight 
 The good life 
 Every word is just another lie 
 I wonder why I do even try 
 I'm wishing that someone was near me now 
 Letting me know I'm OK, that I'll survive 
 Take me back ten years ago 
 When I thought 
 I lived the dream 
 My heart had been longing for 
 Tick tock, so many changes 
 Going through all the stages 
 The good life 
 A time to hate and a time to love 
 Time makes me wait for God 
 The good life 
 Unknown future 
 It's scaring me 
 So now this is all that I can be 
 Instead of making a fast run 
 Trying to make this heart 
 Come undone 
 Take me back ten years ago 
 When I thought 
 I lived the dream 
 My heart had been longing for 
 Cause time does not forget 
 What I was made for 
 So follow the stars 
 Without too many regrets 
 Time's ticking and it's crawling forward 
 It's a good life 
 Just a good lifeCrazy way to get your kicks 
 Shoot the silicone in your lips 
 If your figure makes you sad 
 Suck the fat right of your back 
 Make up your mind about your tits, girls 
 You can puff'm up so no bra will fit girls 
 There's only one thing they can't fix 
 No I won't let you be misled 
 That's the hole in your head 
 Can do nothing 'bout that 
 Hail hail modern world 
 Hail to all you boys and girls 
 Hail hail the colour green 
 Hail hail to what I've seen 
 Hail hail hail this modern world 
 Tell her that she's beautiful 
 And put her on a Pedestal 
 But as you google triple X 
 Imagination kicks in 
 The more you think about sex boys 
 With someone else the better it gets boys 
 You have a purpose in your life 
 Besides cheating on the wife 
 For fuck sakes show some sense 
 Hail hail modern world 
 Hail to all you boys and girls 
 Hail hail the colour green 
 Hail hail to what I've seen 
 Hail hail hail this modern world 
 These days adoption is a hot thing 
 You can get a child for nearly nothing 
 You take them home to a nanny 
 Buy off your guilt with toys and candy 
 But all the money that you work for girls 
 You can't compare it to love boys 
 There's only one thing they can't fix 
 No I won't let you be misled 
 And that's the hole in you head 
 Can't do nothing 'bout that 
 Hail hail modern world 
 Hail to all you boys and girls 
 Hail hail the color green 
 Hail hail to what I've seen 
 Hail hail hail this modern world 
 Yeah Yeah YeahRelationship lost on a stormy sea 
 I hold on to you 
 Just hold on to me 
 When the lighting strikes 
 You hear the thunder roaring 
 And you don't know how long 
 This will go on 
 But I know I still love you 
 And I know you still care 
 So keep on tryin' 
 When you're sure you still love me 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 Doesn't that mean anything 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 A sea of love 
 Don't let it drown us 
 We're way too far from shore 
 As we go deeper 
 As the wind grows stronger 
 It tries to tip us over 
 But we both learned how to swim 
 So let's just go on 
 'Cause I know I still love you 
 And I know you still care 
 So keep on tryin' 
 When you're sure you still love me 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 Doesn't that mean anything 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 Yeah I know I still love you 
 And I know you still care 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you, yeah 
 Doesn't that mean anything 
 I don't know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 And that's all I need to know 
 Yeah that's all I need to know babe 
 Oh that's all I need to know 
 That's all I need to know 
 For nowI remember you stepped in the store 
 And you kept me standing in one place for way too long 
 There you smiled at me but all that I could say was just 
 'Hello sir what will it be' 
 You're a Jesus with shoes on 
 I can see the light in your hair 
 It's happening again 
 Ooh baby 
 Well have you told your mom 
 That you won't be coming home 
 Don't you worry now 
 She can do it on her own 
 You shot me 
 In my heart 
 And I just wanna be 
 Your woman 
 Now we're all alone 
 You make me lose my cool 
 I can't deny it and I can't pretend 
 What I see is what I get 
 Your arms around me 
 Here we stand 
 Now I believe that we can make it through 
 Take me as I am it's up to you 
 Can you see the things that nobody else can see 
 Think it over now that you still can 
 Are you though enough to be my man 
 Or will you also try to walk away anyway 
 Well have you told your mom 
 That you won't be coming back 
 Boy you look so fine baby how about upstairsYou grabbed my hand and twisted it, so you had your way 
 No need to compromise 'cause you'll find the right words to say, 
 And I'll give it half a chance 
 Alone together, all alone, together all alone 
 Alone no more, it's Wednesday night 
 Someone is gonna treat me right 
 No, not my man gets me this high 
 It's gonna be my neighbour at number 29 
 I think I'll pack my bags and I'll leave it all behind 
 I'm gonna leave it all behind 
 No need to compromise 'cause these are the right words to say 
 Give it half a chance 
 Alone together, all alone, together all alone 
 Alone no more, it's Wednesday night 
 Someone is gonna treat me right 
 No, not my man gets me this high 
 It's gonna be my neighbour at number 29 
 Alone no more, it's Wednesday night 
 Someone is gonna treat me right 
 No, not my man gets me this high 
 It's gonna be my neighbour at number 29 
 You know, I was talking to my neighbour at number 29 
 No, not my man, It's not my man who gets me high 
 You know it's funny, 
 Alone no moreSee that girl, see her standing in the corner 
 On her own, scarred inside, she's a loner 
 Nobody can hear her crying at night 
 And see that all her smiles are tears 
 And she wears a mask to hide all her lies 
 To comfort all the fears 
 But when the sun's starting to fade 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 Cause tonight all the men in the street will tell her 
 That she is beautiful 
 Yes, she is beautiful 
 That she is beautiful 
 She is beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 That she is beautiful 
 She's a lonely girl with cold hard eyes 
 Who doesn't know what's right 
 Beyond any doubt wants to break out 
 And live another life 
 Well, I'm not saying it would be very easy 
 But you have to understand 
 All she needs is someone to set her free 
 And take her heart with gentle hands 
 When the sun's starting to fade 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 Cause tonight all the men in the street will tell her 
 That she is beautiful 
 That she is beautiful 
 She is beautiful, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, she is beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 She is beautiful 
 (Yeah, she is so beautiful)I close my eyes 
 And imagine you're here 
 Did it all seem so hopeless? 
 Given the chance 
 I would ask 
 Forgive me 
 I didn't do a thing to make you stay 
 I didn't say a word to make you stay 
 If I would have known 
 Could I have tried to make it easier? 
 But I didn't do a thing 
 Or say a word 
 One word 
 And I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone 
 No beautiful goodbye 
 You will never leave my mind 
 And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams 
 Now you're 
 You're a star in heaven 
 My thoughts unsaid 
 Stuck in my head 
 And it all feels so useless 
 Never forget 
 To give all I have 
 Forgive me 
 I couldn't do a thing to make you stay 
 And I couldn't say a word to make you stay 
 If I could have known 
 Could I have tried to make it easier? 
 But I couldn't do a thing 
 Or say a word 
 One word 
 And I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone 
 No beautiful goodbye 
 You will never leave my mind 
 And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams 
 Now you're 
 Yeah you're a star in heaven 
 Still I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone 
 No beautiful goodbye 
 You will never leave my mind 
 And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams 
 Now you're 
 You're a star in heaven 
 You're a star in heaven now 
 You're a star in heaven 
 Yeah you're my starThere's gonna be a yellow moon tonight 
 Don't leave the light on 
 Beads of sweat running down my face 
 You can catch them with your tongue 
 Colours run up and down your body 
 Every time you move 
 Every time, every time 
 Every time you move 
 When I kiss the pictures on your skin 
 Make me shiver with the fire 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skin 
 A pair of eyes that stare across the room watching you breathing 
 Magic signs scratched inside a heart 
 Filled with your name 
 Colours run up and down your body 
 Every time you move 
 Every time, every time 
 Every time you move 
 When I kiss the pictures on your skin 
 Make me shiver with the fire 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skin 
 The reds, the blues, the greens and the greys 
 All bleed their colours through a sweaty haze 
 And we slide like a serpent on silky sheets and that twist and turn 
 Forever and ever and ever 
 Soft as a butterfly, stings like a bee 
 Soft as a butterfly, stings like a bee 
 Colours run up and down your body 
 Every time you move 
 Every time, every time 
 Every time you move 
 When I kiss the pictures on your skin 
 Make me shiver with the fire 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skinYou ask me what is on my mind 
 You notice there's a change 
 There's something different 
 Different in the way I look at you today 
 See I've been alone for so long baby 
 Now I cannot explain 
 I must be completely out of my mind 
 To ever take the chance 
 I ain't got no trouble still I worry 
 That I might have to lose you 
 See I've been alone for so long baby 
 Now I cannot explain, I've been alone for so long 
 I took the chance to lose you 
 No I must be insane, I've been alone for so long 
 I'm not gonna lose you 
 I never ever really tried 
 I never had the strength 
 But now I got you, got you by my side 
 I'm gonna make this work 
 You see, I've been alone for so long baby 
 All the tings I've done when I was alone I can't understand myself 
 It's amazing, you amaze me 
 But my life begins with the songs I sing and the love you bring to me 
 It's amazing, you amaze meHaven't I told you, baby 
 The way you makin' me feel 
 Givin' me heart fever 
 God is real 
 I'm playing it cool as ice 
 But you makin' me burn inside 
 Happier for myself 
 Good man 
 Now you will never know 
 The way you me feel all over 
 You gotta understand 
 I didn't want no other man 
 No, all I wanted was you, baby 
 This wouldn't go without no blisters 
 But we would find other ways 
 And make it all right before it's over 
 No I ain't crazy 
 Now god would guide us every day 
 I didn't want another you, no 
 And even on top of that you told me 
 Baby, I don't want you gone, gone 
 It had to be hard for you 
 Living this kind of lifestyle 
 Especially with someone 
 Who is out of her damn mind all the time 
 You saying I'm crazy, copy that 
 But you gotta understand 
 It's the way I am, it's the way I live now 
 Now I mean no harm to you 
 Was laying my gun down 
 And give you all I had to 
 Have you around 
 It's not that I don't care 
 And if you find another lady 
 But just remember, as clumsy as I am 
 You were save with Mrs Crazy 
 'Cause all I wanted was good for you baby, baby 
 This wouldn't go without no blisters 
 'Cause we would find other ways 
 And make it all right before it's over 
 No, no, no, no, no, no I ain't crazy 
 'Cause god would guide us every day 
 I didn't want another you, no 
 And even on top of that you told me 
 Baby, I don't want you gone, gone 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, heeey 
 No no no, no no no, no no no, no, I ain't crazy, no

 I didn't want another you 
 I didn't want another you, noI found myself in another dimension 
 I got the killer in my hand 
 I'm laying back, I can feel no tension 
 There's no turning back 
 I do not care for your opinions 
 Just trying to get by 
 And make the worried go away 
 Not getting high 
 I wanna little something, something 
 I wanna feel the love inside 
 I wanna little something, something 
 Let the day turn to night 
 'Cause when I'm high I go up, 
 And I reach the stars 
 What more can I say? 
 All the bruises you left me 
 Closing my heart 
 Throw them all away 
 And maybe the world's an ocean 
 And I'm just a step and stone 
 Your words will never hurt me 
 They'll never break my bones 
 I do not care for your opinions 
 Just tryina get by 
 And make the worried go away 
 Not getting high 
 I wanna little something, something 
 I wanna feel the love inside

 They take the time 
 And realize I do love them now hear me out 
 'Cause I'm singing this song for you' 
 And this is my way of letting you know and say 
 'Thank you' 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you 
 Nobody's ever going to erase you 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you 
 Nobody's ever going 
 To all the men that I loved in my life 
 Thank you for letting me know I ain't always right 
 Back in the days there was nothing I wouldn't do 
 I went through all of the fires to be with you 
 And though I was getting tired 
 Of the same old thing 
 You all took me places I've never been 
 And I love you for that 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you 
 Nobody's ever going to erase you 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you

 Nobody's ever going to erase youJust because 
 I may act like I know everything in life 
 It doesn't mean my hands don't shake 
 Got burning eyes 
 Inside I die 
 Look around the dawn of grace 
 I'm living in the last days 
 I couldn't tell the rights from wrongs 
 It's all the same 
 I live for is dreams I fear 
 The truth is that I don't know nothing 
 And I don't know why 
 All the answers I don't have 
 Make me feel so worthless 
 God knows what lies ahead 
 So unreal 
 As I rely on lies instead of what I feel 
 Overwhelmed by modern days 
 Is there a right place in this life? 
 I couldn't tell 
 In fact I don't know nothing 
 No, I don't know why 
 All the answers I don't have 
 Make me feel so worthless 
 God knows what lies aheadHell begins all in the mind 
 And so you pray for inner light 
 I know you're feeling left behind 
 But please don't say that nothing's ever right 
 Cause every now and then somebody will just come along 
 To take you out of the light 
 Don't try to make them love you 
 Never cherish wrong thoughts 
 Don't criticize 
 That some of us ain't got no joy 
 They ain't got no love 
 Yeah, they ain't got no life 
 Heaven is what you create 
 Just think something good 
 And you'll begin to rise 
 And don't look back at yesterday 
 It's understood 
 That if you seek, you'll find 
 Every now and then somebody will just come along 
 To take you out of the light 
 Don't try to make them love you 
 Never cherish wrong thoughts 
 Don't criticize, 
 That some of us ain't got no joy 
 They ain't got no love 
 Yeah, they ain't got no life 
 Now I feel for them 
 Yeah, I feel for them 
 I feel for them 
 I feel badly for them 
 'Cause they're missing out on life 
 Yeah, they're missing out on life 
 That's no life, that's no life 
 No lifeDon't you ever try to leave me 
 I wouldn't know what to do 
 And I know this life ain't easy 
 But we will make it through 
 Stop for a minute, baby 
 I will go anywhere 
 Take all the time you need 
 As long as I'm with you, I don't care 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose track 
 Kiss me 'til my lips are numb 
 Squeeze my heart until it breaks ('til it breaks) 
 I'm not afraid of the burden song 
 No, I will do whatever it takes 
 Stop the pity and the sorrow 
 Come here, you will see 
 We can have fun tomorrow 
 In a place where it's just you and me 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose track 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 And we will start something new 
 And leave everything behind 
 'Cause I have never stopped loving you 
 If only we could turn back time 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 Let's run away together and never look back 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose trackThe sounds of the world escape me 
 The moments you crack 
 Now you're driving 
 Down the highway of regrets 
 You're a victim 
 Of your appetite 
 Promises broken 
 Yeah 
 You're that restless kind 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Stop this from pullin' us under 
 Baby no one can do this but you 
 Blue dreams about you 
 My eyes wide open 
 You think you lost it 
 My heart for you 
 The sphere of you're not being here with me 
 You move in slow motion 
 Stopping rewind 
 Back to better times 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Stop this from pullin' us under 
 Only you can stop this 
 Stop this from pullin' us under 
 Baby no one can do this but you 
 But you... Hey 
 Only you, only you can stop this 
 Only you, only you can stop this, yeah, yeah 
 Only you, only you can stop this, yeah 
 Only you, only you can stop this, yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Only you, come on baby 
 Yo baby, only you can stop this, hahahaDay in day out keep it out of sight 
 The things we do without a thought 
 It never has to end 
 Draw the blinds entertain yourself 
 'Cause there's no room for someone else 
 Just leave the world outside 
 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what it's all about 
 Now baby wouldn't it be great 
 If we could turn it all around 
 Careless people will remind you 
 We're losing grip and need a shift 
 There's no easy way out 
 Some will tell you that there's nothing wrong 
 Just get on with what you want 
 It never has to end 
 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what it's all about 
 Now baby wouldn't it be great 
 If we could turn it all around 
 Day in day out keep it out of sight 
 The things we do without a thought 
 It never has to end 
 Draw the blinds entertain yourself 
 'Cause there's no room for someone else 
 Just leave the world outside 
 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what it's all about

 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what it's all about 
 Now baby wouldn't it be great 
 If we could turn it all around 
 One controls all that he sees 
 Would you like to see me crawling 
 One is what he wants to be 
 But he feels he's only fallin' down 
 One's in paradise 
 One searches his way back home 
 Well I say 
 One is cool 
 One is tired 
 One is smart 
 One is crying 
 One is dead 
 One is high 
 Did I wake up in time 
 We all are lost inside the maze 
 We can't find our way home 
 Now baby wouldn't it be great 
 If we could turn it aroundThis ain't my home anymore 
 My beating heart and restless mind in woe 
 My eyes have closed on my way back home 
 To a place that no one knows 
 I travel light, no more starless nights 
 Makes me shine from head to toe 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 I've got places to go anytime 
 What's yours ain't mine anymore but somehow 
 The roads I travel feel like home right now 
 My eyes have closed on my way back home 
 To a place that no one knows 
 I travel light, no more starless nights 
 Makes me shine from head to toe 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 I've got places to go anytime 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 I've got places to go anytime 
 Ain't my home anymore 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 I've got places to go, places to go 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 I've got places to go in this life 
 Ain't my home anymoreIf I had nothing, 
 Would you die for me? 
 If I ever lose my mind, 
 Would you fight for me? 
 Cause lately you 
 Haven't been around. 
 I am still waiting babe 
 To be found. 
 Do any of your ladies ever get tired, 
 Tired of being strong, 
 Still trying to make things right, 
 When he's going to long? 
 No I won't play that game no more. 
 Cause you will never know how bad it hurts 
 When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor. 
 I won't play that game no more. 
 No more tears on my pillow case, 
 Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made. 
 <You made> 
 The night's so cold 
 And I am all alone. 
 And I have been way to long 
 On my own. 
 Probably you 
 Couldn't care less 
 If I would sufficate 
 From loneliness. 
 Do any of your ladies ever get tired, 
 Not knowing where you stand? 
 But still you can help yourself 
 From nothing than me. 
 I won't play that game no more. 
 Cause you will never know how bad it hurts 
 When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor. 
 I won't play that game no more. 
 No more tiers on my pillow case, 
 Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made. 
 Think about all your lies 
 As I walk away from you. 
 Leaving me here to cry, 
 There's nothing left to do. 
 So get out of my life, 
 I won't make up my mind no! 
 I won't play that game no more. 
 Cause you will never know how bad it hurts 
 When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor. 
 I won't play that game no more. 
 No more tiers on my pillow case, 
 Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made. 
 No I won't play that game no more. 
 No more 
 No more 
 No more 
 I had enough 
 I had enough 
 No moreI will help myself if you don't have the time 
 It ain't hard to find a new lover 
 Now it's your loss baby better check your mind 
 What you got don't cover my needs 
 Can't help myself when I start to show a sign 
 I need love it's like an addiction 
 I'd hurt myself 
 If I don't get away 
 I got to get myself a greater sensation 
 I need more then you could give me 
 Don't you know that I'm a lovedrunk 
 Careful now before I'll break your heart 
 I will charm you with my own style 
 Long enough to make you think I'm yours 
 Don't make me wait 'cause that would be a crime 
 It is easier to find me another 
 I'll find someone and I will get what is mine 
 I keep looking for the better connection 
 I'll help myself if you don't have the time 
 Watch me boy I'm out on a mission 
 You don't give me all that I need 
 So I continue with my little obsession 
 I need more than you could give me 
 Don't you know that I'm a lovedrunk 
 Careful now before I'll break your heart 
 I will charm you with my own style 
 Long enough to make you think you're mine 
 Listen baby there's something I gotta tell ya 
 I'm a lovedrunk 
 I'm on a mission baby 
 I'm so intoxicated 
 I'm so bad 
 Either way yeah I'm gonna get it get itLost in time I can't count the words 
 I said when I thought they went unheard 
 All of those harsh thoughts so unkind 
 'Cause I wanted u 
 And now I sit here I'm all alone 
 So here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home 
 A circle of angels deep in war 
 'Cause I wanted u 
 Weak as I am, no tears for u[X2] 
 Deep as I am, I'm not ones fool 
 Weak as I am 
 So what am I now? I'm loves last hope 
 I'm all of the soft words I once owned 
 If I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air 
 'Cause I wanted u 
 Weak as I am, no tears for u[X2] 
 Deep as I am, I'm no one's fool 
 Weak as I am 
 In this tainted soul } 
 In this weak young heart } x 3 
 Am I too much for u } 
 Weak as I am[x4] am, am 
 Weak as I am } 
 Am I too much for you } x3 
 Weak as I amWalking through September rains unknowing 
 How you come around, is that guilt still growing? 
 As you slowly fade away 
 You were standing tall, but that's the past 
 As many other things they do not last 
 Though I had to step away 
 I'm wondering are you lonely 
 Ever since you walked away 
 It's so clear 
 'Cause when you're in a shower all alone 
 That's when you fall down 
 Not able to stand up again 
 At night as you turn down the sheets 
 That's when you feel your mind 
 When it's trying to go back in time 
 You don't even know how it all started 
 Still begging for my love, now we have parted 
 Though I had to step away 
 I'm wondering are you lonely 
 Ever since you walked away 
 It's so clear 
 'Cause when you're in a shower all alone 
 That's when you fall down 
 Not able to stand up again 
 At night as you're turning down the sheets 
 That's when you feel your mind 
 When it's trying to go back in timeI know you've been lying boy 
 Every single word you say 
 It's the way your lips shake 
 When you're... 
 Getting down and dirty baby

 Cause there is you 
 No matter how I try to tell you you just can't see 
 Oh no, I won't get through 
 You've got a body and a brain 
 Instead of pointing to another 
 Take a look at yourself 
 Why don't you just use that thing inside you head 
 And try to tell me why 
 You've got a body and a brain 
 You're free to speak, could you explain 
 The reason for your narrow mind 
 You're thinking medieval times 
 Your ignorance just gets you scared 
 Of everything and I don't know 
 Which way the wind is blowing 
 Hoping it will blow your fears away 
 I'm sure I'll never solve this problem 
 But I hope you will 
 I'll speak my mind and tell you 
 Time and time again 
 Though I won't get through 
 You've got a body and a brain 
 You're free to speak, could you explain 
 The reason for your narrow mind 
 You're thinking medieval times 
 Your ignorance just gets you scared 
 Of everything and I don't know 
 Which way the wind is blowing 
 Hoping it will blow your fears away 
 Blow your fears away 
 Time and time and time and time again 
 But I can't get through baby 
 Let me explain 
 You've got a body and a brain 
 You're free to speak, could you explain 
 The reason for your narrow mind 
 You're thinking medieval times 
 Your ignorance just gets you scared 
 Of everything and I don't know 
 Which way the wind is blowing 
 Hoping it will blow your fears awayI guess this time 
 I've had more than enough 
 You allowed my mind 
 To think there's no true love 
 Baby you're out of line 
 Wasting all my time 
 Now find your own 
 To brighten up your life 
 I got a dark cold feeling 
 That I've been here before 
 The obvious ain't hard to see 
 She turned around and smiled 
 In her high heel shoes 
 Standing right in front of me 
 And I said leave him alone 
 Find one of your own 
 Took me a long time 
 To find a man like mine 
 The dreamer with a right run 
 Now he ain't made for you 
 Like the way I am 
 It's not for you to understand 
 And I said leave him alone 
 And find a man of your own 
 Don't you break up my heart 
 Yeah, leave him alone 
 I hate it 
 I'll need a big black hole 
 For you to fall in 
 Baby, you ain't coming back 
 And if you try once more 
 You get two feet in the door 
 I'll be taking you to pitch black 
 You can have my own 
 I'm out of control 
 So I am asking you nicely 
 For the last time 
 To leave him alone 
 Find a man of your own 
 Don't you break up my home 
 Girl leave mine alone 
 I guess this time 
 I've had more than enough 
 You will allow my mind 
 To think there's no true love 
 Baby you're out of line 
 Wasting all my time 
 Now find your own 
 To brighten up your lifeBetween these walls I used to live 
 Without receiving 
 So much that I had to give 
 Between these walls 
 There were a lot of things that I've could 
 Have done differently 
 But it ain't about the way I live 
 It's the heart that counts 
 Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me 
 Ain't that what I'm here for, you said you'd be here for me 
 No matter what 
 How come it feels so cold every time 
 You step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold when you're mine? 
 In the spring of '75 that's when God made a mistake 
 He took me here 
 To the wrong side 
 I guess you did the best you could 
 But never good enough 
 'Cause it's the heart that counts 
 Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me 
 Ain't that what I'm here for?! 
 You said you would die for me, remember? 
 How come it feels so cold every time you step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold 
 I'm freezing 
 Stuck here with this broken heart 
 All I can do is hoping for a full recovery 
 Why did you have me in the first place? 
 Well... Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me, yeah 
 Comfort, feed, embrace, baby just respect me 
 How come it feels... so cold every time 
 Comfort, feed, embrace, love and respect me 
 Just respect me... 
 Just respect me... 
 How come it feels so cold every time... 
 Baby love me 
 Baby love me 
 You love me, yeah 
 Oh love me, yeah 
 Just love me, yeah (2x)Yeah, it's 5 in the morning 
 That's what we do 
 We hardly sleep at all 
 It's getting late 
 We're just lying here with our mind full of thoughts 
 Awake dwelling on mistakes we've made 
 It's 5 in the morning 
 And what we'd give to turn back time sometimes 
 To keep away that pain in life 
 And stop 
 And how we try to give you so much more 
 For you're my eyes, pride, my Fantastic Four 
 Only a mother 
 Only a mother would understand 
 Two of the strongest kids I will ever know 
 Yeah, you're my sunlight on a rainy day 
 My falling stars when I'm far away 
 It's 5 in the morning 
 You're the ones that teach me life 
 And stop 
 I'm telling you, baby 
 I love you 
 I love you, only you 
 I was blessed by God 
 The moment He, yeah 
 He sent you from above 
 So I could learn how to care and how to love 
 It's 5 in the morning 
 You're the song inside my soul 
 And stop 
 I'm telling you, baby 
 Only a mother 
 Only a mother would understandTo this generation 
 We cannot forget 
 The ones that we have loved 
 The ones we left behind 
 Don't be afraid to reach out 
 This world is changing fast 
 For those who take a stand 
 Heaven knows 
 We grieve in our life 
 Don't let us pay the price (grief in our life, grief in our life) 
 So much grief in our life 
 It will fade over time (grief in our life, grief in our life) 
 Yeah to this generation 
 It's hard to get along 
 And we cannot deny 
 The struggles through this life 
 It won't do no good to wait 
 We're running out of time 
 For those who take a stand 
 Heaven knows 
 We grieve in our life 
 Don't let us pay the price (grief in our life, grief in our life) 
 So much grief in our life 
 It will fade over time (grief in our life, grief in our life) 
 Guilty for we turn the other cheek 
 Guilty for not willing to achieve 
 Come on happiness what's keeping you so long 
 How can we forget 
 Yeah yeah yeah

 Yes we grieve in our life

 Yes we grieve in our life 
 It will fade over time 
 We grieve in our life 
 Don't let us pay the price 
 Oh yeahOh life is bigger 
 It's bigger than you 
 And you are not me 
 The lengths that I will go to 
 The distance in your eyes 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I set it up 
 That's me in the corner 
 That's me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 And I don't know if I can do it 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I haven't said enough 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you strive 
 Every whisper 
 And every waking hour I'm 
 Choosing my confessions 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 Like a hurt lost and blinded fool (fool) 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I set it up 
 Well, consider this 
 Consider this the end of the century 
 Consider this as well 
 It brought me to my knees failed 
 What if all these fantasies 
 Come flailing around 
 Now I've said too much 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you strive 
 But that was just a dream 
 That was just a dream 
 That's me in the corner 
 That's me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 And I don't know if I can do it 
 Oh no I've said too much 
 I haven't said enough 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you strive 
 But that was just a dream 
 That was just a dream 
 And that was just a dream 
 Just a dream, just a dream 
 Dream dream dream dream...Last time you're breaking my heart 
 It's the last time 
 Last time I'm falling apart 
 It's the last time 
 Took a while to even up the score now 
 Last time, baby once more 
 Last time, you're breaking my heart 
 It's the last time 
 Last time once again, it's the 
 Last time I'm on my own again 
 How could I be so blind 
 How could I be so blind 
 How could you take me for granted all these years 
 You kept telling me, no it won't happen again, 
 But every time I turn around, you stab me in the back 
 Your perfect smile ain't flashing anymore 
 You're magic is gone, boy 
 This time I'm breaking your heart 
 It's my turn now 
 It's my turn to let you fall apart 
 I'm gonna make your eyes burn 
 And what I really have learned from this 
 Is that I'm never gonna follow my heart again 
 And that there're people living in this world 
 Who'll treat you like a dog, like they just don't care 
 And 'cause I don't deserve this 
 I'm gonna watch my steps before I get me some ass 
 This is, this is the last time 
 How could you take me for granted all these years 
 You kept telling me, no it won't happen again, 
 But every time I turn around, you stab me in the backI have drunk virginia water 
 I have dug my own gravesend 
 Set my foot ashore in new port 
 Travelled far beyond my landsend 
 And home is in my head 
 I have dived into a blackpool 
 With a maidstone around my neck 
 I just drifted into the southsea 
 With no hull beyond my deck 
 And home is in my head 
 Well I have lost a wheel in barrow 
 Try to cross the no one cambridge 
 When my liverpool grey shallow 
 Had to dig more wells in turnbridgeLately I've been feeling down 
 I don't get around much anymore 
 So I just spend my time alone 
 Waiting for the phone to ring 
 I keep thinking of you 
 I miss the language that we speak 
 When we don't even talk 
 And every time I see you smile 
 You make it all worthwhile 
 I keep thinking of you 
 I never loved someone like this before 
 Keep staring at your picture while I try to 
 Work my way around you 
 But nothing's any good 
 'Cause I keep thinking of you 
 You never told me I would feel 
 Lonely without you 
 You're not supposed to make me cry 
 You said: don't you worry, I'm yours 
 And in a while you were gonna call me 
 Well it's been six hours now 
 I keep thinking of you 
 I got to stop thinking of you 
 I got to stop thinking of you 
 I... gotta stopWell if you leave in dusty twilight baby, that's OK, 
 'Cause there are women at the bar to greet you everyday. 
 And you can take them back to lie with you and visit Jamie's room, 
 But they can never take the pain away or brighten all the gloom, 
 And if your hands are cleansed with sorrow, may it help you ease your pain, 
 Though the windows have a view of city rain, city rain... 
 And if you walk in constant sorrow and you cry for me, 
 May it hit the painful memories, maybe then you'll see, 
 That if you drown yourself in liquor, because it keeps you company, 
 Then just remember who you're losing, and be proud to set me free, 
 Because it don't take back or disagree, it just make you see so hazily, 
 But in the morning light your life is scattered with the wind, scattered with the wind... 
 Well they tell you on the telephone to let him go, 
 They tell you he's a sinking ship, and he's trying to pull you down, 
 Don' t you know, that every time you call me up 
 And say you want me back you know you break my heart, 
 You said you want me to come back home and try again, 
 You want me to make a brand new start, 
 But if wisdom says to let him go, then it's hell, because you just don't know, 
 Until you've tried to love a man who's lovin' whiskey, lovin' whiskey... 
 My baby left me for the bottle and the lure of the nightlife, 
 Good times and crazy women and another glass of Tangueray, 
 But if wisdom says to let him go, then it's hell, because you just don't know, 
 Until you've tried to love a man who's lovin' whiskey, lovin' whiskeyPeople will always talk behind your back, no matter what 
 But I'm telling you, it says nothing about you 
 It says more about their lack of emotional intelligence 
 And I know that life isn't always fair, but so what? 
 You just need to get back up 
 And dust off your shoes and try again, and maybe again 
 Yeah, well if you're feeling uptight 
 Got nothing to relate to 
 I'm telling you that in time things will just go away 
 And I will show you sunshine 
 And how to appreciate life 
 Yeah, I will remember you to be strong every day 
 Leave it alone, better hold on tight 
 And be who you are, get back up and try 
 When they make you feel that you don't belong 
 No matter what, stay strong 
 Gotta keep your head up high 
 Don't give in to peoples' lies 
 No, just shine, yeah 
 Soon there'll be a brighter day 
 Come and chase those clouds away 
 Just smile, just smile, pretty baby 
 When tiger hearts burn bright 
 They'll make you fight a good fight 
 The sun will not always shine for you every day 
 Just lead the way, don't be shy 
 And lift your head up way high 
 Even when think you lose your faith along the way 
 Leave it alone, better hold on tight 
 And be who you are, get back up and try 
 When they make you feel that you don't belong 
 No matter what, stay strong 
 Gotta keep your head up high 
 Don't give in to people's lies 
 No, just shine, just shine 
 Soon there'll be a brighter day 
 Come and chase those clouds away 
 Yeah, just smile 
 I'm telling you to always smile, my love 
 Don't let anyone else tell you what is right 
 Don't let anyone else, no anyone tell you what is right 
 God will applaud you for it

 What goes around comes around, you'll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain

 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 I'm suckin' out his love, 'cause I, I'll never be nobody's wife

 Is he hiding behind the moon? 
 'Cause I could use somebody who will treat me right 
 Who's shouting 'I love you too' 
 Now I cannot wait any longer 
 Won't you please help me find my man? 
 Where is the one who'll protect me from harm, who'll love me and understand? 
 If it's not happening anytime soon, then just fool me 
 Oh, oh, oh, looking for someone to love 
 Baby, I'm trying so hard to be content with my life the way it is 
 Still there's a short time for me that is left 
 And it takes so much more that in gives 
 All alone too many nights lost inside my hopes and dreams 
 Longing for someone to hold in my arms 
 But it never can be it seems 
 And if it's not happening anytime soon, then just fool me 
 Now hit me

 Watching the stars on the big screen. 
 Then he lies awake and he wonders, 
 Why can't that be me 
 Cause in his life he is filled 
 With all these good intentions 
 He's left a lot of things 
 He'd rather not mention right now 
 But just before he says goodnight, 
 He looks up with a little smile at me, 
 And he says, 
 If I could be like that, 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day, in those shoes 
 If I could be like that, 
 What would I do, 
 What would I do, 
 Now in dreams we run 
 She spends her days up in the north park, 
 Watching the people as they pass 
 And all she wants is just 
 A little piece of this dream, 
 Is that too much to ask 
 With a safe home, and a warm bed, 
 On a quiet little street 
 All she wants is just that something to 
 Hold onto, that's all she needs 
 Yeah! 
 If I could be like that, 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day, in those shoes 
 If I could be like that, what would I do, 
 What would I do 
 I'm falling into this, in dreams 
 We run away 
 If I could be like that, 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day, in those shoes 
 If I could be like that, what would I do, 
 What would I do 
 If I could be like that, 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day, in those shoes 
 If I could be like that, what would I do, 
 What would I do 
 If I could be like that, 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day, in those shoes 
 If I could be like that, what would I do, 
 What would I do 
 Falling inI'm watching your shadow cut by the moon 
 Peacefull I wait for the dawn 
 These moments in silence are all that I need 
 The softness of hearing you breathe 
 And I know it doesn't get better than this 
 Funny it starts with just one little kiss 
 Baby all I know you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home of our own love 
 All my love is yours, you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home, of our own love 
 Your ups and your downs, powers and fears 
 Your presence fulfills my desire 
 You're all that I wished for 
 You're more than I need, you're right where I want to be 
 I don't ask questions or try to explain 
 Telling myself it just happens this way 
 Baby all I know no, you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home of our own love 
 All my love is yours, you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home, of our own love 
 I don't ask questions 
 Or try to explain 
 Telling myself it just happens this way 
 Baby all I know you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home of our own love 
 All my love is yours, you're no longer alone 
 We've started a home, of our own loveSir can you tell me how to get to Jerusalem 
 'Cause I have kinda lost my way 
 Sir will you help me get there as fast as I can 
 Tomorrow might be too late 
 'Cause things ain't what they used to be 
 My love for life is gone you see 
 Am I fighting things I cannot see 
 People always tellin' me how sweet and simple life could be 
 They say you might as well live before you die 
 But one thing I know for sure 
 I am a danger to myself, how come 
 Yeah one thing I know for sure 
 I need some guidance, to get me out of this hellhole 
 Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem, yeah 
 It took me quite some time to get into Jerusalem 
 'Cause I had kinda lost my way 
 I want to save me from myself so here I am 
 I hope it's not too late 
 'Cause things ain't what they used to be 
 My love for life is gone you see 
 Am I fighting things I cannot see 
 I am so afraid to love 
 'Cause of the way I've been hurt before 
 I think by now it's time for me to leave 
 But one thing I know for sure 
 I am a danger to myself, how come 
 Yeah one thing I know for sure 
 I need some guidance, to get me out of this hellhole 
 Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
 Jerusalem, can you help me find what I have lost 
 Things ain't what they used to be 
 My love for life is gone you see 
 Am I fighting things I cannot see 
 I don't wanna die this way 
 Wishing that I could turn back time 
 Wasted time, there is work to be done 
 But one thing I know for sure 
 I am a danger to myself, how come 
 Yeah one thing I know for sure 
 I need some guidance, to get me out of this hellhole 
 Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
 Jerusalem, can you help me find what I have lost, yeah yeah 
 All rightI was dreaming last night 
 A figment of my brain 
 On the downtown train 
 And we had nowhere to go 
 So we got off to take a walk 
 In the pouring rain 
 You said you rode it once 
 And you would ride it again 
 Please take me with you 
 Tom waits for the morning train 
 To take us away 
 Me and mr. Tom Waits 
 Can't wait no more 
 I'm wrapped around your finger 
 Two fingers on my lips 
 No need to speak 
 'Cause it's all in our eyes 
 When they turned out the lights 
 They gave us one for the road 
 We headed for the tracks 
 And never looked back 
 This could never be real 
 Tom waits for the morning train 
 To take us away 
 Me and mr. Tom Waits 
 Can't wait no more 
 Can't wait no more 
 On the downtown train 
 Me and mister tom waitsBeneath the burning sky I hold you gently 
 When we watch the sun go down it's heavenly 
 As you begin to cry, I say I love you 
 That we will meet again someday 
 I know it's true 
 As birds fly by, the stars are lighting up tonight 
 Your hand in mine, when we say our last goodbye 
 Fire in the sky 
 Makes me feel so full of peace to feel you with me 
 'Cause we have nothing more to fear, nothing to hope 
 I see you take your one last breath 
 I want you to know that you are free to leave, my love 
 Now let it go 
 As birds fly by, stars are lighting up tonight 
 Your hand in mine, when we say our last goodbye 
 Fire in the sky 
 Hey, hey, hey, fire in the sky 
 Fire in the sky 
 Fire, fire in the skyTomorrow's here a new day rushing by 
 As I try hard to hold onto the light 
 When I feel fine the day is over 
 The saddest thing of it all I don't know why 
 I wanna stay where I am 
 But then I leave 
 I really try to get along 
 And as I walk I think about every little thing 
 That happens to me 
 Don't I know 
 That life's a pack of lies 
 Feels like I am wasting time 
 It makes me cry 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you still like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 I love myself 
 Yeah I'm a star I got it all 
 I am right even when I know I'm wrong 
 It's another crazy day 
 And why won't I shut my mouth for a while 
 And pretend that I haven't lost my mind 
 It's enough to make you cry 
 I'm everything you wanna be 
 As I walk I think about every little thing 
 That happens to me 
 Don't I know that life's a pack of lies 
 Feels like I am wasting time 
 It makes me cry 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you still like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 I set things up to tear them down 
 Scream until it blocks the sound 
 It's how I clear my mind eventually 
 It's my way or no way at all 
 I'm not afraid to lose control 
 Am I someone you would like to be 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 So you think you'd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you still like to try and walk a day in mine8 years just all went down the drain 
 I'll make sure I make it up to you 
 Try not to make the same mistakes again 
 I keep my word and make it work for you 
 So what I'm trying to say is 
 Lay it down 
 There's no way to win this life ain't always fair 
 And once you learn how to play it 
 You still ain't there 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but don't get burned 
 But help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be free 
 Don't worry 'bout how it all went wrong 
 'Cause it won't change the past you see 
 And despite all the things I know 
 There's no place that I would rather be 
 Just hold on 
 What it all comes down to we will be just fine 
 But every now and then you'll find out there's no way 
 Out of this troubled state of mind I say 
 Sometimes you won't understand the way they play 
 But it won't break you 
 (I'm gonna make you believe) 
 I'm gonna make you see 
 You have to love 
 (I'm gonna make you believe) 
 The things that life is giving you my child 
 (I'm gonna make you believe) 
 I'm gonna make you baby make you make you baby 
 (I'm gonna make you believe) 
 And I'll be here to love you 
 There we go 
 There's no way to win this life ain't always fair 
 But ones you learn how to play it 
 You still ain't there 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but baby don't get burned 
 And help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be freeI've been loving you 
 Without even knowing 
 I'll never forget those days 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I haven't seen you since 
 That day 
 I'm sorry baby 
 Baby boy 
 When I saw 
 You the first time 
 I knew right-away that 
 You and I 
 Were connected 
 In a way, yeah, 
 I believed, 
 That there was a way 
 Something more 
 That I could ever express 
 In my own words 
 I Just knew 
 At the time I belonged 
 To you 
 But it all felt so wrong 
 To do the things that 
 My heart gave in baby 
 I'm telling you 
 I've been loving you 
 Without you even knowing 
 I'll never forget 
 Those days 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I haven't seen you since 
 That day 
 I'm sorry babe 
 With loafs on our minds, a few goodbyes 
 We could never 
 Have givin' it 
 A real try 
 But you were in my head always 
 And at this point in my life 
 I just know 
 That if you let me back in 
 I won't let go 
 Of you and me standing at last 
 I just know it's a matter of time 
 Before it all falls back into place, baby believe me 
 I've been loving you 
 Without you even knowing 
 I'll never forget 
 Those days. 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I haven't seen you since 
 That day 
 Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby 
 I've got the light, 
 And for you I will shine. 
 Just be prepared 
 For a hell of a ride 
 Don't ever die 
 By the way 
 I feel for ever seems short 
 I'm begging you 
 Ooooohaah 
 I've been loving you 
 Without you even knowing 
 I'll never forget 
 Those days 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I haven't seen you since that dayWill you fly as fast and free as my love can? 
 Tell me who you are, just let me know 
 That one day you'll be shining your light on me 
 And I'll wait patiently inside the dark 
 Come on love me, I'm telling you I won't be far 
 Some days when I wake before the sunrise 
 Dreaming, wishing I could hold back time, 
 That you might, might never (never) have to live without me 
 And we can see our life in stardust written in the sky 
 I touch the sky, every night I try to find the brightest star 
 You're waiting there for me, so close but still so far 
 One day I will get my wish so I can face the day 
 Guess I've been waiting all my life for you 
 You'll be the one making my dreams come trueI am looking for answeres to questions never posed 
 I haven't got a clue, I'm living like a ghost 
 I can't seem to read the signs 
 I'm swimming in the sand, I'm searching 
 I hold on to your reasons, I'll hold on to my dreams 
 It's all good and bad advice 'cause you have to choose 
 One friend says go ahead, other one says don't 
 I'm searching 
 Whatever I try I can't find it 
 Wherever I roam it's all gone 
 No you can't find it, first you gotta lose it 
 Looking for an angle to change my point of vieuw 
 Waiting for somebody, someone to relate to 
 Hoping for forgiveness, I'm living for love 
 I'm searching 
 Yearning for a teacher, to show me what to do 
 I'm learning from failure, that's all that I can do 
 Working in solutions, a fiction of truth 
 Keep on searching 
 Whatever I try I can't find it 
 Wherever I roam it's all gone 
 No you can't find it, first you gotta lose itYou've got it easy 
 But you've got the nerve to make a face 
 Although I'm strugglin' 
 You can't tell because I keep it caged 
 We are together 
 But I feel you're pushing me aside 
 Lend me a hand sometime 
 The thought won't even cross your mind 
 You needed to take a good look at yourself 
 'Cause I'm about to close up shop 
 If you need a servant go find someone else 
 It's time to step up 
 'Cause If I go 
 I'll be taking more with me than you 
 Would care to lose 
 Time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 Just so you know 
 Nothing you can do could make me 
 Turn around again 
 Your time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 If were together 
 Why you're pushing me away 
 You're taking chances boy 
 We're getting closer to the day 
 You need to take a good look at yourself 
 'Cause I'm about to close up shop 
 If you need a servant go find someone else 
 It's time to step up 
 'Cause If I go 
 I'll be taking more with me than you 
 Would care to lose 
 Time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 Just so you know 
 Nothing you can do could make me 
 Turn around again 
 Your time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 'Cause If I go 
 I'll be taking more with me than you 
 Would care to lose 
 Time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 Just so you know 
 Nothing you can do could make me 
 Turn around again 
 Your time is up step it up 
 Or you'll see me walk away 
 It's time to step up 
 I said it's time to step it up 
 Yeah time to step up 
 Time to step it up 
 I said it's time babe to step it up 
 Step it upFeels like I have a pillow pulled over my head 
 And nearly every night I wake up gasping for air 
 As you slowly die from grief, so you could bury me alive 
 And now I see you suffocate in dreams and your lies 
 Breathe in, gotta breathe out 
 No fear 'cause they won't come around 
 Breathe in, breathe out 
 I'll be all right and lay my burdens down 
 God will you forgive them 
 For they failed the leap of faith 
 Take away the pain that blinds them 
 Teach them how to love instead of hate 
 Don't they see that love's for free 
 Yes, God's got a hold on me 
 Despite the crap you put me through 
 I can say I still got love for you 
 Breathe in, gotta breathe out 
 And don't fear, no they won't come around 
 Breathe in, and breathe out 
 I'll be all right, I'll be all right 
 (Breathe in, breathe out 
 Breathe in and breathe out) 
 I dreamed my faith could overcome my weakness 
 It won't defeat me 
 In my heart gotta have to be this careless 
 Just let me, just let me let me 
 Let me breathe, baby 
 I got to breathe, baby 
 (Let me breathe) 
 I got to breathe, baby 
 (Let me breathe) 
 Let me breathe, baby 
 (Let me breathe) 
 You've gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let me breathe, yeahI beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 Won't you just let go 
 Honey, what you do to me 
 Why you messin' with my man 
 It's not only Mister Right 
 He is also my best friend 
 Must be something I can do 
 To keep him away from you 
 'Cause without him there's no chance 
 I could ever love again 
 Don't you understand, girl 
 Save me 
 Please don't take away my man from me 
 'Cause I just wouldn't know now what to do without him 
 We both know you care, please don't take my man 
 What did you just do to me 
 Stabbing me right in the back, like that 
 Well have you got no dignity 
 I could never do that to you 
 Let alone to you my friend 
 And now you got me thinking 
 Baby, I should take the blame 
 For letting you be such good friends 
 But it never crossed my mind 
 This could happen over time 
 I gotta make you understand 
 Save me 
 Please don't take away my man from me 
 'Cause I just wouldn't know now what to do without him 
 We both know you care, please don't take him, no 
 No, no, no 
 Please don't take him away 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I gotta me you understand, girl 
 Save me 
 Please don't take away my man from me 
 'Cause I just wouldn't know now what to do without him 
 Don't you understand, no, no 
 I beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 I beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 So don't you take him 
 I beg, I cry 
 No, don't take him 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 No, don't take him 
 I beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 I beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 I beg, I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stayLet's say I'm feeling better 
 Let's say I'm feeling fine 
 Let's say I gave you all I had 
 And now I'm out of time 
 And my best wasn't good enough 
 And now there's time to wonder 
 Now there's time to heal 
 Time to let it all come down 
 But I don't know what I feel 
 But it aches and it hurts and it burns 
 Oh it kills me 
 Tick, tock, you don't stop 
 You don't fade 
 You just stay 
 But I'll do it all again 
 Tick, tock, you don't stop 
 You don't fade 
 You just stay 
 But I'll do it all again 
 Now don't you call me baby 
 Just don't pretend you care 
 Save your sorry for yourself 
 When Judas takes you there, oh yeah 
 Once I really believed 
 There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely 
 But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart 
 Says you're not the only one 
 But it kills me 
 Tick, tock, you don't stop 
 You don't fade 
 You just stay 
 But I'll do it all again 
 Tick, tock, you don't stop 
 You don't fade 
 You just stay 
 But I'll do it all againMourning through thoughts of you 
 My heavy heart 
 Can't find my way around 
 It's morning when it starts 
 You and I wanted love, somewhere down the line 
 (You and I) All of the things that we've been through 
 (Don't you know) Deep down you know that I love you 
 (That by know) If you don't know that by now then 
 I might have to leave 
 Baby, you're telling me that I'm no good, and I don't even care 
 You make it so hard for me, to love you back in any way I can 
 Many times I am failing you, cannot give what I want you 
 And if you ride my side, my heart is made of stone 
 Then I'm better of alone 
 Building up barricades, day by day 
 Leaving me paralyzed, selfish and afraid 
 I am not who I was, I got broken deep inside 
 (Make it feel) I make you feel left out alone 
 (All alone) You need a place you can call home 
 (Need a home) What if I'm finding out now 
 I can't do that anymore 
 Baby, you're telling me that I'm no good, and I don't even care 
 You make it so hard for me, to love you back, the only way I can 
 Many times I am failing you, cannot give what I want you 
 And if you ride my side, my heart is made of stone 
 Then I'm better of alone 
 (I'm trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay) 
 But it doesn't work that way 
 (I'm trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay) 
 But I am so afraid, hey, so afraid, so afraid, baby, oeeh 
 Baby you're telling me that I'm no good and I don't even care 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I canBaby, why you're so sad 
 What's the thing you're running from 
 Caught in the red lights 
 As if money is the cure 
 Is this your only way to survive 
 Are you trying to get even with the past 
 What happened to the dreams you had 
 I think it's time for you to 
 Show them you are able 
 To leave without saying one word 
 I know it won't be easy, baby 
 But I will run with you 
 'Cause every night has a day 
 Every wish a prayer 
 Don't lose your faith 
 And I'll be holding your hand 
 'Cause it's never too late 
 There's someone who needs you 
 So break down that wall, baby 
 There's a new world out there waiting 
 Just tear down that wall, girl 
 Run away and don't look back 
 Break down that wall 
 Break down that wall 
 There's someone who needs you 
 Lady it's your turn now 
 Just walk the streets with your head up high 
 Oh baby doesn't that feel right 
 So put a big smile on your face 
 You walk on straight 
 Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong 
 Isn't this your sweetest revenge 
 Feels good, hey I told you so 
 'Cause every night has a day 
 Every wish has a prayer 
 Don't lose your faith 
 And I'll be holding your hand 
 'Cause it's never too late 
 There's someone who needs you 
 So break down that wall, baby 
 There's a new world out there waiting 
 Just tear down that wall, girl 
 Run away and don't look back 
 Break down that wall 
 Break down that wall 
 So break down that wall, baby 
 There's a new world out there 
 Tear down that wall, girl 
 Run away run away run away 
 Break down that wall 
 Break down that wall 
 'Cause I need youHeaded for the heartache 
 You took my love and broke it 
 Torn it and provoked it 
 As I trusted 
 Your charming little ways 
 And all those lies of praise 
 What have you done 
 What have you done 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 How did you trick me 
 Into loving you 
 You're like poison on my soul 
 Was it worth it 
 You pushed it way too far 
 Speading rumours about my heart 
 Hey it ain't right 
 No it ain't right 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 And I will blame it all on you 
 For I will never dance again 
 The way I did when you were my man 
 Don't be calling me 
 You're messing with my head 
 I'm so angry but instead 
 I still want more 
 Inspite of all the lies 
 The phony alibis you've given my heart 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 And I will blame it all on you 
 For I will never dance again 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 And I will blame it all on you 
 For I will never dance again 
 The way I did when you were my manIsolated from the outside 
 Clouds have taken all the light 
 I have no control, it seems my 
 Thoughts wander all of the time 
 When I try to 
 Live life without you 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 No air, no pride 
 If being myself is what I do wrong 
 Then I would rather not be right 
 Hopes turned into fear and with my 
 One wing I can't fly 
 With sunrise, embrace my 
 Dreams tight and that's why 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 No air, no pride 
 Birds 
 To a place without fear, with no moonlight 
 (To a place without moonlight and fear) 
 All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight 
 (All I need is trees, some flowers and sunlight) 
 Where memories are being made 
 And where the old one dies 
 Where love ain't lost 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 No air, no pride 
 That's why birds don't flyI know the drill 
 You've got your ball and chain 
 It holds you down the circle round 
 This story stays the same 
 It won't be long 
 And then your heart is frozen 
 The time has come to break away 
 You've got it all 
 What makes you hesitate? 
 Don't just wait for things to blow up 
 In your pretty face 
 Lift the weight 
 Try not to let it slip away 
 And you may find yourself again 
 I feel 
 People just don't know you like I do 
 Why you're making it so hard to see 
 When there's something wrong 
 It goes on and on 
 I know the drill 
 You've got your ball and chain 
 I found out the second round 
 That some things never change 
 Open my eyes 
 And let the days come over me 
 And maybe it'll go away 
 I feel 
 People just don't know you like I do 
 Why you're making it so hard to see 
 When there's something wrong 
 On and on and on You'll see 
 Not everybody's here to 
 Break your heart 
 So there is a price to pay 
 To be someone you're not 
 I know the drill you've got your ball and chain 
 I found out the second round 
 That some things never change 
 Open my eyes 
 And let the days come over me 
 And maybe it'll go awayGraduated fool, that is what I am 
 For every time I failed you 
 You're so beautiful, I just turned and walked away 
 I jingle with words, tangle my tongue 
 Stammering stutters 
 So I wrote you this song, to finally tell you 
 What you've know all along, I love you 
 Believe in me, believe me 
 It was true devotion, now these mixed emotions 
 Oh, I did it again 
 I want you to forgive me, when the pain has faded 
 We'll be laughing again 
 Believe in me 
 Graduated fool, I'm better than I am 
 For that is what you made me 
 Please, hold back your tears 
 I didn't deserve you anyway 
 Believe in me, I still care for you, believe me 
 Just believe in me, believe me 
 When I kiss your face again, all these mixed emotions 
 Of pleasure and pain 
 I want you to forgive me, when the pain has faded (yeah) 
 We'll be laughing again (and again and again) 
 Believe in me, you're so beautiful, believe me 
 Just believe in me, believe meDo I really want to know myself 
 Do I want to see 
 Why I'm wonderin' every morning 
 Who's it gonna be today 
 Staring in the mirror 
 Come tell me, who's that under my skin 
 And what's the reason we're here for 
 Tell me what is my own true face 
 Tell me what is my own true face 
 But hey here I come 
 I'm the show's main attraction 
 I'm a beautiful creature 
 Yeah that's what I am 
 Yeah that's what I am 
 But the other side of me 
 I can't explain why I've become 
 Negative as can be, oh yeah 
 I'm wonderin' where it's coming from 
 I know I can't do without it 
 Sure makes me what I am 
 So I will never stop believin' 
 In that I love myself someday 
 In that I love myself someday 
 But hey here I come 
 I'm the show's main attraction 
 I'm a beautiful creature 
 Yeah that's what I am 
 Yeah that's what I am 
 Hey that's what I am 
 Yeah, oh yeahHaven't we both heard enough babe 
 This is what we're gonna do 
 Let me put my arms around you once more 
 There's nothing left here to prove 
 Walk away just a little bit slower 
 Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go 
 Break through to the other side 
 I keep wondering 
 When were you ever gonna let me know 
 That you just wanted something else in life 
 What do you say when it's all over 
 What do you know when nothing's going right 
 The troubles in your mind 
 What do you do when you get lost inside your soul 
 Where do you go when love's gone 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 It was so hard when I watched you falling down 
 But it was time for you to walk alone 
 Just know if you really need a friend 
 And you're feeling like you can't go on 
 Just walk back just a little bit faster 
 Take my hand I will blow your fears away 
 Break through to the other side 
 For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else 
 And I'll be by your side 
 What do you say when it's all over 
 What do you do when it's all gone 
 What do you do when you get lost inside your soul 
 Where do we go when love's gone 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 When it all becomes reality 
 That this is where it ends for you and me 
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 Will love find a way on time 
 Please don't try and kiss these tears away 
 We know we've both have made mistakes 
 If I could do it all again 
 I wouldn't change a single thing 
 What do you say when it's all over 
 What do you do when it's all gone 
 What do you do when you get lost inside your soul 
 Where do we go when love's gone 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 What do you say nothing at all
