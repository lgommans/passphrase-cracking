Look at you how far you came 
 Here from where it all started 
 You havent changed you stayed the same 
 So strong and bravehearted 
 And you would never ask for more 
 You make a difference in peoples lives 
 I have said it all before 
 So many other times 
 Im sure your daddy would be proud of you 
 If he could see the good things that you do 
 Youre just like twins so much alike 
 Im sure he would have loved you 
 Each and every day he would have made sure 
 That you would feel safe and be alright 
 In spite of pain and broken hearts 
 And all the weight on your shoulders 
 Youll survive just where you are 
 Even when it gets colder 
 Regardless of your longtime fears 
 You have the power to soothe your soul 
 The way you smile behind your tears 
 I wish he could see it all 
 Just like twins so much alike 
 Im sure he just would have loved you 
 And he would tell you 
 Always be proud of who you are 
 Dont let anyone put you down 
 Happy I always Im going to heaven 
 But just remember remember remember 
 Im sure my daddy would be proud of you 
 Just remember remember remember 
 If he would see the good things that you doRrrrrraaawwrr 
 This is the way 
 Well to get her 
 To get her together 
 Rrrrrraaawwrr 
 Pickin up the pieces 
 Break it down and bring it up 
 Pick it up and get her together 
 This is the way this is the way 
 This is how we get her together 
 Togetgetget to get her together 
 Togegegegegegegether 
 Pick it up and get her togetherIve got a bug in my head and a jumping heart 
 No time to spare 
 Turn left turn right step on it 
 Stopped by the traffic light 
 And all that honking screaming 
 The cabdriver is dreaming 
 Of the beach and babes 
 Leaning back easy as the sun goes down 
 But Im already late 
 Couldnt care less about it 
 If the sky was falling down 
 No I dont care you can stare 
 While the whole world is crumbling around me 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking me down 
 So youve got a lot of stuff on your mind 
 Or a bleeding heart when nobody cares 
 Step in step out of the rain 
 Head for the flickering lights just head for the flickering lights 
 Theres always somebody dancing baby taking a chance 
 You can find a little romance someone will give you love 
 Although its just enough 
 To get you through the night 
 Well alright now 
 I dont care about it 
 Urban solitude shaking us down 
 Urban solitudeI might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well cheating on you 
 I always knew that you would be 
 Cheating on me finally 
 I never knew it be this soon 
 I didnt see it comin 
 Yesterday you let me down 
 The only friend I thought I found 
 Sleepless nights heart in two 
 Baby who was kissing you 
 If this would have happened to me 
 Ten years ago 
 Id make sure that youd be lying 
 Six feet underground 
 But little girls we grow up 
 Knowing love will find a way 
 So now we have an understanding 
 I cant see why I 
 Might as well 
 Be cheating on you 
 I might as well 
 Do all the things you do 
 Have a little fun 
 Baby you inspire 
 Its the way we carry on 
 Heavy steal is all you see 
 That is what is left to me 
 No remorse no dignity 
 Can we get any higher 
 To every other happy fool 
 Disloyalty will come for you 
 Lights go out on your own 
 So much for pretending 
 Now if this would have happened to me 
 Lets just rock and roll 
 Have you ever been in love before 
 And does it matter 
 Cause nothing ever seems to be 
 The way it should be 
 Tell me why 
 Dont you love me like the 
 Way you used to do 
 It might be worthwhile 
 To take a step back and ask 
 Yourself how this is gonna last 
 When its all a lie 
 Now here me out 
 I swear to God that this 
 Is something I will not forget 
 Ye yeah 
 Ye yeah 
 Oh ooh 
 I might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well be cheating on you I doThe black side of my mind is getting weaker 
 The black side of my soul is getting white 
 This time Ill try and dig a little deeper 
 So I can change the wrongs into whats right 
 Dark were the days when our life was gone 
 Those were the days when fear of death came along 
 Let us get rid of this 
 Dark were the nights when I did not fight 
 Those were the nights when dark told me whats right 
 I did it all for love 
 Why havent I had enough 
 Leave it alone because in time 
 Walking away with nothing but 
 Pain in my heart for what weve lost 
 Try to stand tall with my head held high 
 The dark makes it hard for you to see 
 I gave it all for you and me 
 In time I will be ready to believe 
 Dark were the thoughts running through our minds 
 Those were the thoughts dragging me further down 
 What will you do for love 
 When is it ever enough 
 Leave it alone because in timeI dont exist for you 
 You made that crystal clear 
 Your sweetest thing for 7 years 
 What did I do to deserve this 
 Dont think you own my life 
 Ive still got my pride 
 Trying so hard to forget 
 I cannot help but hear your voice 
 This is love just trust me baby 
 Other girls mean nothing to me 
 Why dont you keep your big mouth shut 
 And all the bridges that you burn 
 Come back one day to haunt you 
 Its just a matter of time 
 Baby dont get me wrong 
 If Im not there to catch your fall 
 Did I try for too long 
 Am I to blame for you being you 
 Save those tears for someone else 
 Your troubles only just begun 
 Hands off my sunshine leave it alone 
 Before I go commit a crime 
 Im gonna show you what you taught me 
 No respect no mercy 
 Till you fall down on your knees for me 
 All the bridges that you burn 
 Am I to blame for you being youI dont want no trouble baby 
 I just wanted you to see 
 That I can get you much better love 
 Ill be that bitch shell never be 
 I aint no homewrecker but you deserve that killer bee honey 
 Ill give it up for anything but easy 
 Let me reply its got to be me 
 You cant imagine what I am going through 
 And all those ladies stop and stare at you 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now lets get higher 
 Because Im the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Walk down here baby 
 Leave it all up to me 
 While I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it youll be begging me on your knees 
 Cause I got the fire yeah 
 When it comes to making love 
 Yeah Im the one youre looking for 
 But dont you waste all of your time 
 Come over here before Ill change my mind 
 Ill take you higher 
 Yeah I am the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Cause I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it that youll be begging me on your knees 
 Ooh yeah 
 I will make you cry for more 
 Higher higher higher 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Come on and get it 
 Because I got the fire and youd put it on me 
 Im taking you higher 
 Im readyNo hurry Ill be waiting for you My baby 
 Now dont you worry 
 Ill be fine 
 Just take your time 
 To make up your mind 
 Draw a line 
 Or flip a dime 
 Waiting for you 
 Its easy 
 If you want to please me 
 Dont tell me maybe 
 Come back home complete me 
 No strings attached 
 Thats a promise I cant keep 
 So I waste my time 
 With lazy crazy dreaming 
 A sparkling wine 
 A twist of lime 
 A whisky soda hole in time 
 When youre not here 
 Dont say youre sorry 
 Dont say it 
 No 
 Dont say youre sorryCold blackhearted golddiggers 
 I guess that too much generosity 
 Is making people take you for a fool 
 And at every opportunity 
 Theyll even try to get some more from you 
 So theyll cheat and lie 
 But I will let God deal with the things they do 
 Cause when they get their hands on all that gold and paper 
 They forget to say thank you 
 But will money bring the things they want 
 And does it solve the problems that they face 
 Cause when everything is said and done 
 They will find out its another day 
 Full of emptiness and lies 
 And they can grab as much as they can 
 But it will never buy them one seat in heaven 
 Oh when money rules them 
 Let me tell you 
 Moneys never bought me anything 
 I said nothing no nothing at all 
 I said nothing baby 
 Nothing nothing nothing at allThe things you say 
 In your innocent way 
 Remind me how it should be 
 Your love I can trace 
 In a wide open space 
 Oh your beautiful face I have seen 
 Its the way you walk 
 And the way that you talk to me 
 Youre Gods gift to my world 
 The prettiest girl 
 And it feels like I live a dream 
 The silence I fear 
 Preach to the morning sun 
 So just hold me now 
 Ill stay here all night cause I 
 Dont feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight love 
 The things you do and say 
 Always go hand in hand 
 Youre all you seem to be 
 Not a shred of you pretends 
 I will run like a fool 
 Just to be by your side 
 Dont hold back my love 
 Youre my joy in this sad sad world 
 You are safe with me 
 Dream and you will be free 
 Ill stay here all night cause II 
 Holding me tight love 
 Just hold me now 
 And if I could have it my way 
 Id tell you to stay here always 
 I will be waiting for you 
 Ill be waiting and theres nothing else I can do 
 Youve taken me over 
 Holding me tight loveWhatever you say babe 
 Dont you know 
 Im not afraid because 
 I know just where to go 
 Im loving you babe 
 All the time 
 I know that love will find a place for 
 You and I 
 I know I should have called you first 
 But I couldnt stop myself from driving to 
 You just to see 
 You smiling makes me wanna be with you 
 Is that all right 
 Boy I just cant help myself 
 And thats the reason why 
 Whatever you say babe 
 Well 
 Im driving in my car the music plays 
 The way you make me feel its like 
 Im walking on air 
 Ill make you believe again that lovers do stay 
 And every now and then we fight 
 Without walking away 
 Baby you just drive me crazy 
 Forget the world 
 For a while 
 Doesnt matter 
 Gotta have you 
 In my arms 
 That is were Ill stay 
 Baby baby baby baby babyI love you baby 
 Who will I have to be 
 For you to be the one 
 So we can start a fire 
 Until the day comes 
 Ill be waiting here 
 If it takes forever 
 I will look to see 
 What lies ahead of me 
 Oh baby when I hear your voice 
 Youre leaving me breathless 
 Youre giving me no other choice 
 So baby Ill just let you know 
 Im keepin my heart for later 
 Keepin my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until its you and I 
 Anywhere you wander 
 Anywhere you go 
 I promise I will stay 
 Boy I love you so 
 There will be a time 
 When all the waitings done 
 And doubts will disappear 
 They will be one by one 
 Its leaving me breathless 
 So baby I just let you know 
 Keepin my heart for later 
 Do you feel me baby 
 Im keepin my soul alive 
 Until its you and II spy I spy a tear in your eye 
 So Ill try Ill try to get you out of here 
 You sigh just move a little closer 
 Time flies soon the night is over 
 Morning noon night all day 
 All I ever wanted was for you to come my way 
 Weve got time so let it slide 
 Roll me over get on top

 And make an end to my lonely

 I want you to tell me Im still in your heart 
 More than the day before 
 Theres gotta be something that I can do 
 Thatll make you love me more 
 Better not wipe us out today 
 Once upon a dream the memories meant nothing 
 And now theyre all that I have left today 
 We started up as friends thinking this would never end 
 But you had to throw it all away 
 All away 
 Come on 
 Dont wipe us out wipe us out baby 
 Youd better not wipe us out tod 
 Gotta be something baby 
 Gotta gotta be something I can do now 
 Hey now baby 
 Dont you do that to usA taste of breath a kiss sweater than honey 
 Your eyes in a misty dream a million miles away 
 And in my ear you whisper my name 
 Just like in some old news flash 
 From light years ago 
 Van Dykes on the slide trombone 
 Through the smoke of the party room 
 Your teeth like the ivory coast 
 Start singin my favourite song 
 And it happen to be mood indigo 
 Mood indigo 
 I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 Could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Take off my make up 
 Holding on to my heart 
 Smokin them downhill 
 In a room number thirteen 
 Tryin to stretch my luck again 
 Down the corridor your footsteps echo against the wall 
 My man of mystery my date with infinity 
 Tonight Im gonna sacrifice for the first time in my life 
 Make it all come back to me like an old forgotten dream 
 Mood indigo I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 It could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Completely lost in my mood indigoGirl girl girl 
 When I hear him talk 
 Ooh my mind gets blocked girl 
 Speak up cause my jaw is locked 
 Which is good good for me girl 
 It hides like a warning sign 
 But Im too blind to see 
 Speak up yes Im coming down 
 With an ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever 
 Still got my hands theyre clinging 
 So I just keep going 
 I dont know where I belong 
 Could I belong to you 
 No I dont know where I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Girl girl girl 
 Get it while its hot they say 
 You see Im burning up here 
 I want to but I just cant stop 
 And it hurts 
 It hurts like hell girl 
 You turn me inside out and upside down 
 Ooh you got me head over heels 
 Im stuck yes Im coming down 
 Ice cold fever aha 
 Oh girl yeah I belong 
 To you you you 
 To you yeah you 
 Yeah I belong to you 
 Say you yeah you 
 Alright 
 Hey 
 HeyYeah 
 Now I believe 
 That what I used to think 
 Was a lie 
 Is really a life 
 Now I can see 
 Theres only one place to reach 
 Only one thing to preach 
 And thats the highest 
 Its the strangest thing 
 That I can feel so much 
 There is no reason 
 There is no logic to feelings 
 Cause when love is the dealer Im addicted 
 So fascinating 
 I cant stop this constant craving 
 Youre contagious 
 That I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 Its the strangest thing that 
 I can feel 
 And I cannot hide 
 Even if I try 
 You mean everything to me 
 Any fool can see 
 What youve done to me 
 And when youre not here 
 I just cry hey hey 
 I could die 
 Yet the best is still to come dear 
 Yet the best is still to come 
 For us 
 Oh the best is still to come 
 And I cannot hide even if I try 
 Any fool can see what youve done to me 
 I just cry 
 And when yourre not here 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeahIm gonna get out of my shell 
 Try without anybodys help 
 To lose this heavy load 
 And get my life back on the road 
 Ive seen the worst when I was down 
 Only loneliness I found 
 Now Im climbing to the top 
 And I aint never gonna stop 
 Ill carry on though the road is long 
 Im gonna get myself together 
 And Ill hold on cause I am strong 
 Gonna try to make it better baby 
 The rest of my life Ill take these chances 
 Time goes by so very fast 
 Ill share my fortune and my failure 
 Till theres nothing left 
 And if somewhere down the line 
 Ill find Im running out of time 
 I hope to god that I can say 
 I made the best of every day 
 Till then Ill carry on though the road is long 
 Im gonna try to make it better baby 
 Till theres nothing leftIts a shame the rules change not the game 
 Such a shame Its the same 
 Now everything is in vain 
 All in vain its such a shame 
 Could it be true that theres nothing left to do 
 For me and you cant be true 
 We all cant be such fools 
 Could life be so cruel 
 Maybe I dont even try fearing what Id find 
 Guess I am a number on the line 
 Could you please tell me why 
 Were on the same line and were fallin behind 
 On life 
 Life is great Im walking in the sun and everything is cool 
 Yeah its true theres so much we can do 
 It feels so right 
 Yeah its all right 
 Baby I dont even wanna try fearing what Id find 
 Could you please tell me why were on the same line and 
 Fallin behind 
 Fallin behind on lifeIts funny how I blind myself 
 So I dont have to see 
 Theyre taking me down and bringing me to my knees 
 Letting me know Im alone 
 Not afraid to die no more 
 The house above 
 Heaven wont you pick me up now 
 Love all I needed was love 
 Someone give me some love 
 I guess its only meant for some of us 
 Life has made me lose my mind 
 Im not doing all right these days 
 Lying naked on my kitchen floor 
 So cold well I thought I had a lions heart 
 I guess I was wrong 
 I feel so damn lonely 
 Love all I needed was some love 
 Could someone give me some sweet loving 
 Cause this is more than I can bear 
 My nights are getting darker as time goes by 
 How Ive tried to keep these walls from falling down 
 One way or another they shut me downWere breaking things we cant repair 
 None of us will take the blame 
 No nothing can be done this time 
 All the memories that weve made 
 I threw them all away 
 Theres no need to talk it over 
 Dont let me get you down 
 Lets just move on 
 I am setting you free 
 Cause I dont wanna hurt no more 
 I dont wanna make you go 
 Through one more rainy day 
 No I dont wanna hurt no more 
 Strange enough I always knew 
 Im taking off today 
 Dont wanna hurt no more 
 The darkness you left in my soul 
 Do we know how much weve lost 
 Will the moon be shining as bright as before 
 And as Im singing this song 
 The tears well up in my eyes I will always wonder 
 Why I will never have the life I wanted 
 Now Im letting it go 
 No I dont wanna make you go 
 Theres not much more to say 
 Its too late now 
 I wont hurt no more 
 So I wait till morning comes 
 Youve made it clear that is has been 
 Only pain lovin me 
 Things that we wont do for love 
 I am letting you goSittin on the beach the island king of love 
 Deep in fijian seas deep in some blissful dream 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps in the lap of her lover 
 Subdued in all her rage 
 And Im aglow with the taste of the demons driven out 
 And happily replaced with the presence of real love 
 The only one who saves 
 I wanna dance with you 
 I see a world where people live and die with grace 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 The stillness in your eyes convinces me that i 
 I dont know a thing 
 And Ive been around the world and Ive tasted all the winds 
 A half a billion times 
 Came sickened to your shores you show me what this life is for 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 In this altered state in this altered state 
 Full of so much pain and rage 
 You know we got to find a way 
 To let it go 
 To let it go to let it go to let it go 
 Sittin on the beach the island king of love 
 Deep in fijian seas deep in the heart of it all 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps after eons of war 
 And lifetimes shes smilin 
 And free nothin left 
 But a cracking voice and a song oh lord 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 We would not face we would not face 
 We would not face we would not faceIm just thinkin about the child in me 
 That I sometimes feel inside 
 And Im figuring out just what it is 
 That makes me feel so small 
 Is it you that hurts me when I give myself 
 Every day and every night 
 Am I too blind to see that it doesnt work out 
 Did I really ask too much of you baby 
 Do you mean to tell me thats the way it is 
 Do you mean to say 
 Its all so hard Its so hard 
 As I search for an answer I see the clear blue sky 
 And I know that youre the one to blame 
 And I feel so nave 
 When you say that our love to you was just a game 
 I dream my dream Im sane Im insane 
 Oh please dont please dont speak to me that way 
 Damned its so hard why youre so hard 
 Why youre so hard Its tearing me apartDont kill that man dont kill that man 
 He could be the one that brings you gifts for Christmas 
 Dont kill that man dont kill that man 
 He could be the one for free without the dullness 
 This could be great 
 Dont just let go 
 He might be the one to know 
 The way you should be loved 
 A few words are enough 
 To lighten up your days when shadows fade away 
 But Im not sure hes safe 
 No Im not sure yet 
 He could be the one to trust when youve been lied to 
 Dont kill him yet dont kill him yet 
 He could be the one you can turn your blind eye to 
 This is pure gut 
 He could be that man who knows 
 He could be the oneMake it rain 
 Right behind that perfect face 
 Theres someone who keeps 
 Secrets hidden well 
 Think I dont want to know 
 Reasons why youre crashing over me 
 I dont look back 
 Darling so it goes 
 But I regret 
 We couldnt 
 Make it rain 
 And all our dreams were left to dry 
 Cant Make it rain 
 Theres not one cloud left in the sky 
 You say you tried 
 We bled weve cried 
 We couldnt make it rain 
 We had everything to live for 
 Even if we didnt understand 
 The game of give and take 
 Was more than just the sum 
 Of what we make 
 The most of time 
 So well move on 
 And leave it all behind 
 Cause we couldnt 
 Now I cant help thinking about 
 Places we would go 
 But I wont be around no more 
 But this fault wont be mine 
 Everything is gone 
 Cant make it rain 
 Theres not one cloud left in the sky so 
 All our dreams were left to dry 
 We bled we cried 
 You said you tried 
 We bled weve criedRule number one there will be no rules 
 Rule number two thats for you 
 Rule number three when in doubt theres the door 
 Rule number four tell me more 
 No lies no tricks of any kind 
 Be true love hard show inside 
 And I will absolutely love you 
 Rule number five make sure Gods on your side 
 Rule number six it will never be fixed in the mix 
 Rule number seven leave no space in between 
 And heres number eight just be real not make believe 
 When shadows appear show me the power to shine 
 Travel the world all around 
 Laying the troubles downIts not what I needed or what I wanted but then again 
 Living a lie I couldnt go on another day 
 There must have been a way to busy adoring you 
 Its over oh oh 
 I hear hello holding on my phone and I cant recall 
 That I ever felt this sad in my whole life before 
 My blood runs cold and honestly 
 I feel lonely baby so lonely baby 
 These days are just way to bright 
 I need a reason to believe 
 Cause I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I aint the one youre looking for 
 Oeh why do I keep telling myself 
 And letting me know that I aint the one you need no 
 Were talking all night to a filthy sky and some rain 
 Im tryin to find just little bits of yesterday 
 I guess you never knew how much I needed you ooh 
 Its over 
 And handle it covering my eye so I can see 
 Somethings angels always what they seem to be 
 Things in my mind keep flashing by 
 Whats going on what the hell is going on 
 I need a reason to believe yeah 
 Ooh why do I keep telling myself 
 Ooh hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Ooh no 
 Were living a lie baby oh 
 Were living a lie baby 
 Were living a lie now 
 Lie now heey hehehehe 
 Hehehehe 
 Were living a lie 
 Were living a lie hey 
 Were living a lie babyYou come around telling me you dont need me no more 
 You say it is all about to end 
 If you got nothing more to say then shut your pie hole 
 Just walk away and leave me lonely 
 Cause theres no time to waste 
 For me to have a taste 
 Of all the other pretty men whore waiting out there 
 For me to give them all my lovin 
 Now theres no doubt about it this girl still got it 
 Yeah Im on fire give me something 
 Now theres no time to waste 
 For me to have it all 
 Know where we gotta go 
 Down where the water falls 
 Now walk on to the bay 
 Where I take off all my clothes 
 Hey baby what do you say 
 Well have you ever met a girl this sexy like me before 
 So when I woke up there were 3 of us this morning 
 You sure know how to treat me well 
 Dont want no flowers dont need love and understanding 
 This time its all about myself 
 Cause all this time around 
 Yeah Ive been missing out 
 On a lot of love and affection 
 Ill hand you all directions 
 On how to walk on to the bay 
 Have you ever met a girl this hot like me before 
 Just walk on the bay 
 Where we take off all our clothes 
 Ooh baby let me hear you say 
 I have never ever met a girl this juicy like you beforeI look at the ground its filled with lies 
 When you got lost I got so lonely 
 Give it time dont move on 
 Let it dry times passing by so slowly 
 Border lie face Ill keep it straight 
 Cause no one knows I only have dark days 
 New love no use 
 Pain in my face pretending as always 
 And these are the bright days 
 In my dreams Ill make you want me 
 One more time the sun will shine 
 Cause they wont love you like I loved you 
 You still make me cry 
 Grief makes numb every day 
 How does it come I get lost on the speedway 
 No joy or delight 
 Just prove me to bed so I can shut my eyes tight 
 Did you love him like you know you should 
 I was in it for the long run 
 Will you ever feel the same again 
 Theres no turning back cause my heart is long gone 
 Theres no turning back 
 No they wont love you like Ive loved you 
 You still make me crySurely I am willing but I wont 
 Claiming that Ill do it but I dont 
 Knowing Ill do anything you want 
 Pretending I am someone that Im not 
 Good God my mind 
 Wont let me think right 
 I know youre trouble 
 But Im determined to create 
 These things up in my head 
 That never happen 
 In time Ive gotta choose 
 Freedom or loyalty 
 Look at what you have done 
 What am I gonna do 
 So now that you have made a mess of me 
 And showed me stars that 
 I have never seen 
 I know its wrong why does it feel so right 
 You havent got me yet 
 But you might 
 Youre smiling back at me 
 I wanna do it 
 I wanna be with you 
 Let me get through it 
 Am I gonna make it back alive 
 When you show me all the things that you can do 
 That never happened 
 What am I gonna doAnother day is here another drama will appear 
 And I think its time that I gave my mind a break 
 Im feeling used and abused and misunderstood 
 I gotta find me a place 
 Where theres no one else around 
 Every time I see you walking away 
 My heads spinning around 
 No I never feel the same 
 I didnt know what I had baby till it was gone 
 No nothing even matters even matters at all to me 
 No more 
 I aint done much lately 
 Sleeping and staring at the wall 
 Watchin TV 
 And even though Im down still 
 I have faith in my moon 
 Well I said hey get rid of it 
 Photographs of you here in my room 
 Reminding my heart and soul that I still love you 
 Whenever Im with you its wearing me out 
 No matter what you do youre the one I love 
 Now baby where did we go 
 Did we give it a chance 
 Cause everything is about to go down tonight 
 And as I said before 
 And while youre out there in search of you 
 And try to keep it all together 
 Where were you when I needed you 
 Well I said hey get rid of itCan you tell me how you feel 
 When you turn on your tv 
 When you see me singing through my tears 
 Ive saved up all these years 
 Can you tell me what you see 
 When you read the magazines 
 Do you see yourself in me 
 When the DJ plays this song 
 Can you tell me what you hear 
 And I hope you feel the way we felt 
 When you put us all through hell 
 Can you tell me how you feel now 
 How do you feel how do you feel 
 Tell me how you sleep at night 
 Do you take those pills like me 
 Or do you toss and turn 
 And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep 
 Cause you just dont care 
 How do you feel 
 And now Im in your face 
 And you feel that empty space 
 Why did we how did we come to fall from grace 
 Falling falling 
 Didnt you just hear us calling out 
 No theres nothing left to say 
 Cause you shouldnt have stayed away 
 No man leaves his flesh and blood this way 
 How do feel how do you feel 
 Cause you just dont care 
 It took a crowd for me to see 
 That it really wasnt me 
 The swaying crowd is the cleansing rain 
 It took the pain away 
 And I hope youll find yourself alone 
 In a million dollar home 
 You will be stuck 
 With a heart like a rock 
 I hope you run out of luck fool 
 How do you feel now 
 Does it hurt does it hurt 
 Does it hurt baby 
 Im just wonderin how it feels 
 Just wonderin 
 Does it hurtSure got my piece of heaven 
 An angel in disguise 
 Gone wild 
 But I thought you were a man 
 Who knew right from wrong 
 Thats why I really dont understand 
 Why hes with her 
 Its killing me 
 What has she got that I dont have 
 Is it the way she looks at you 
 Laughs with you can she 
 Does she make you beg for more 
 This is hurting 
 I tried to call him 
 Anytime anywhere 
 But hes never there 
 So I went to his place 
 And waited all day 
 So he would explain it to me 
 And this is what he said 
 There is nothing left to say 
 I had my fill I went away 
 Your crying eyes wont change a thing 
 It was just a fling 
 Well how could an angel break my heart 
 He said We could still be friends 
 Are you kidding me 
 Talks to you can she 
 But twice every year 
 When hes in tears 
 When he loses his mind 
 And cant help but cry 
 Hell call me and then 
 I am better than I am xSo many times Ive cried 
 When dark clouds block the sunlight 
 And its raining in my heart 
 Ill keep my head up high 
 So little time to try 
 To find out about the feeling 
 Thats deep inside of you 
 And keeps the dream alive 
 So remember 
 When youre down and out 
 In the sand 
 So many minds are torn 
 By overloading senses 
 Youre breathing in and out 
 No second left to sigh 
 Nobody will tell me 
 What theyre feeling deep inside 
 Were all just telling lies 
 Every time you wonder 
 Why the feeling lingers 
 And its stuck inside your soul 
 Youre crying when you smile 
 When youre stuck in the middle 
 When you cant solve the riddle 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 When you cant help but shiver 
 Get you finger off the trigger 
 Get it out your head 
 Out of your hands 
 When everythings missing 
 And theres nobody listening 
 Lay it down 
 In the sandWhat about those songs you sang my love 
 Were they meant for her 
 And all those words you never said before 
 What about those kisses in my sleep 
 Tomorrow will be fine 
 Yeah just a little while 
 Oh no this aint no way to live 
 Cause I will be 
 Watching every step scared I wont find you again 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away 
 Ill be watching every step scared I wont find you again 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself yeah 
 What about that bracelet in your car 
 Was it meant for her 
 I am more than you deserve 
 Why couldnt you just lie suicide 
 Why couldnt you just lie 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself 
 Dont you waste my time suicide suicide 
 Dont you waste my time suicide yeah 
 I am more than you deserveHey Michel hows life are you ok 
 I wonder if you ever think of me 
 Its been 9 years since that kiss 
 I can help but reminisce 
 Hey Michel do you remember 
 We walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand you and me 
 Smiling faces so in love 
 Hoping that they all could see 
 That we belong together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way cause it wasnt meant to be 
 Now its you and her I see 
 You were my first and worst love 
 And so it only could go wrong 
 But aint that just the way you learn 
 Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know 
 That someone else has stolen my heart 
 And now another girl has caught your eye 
 That doesnt mean I dont think of you 
 I am just hoping that shell treat you right 
 Do you remember 
 How we walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand and you and me 
 That we belonged together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way cause it wasnt meant to be 
 Now it is you and her I see 
 It was just a silly dream 
 Hey Michel do you rememberI feel completely disconnected from the world Im living in 
 I try to understand the way Im thinking 
 Keep all options open Id rather wait and see 
 Whats gonna happen next 
 Yeah I like to wait and see 
 Yeah I like to wait 
 I choke on all the information 
 That keeps getting thrown at me 
 How do you decide what to do 
 With all the complications all the doubts 
 Do you want it with or without 
 So now you just wait and see hey 
 Now you just wait 
 Please dont be mad 
 But I already miss you 
 It doesnt matter anyway 
 I hope you missed your your runaway train 
 I wake to find myself asleep 
 Weiry of life 
 I laugh Ill moan Ill cry 
 And Ill try not to wait 
 No dont be mad 
 Cause I already miss you 
 Lets hope you missed your your runaway train 
 Your runaway train 
 But anyway 
 I already miss you yeah 
 Its such a shame 
 Anyway

 And I I I 
 I feel completely diconnected from the world Im living in 
 Whats gonna happen nextHere if its any consulation take mine 
 No no need for explanations its all right 
 With me it would only be redundant see 
 If you only try to keep it all inside 
 I lay me down with your decision 
 Blow your mind dont hesitate 
 This devil takes your pain away 
 Take mine 
 But now that I have finally found you 
 Im gonna take it one step at a time 
 Lets try to keep this good thing going 
 You tell a joke I nearly die 
 We have to laugh until we cry 
 Take mine please take mine 
 My margarita chum thats what you are 
 Im laughing my ass off when you sing 
 Everybodys happy now 
 The Lunaqueens become the lunatics 
 While Janis Joplin tells her friend 
 Hes just a onenightstand 
 Yeah 
 I hear you retching in my bathroom but I dont mind 
 No Ill clean it up tomorrow just sit down 
 Again you choke me when you grumble 
 You and me were so much like RG 
 And now Ill show you how to tango 
 I think its time for us to say 
 That this has been a perfect day and retire please retire 
 My margarita cum thats what you are 
 A vip is what you are to me 
 I love it when you take me on your lonely Sunday strollWhen your world comes crashing down 
 Dont waste no time 
 No this worlds big enough for you and me 
 And when you need someone to hold 
 Theres always someone around 
 Help help them to help you 
 Cause when youre down 
 Stand up again 
 Breathe in 
 And when youre down 
 Come up again breathe in 
 When you feel youre tumblin down 
 Youll be back upon your feet again 
 When you need someone to hold 
 Yeah when youre down 
 Hold on 
 Soon your eyes will see the sun I believe in love 
 Is it worth the tears you cry what about the love 
 You should leave the past behind do you believe in love 
 You are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in what you waiting for 
 Breathe in you are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in soon your eyes will see the sun again 
 And again and againIts funny how situations change 
 My imaginations playing games 
 I keep letting you back in my head 
 The glitter is gone spread your wings and fly 
 Ill try to keep it civilized 
 Baby all I wanted was you 
 Hold on hold on 
 Theres more to come 
 Hold on lost one 
 Cause theres some more 
 No ones ever hurt me more than you 
 I broken down in two pieces 
 And everything I sing is already been sung 
 Look at all these scars written on my skin 
 Some people find them hard to see 
 Now who will I be when 
 Im not with you anymore 
 You found yourself another place to hide 
 I cant believe that its all set and done 
 I pray to God for you your choice was right 
 The time has come for me to let us go 
 Cause theres some moreI lay my weapon down 
 Wont fight no more 
 Tryin to get you by my side 
 Though I have been in love before 
 But they could never take my clouds away 
 Babe if you were mine 
 I wont hesitate at all 
 You just let me know 
 Ill be the one to catch your fall 
 Anything you need 
 Dont keep me away 
 You make me so confused 
 The one I love loves someone else 
 Dont stop the music it feels good 
 It keeps my mind of me missing you 
 Keep the rain away 
 Theres nothing for me here 
 Without you by my side 
 Cause babe if you were mine 
 Baby whats it gonna be 
 Is it gonna be her or me 
 Tell me that I have to do 
 Cause I know that Im good for you 
 And Babe if you were mine 
 If you were mine 
 If you were mineIts good to see you after all this time 
 Its good to know that you are doing fine 
 But I cant help but notice in a bar on Friday night 
 There is something you should tell me 
 But your driver waits outside 
 Youre moving on youre going to a bigger world 
 Youre moving on youre ready for the universe 
 Its meaningless to me 
 Cause youre not here to see 
 The bigger side of me 
 I swear I saw a tear roll down your face 
 But theres a lot of smoke in bars these days 
 All I notice is the light that shines upon you from aside 
 Getting jealous of the coffee in the cup you hold so tight 
 Youre moving on to God knows where 
 Send me a postcard when youre there 
 Will I remember 
 What will it say 
 The weather is nice today 
 The bigger side of meIts easier not to be wise 
 And measure these things by your brains 
 I sank into Eden with you 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 Ill read to you here save your eyes 
 Youll need them your boat is at sea 
 Your anchor is up youve been swept away 
 And the greatest of teachers wont hesistate 
 To leave you there by yourself 
 Chained to faith 
 I alone love you 
 I alone tempt you 
 Fear is not the end of this 
 I alone love you 
 Its easier not to be great 
 And measure these things by your eyes 
 We long to be here by His resolve 
 To cradle the baby in space 
 And leave you there by yourself 
 I alone love you 
 OH now we took it back too far 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 All come running back to you 
 All these rhythms that you hide 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 I alone tempt you 
 Yeahahoohyeahah ooh 
 I alone love youIm sorry for the times that I made you scream 
 For the times that I killed your dreams 
 For the times that I made your whole world rumble 
 For the times that I made you cry 
 For the times that I told you lies 
 For the times that I watched and let you stumble 
 Its too bad but thats me 
 What goes around comes around youll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain 
 Cause it aint the first time that a man goes insane 
 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 Im suckin out his love cause I Ill never be nobodys wife 
 Im sorry for the times that I didnt come home 
 Left you lyin in that bed alone 
 Was flyin high in the sky when you needed my shoulder 
 Youre like a stone hangin round my neck see 
 Cut it loose before it breaks my back see 
 Ive gotta say what I feel before I grow older 
 Im sorry but I aint gonna change my ways 
 You know Ive tried but Im still the same 
 Ive got to do it my own way 
 Its too bad but hey thats me 
 Im suckin out his love I Ill never be nobodys wife 
 Im suckin out his love I Ill never be nobodys wifeThe words are slowly sinking in 
 Despair comes unexpected 
 Everything falls out of place 
 Now my imagination 
 It moves in all directions 
 I can only see your face 
 Now please dont leave me 
 Im caught in the middle 
 It pulls me down to places no one goes 
 So you need to find out 
 If theres a chance for us 
 What a difference it makes 
 Waking up here without you 
 Baby we can make this right 
 The waters so much colder 
 Hours lasting longer 
 Ever since you went away 
 Having a different point of view 
 That doesnt make it right for you 
 To decide that you dont have to stay 
 No please dont leave me 
 It pulls down me to places no one goes 
 This heart cannot erase you 
 After years replace you 
 Dont you think thats kind of sad 
 We can make this rightThinking of when we were younger 
 A long long time ago 
 On the roof where we made out oeeh 
 You told me secrets cause you knew that 
 Id keep it 
 Nowadays I feel so tired 
 I really dont understand 
 Of all the things you do and say oeh 
 Will you be just a reminder 
 Of what weve lost on our way 
 Can I say something 
 Baby I am wishing on the stars above 
 That your eyes will finally open up 
 Cause there was nothing 
 Enough to make another part of me believe 
 That you headed me blind not to see that 
 This was love this was love 
 When I hear you tryin call me 
 In the middle of the night 
 I wont answer cause Im scared oeh 
 That I rather had you with me 
 As I 
 I never thought of me without you 
 Of me living alone 
 You turned yellow in to grey oeh 
 Do you know how long I waited 
 For you to come my way 
 That you headed me blind 
 Ooh an I say something 
 And there was nothing 
 That you had me blind not to see that 
 This was love my loveOh some things are better left unsaid 
 Youll find a nice place to hide them 
 But days like this 
 There is just too much going on yeah 
 So Im picking up the pieces of my past 
 But I cant find no peace at all 
 So in other words 
 I am so ready to be found 
 So Ill try and I might 
 Stand up and fight 
 To leave this place someday 
 All I need is that moment 
 To make me believe that youre alive 
 And then Ill be alright alright 
 Paradise grown cold 
 One hand on my door 
 Way too high hopes 
 I cant tell right from wrong 
 Show me how its done 
 Lord I need to be saved 
 And then Ill be alright alright yeah 
 Oh yeah on days like these 
 There is just too much going on 
 So I try and I might 
 All I need is this moment 
 And then Ill be alright 
 And then Ill be alright yeahAll good things come to an end 
 Thats why I block my heart 
 And chain it to the wall 
 Cause you havent been there at all 
 In time my house became a place 
 Where the wrongs were right 
 And the rights were wrong 
 With too much drama and pain 
 But tell me are you proud of who I am 
 And can you please help me understand 
 Why you couldnt love me back 
 Forgiveness aint that hard to grasp 
 Daddy I need to hear you say 
 I I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby girl youve got to believe me 
 I never meant to break your heart 
 I I just wanted to love you 
 Somehow I didnt know how to 
 I still blame myself 
 Unable to receive the love 
 And affection from you 
 Like a daughter should 
 It did far more damage than good 
 Holding grudges are a waste 
 And life is way too short 
 And I just want to let go 
 Of all the things that I cant change 
 Baby girl youve got to believe me 
 I I never meant to break your heart 
 I just wanted to love you 
 But somehow I didnt know how to 
 If I had just one more day 
 No more promises well make 
 I would hold you tight 
 And tell you I love you anyway 
 You should have been there 
 You should have been there for me 
 You sure didnt care for me 
 Where were you babyIf roses are meant to be red 
 And violets to be blue 
 Why isnt my heart meant for you 
 My hands longing to touch you 
 But I can barely breathe 
 Starry eyes that make me melt 
 Right in front of me 
 Lost in this world 
 I even get lost in this song 
 And when the lights go down 
 That is where Ill be found 
 This musics irresistible 
 Your voice makes my skin crawl 
 Innocent and pure 
 I guess you heard it all before 
 Mister Inaccessible 
 Will this ever change 
 One thing that remains the same 
 Youre still a picture in a frame 
 I get lost in this world 
 I get lost in your eyes 
 Thats where Ill be found 
 Yeah yeah 
 Am I the only oneWho is the one that makes you happy 
 Who is the one that always makes you laugh 
 Who is the reason you were smiling 
 And dragged you through these times so rough 
 I was the one that made you happy 
 I was the one that eased the pain 
 But Im the reason that youre crying now 
 My own tears scattered by the rain 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can set me free 
 You can be who you wanna be 
 Deeper than deep you took me on a trip baby 
 You shared your wildest dreams and more 
 You dare me to express my feelings to you 
 I never felt that need before 
 But suddenly you needed freedom 
 You felt the need to break free 
 You started drowning in your sorrow 
 You didnt wanna know I had the key 
 You can sacrifice me sacrifice me 
 You can be who you wanna 
 You can be who you wanna beAha aha 
 Did you ever wake up in the morning 
 With a freighttrain running through your head 
 An empty whiskey bottle by your pillow 
 And a burned out unfinished cigarette 
 The night went up in smoke 
 Life is but a joke man 
 But I see nobody laughing nobody laughing 
 Did you ever live a day 
 Like the next day would never come 
 Bloods dripping on the floor but who cares 
 Who needs you anyway youre a stranger to yourself 
 And this aint no joke man 
 But I cant stop laughing yeah 
 Greedy angry people make me 
 Run around in circles backwards 
 Down the lonely road that keeps me 
 Run around in circles 
 How I want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead me 
 I just want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead the way 
 Just take me by the hand 
 How I want to yeah 
 I wanna try again yeah 
 Did you ever find yourself drowning 
 In a dark and crowded bar 
 The barman keeps on pouring and youre kissing everyone 
 The night will never end 
 Cause my horse is still saddled up 
 Thats why I am still laughing 
 Try how I want to 3x How I want to how enzYou you you make me live my 
 Happy heart 
 To my love 
 And now youre gone 
 Since I fell for you 
 Love brings my misery pain 
 Cause Ill never be the same 
 Since I fell for you yeah baby 
 Since your loveNo one can hear me cause no one is around 
 But I still hear your whisper in the dark 
 I know I can go I know I can leave when ever I please 
 But time is a jailer for me 
 A face in the window looking inside 
 But no one else sees it I know 
 And now that youve found that the years have changed 
 What the ending will be 
 Times just a jailer for me 
 I shut out the light 
 Alone in the dark 
 This time of night 
 Is the hardest part 
 I still hear the whisper your heels on the floor 
 I wait for the sound of your key in the door 
 But its only the sound of nothing at all and so it must be 
 That time is a jailer for me 
 Times just a jailer for meIm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs yeah 
 Became a rock and roll singer 
 Been trying to find my way going uptown 
 Hard work and determination 
 I never asked for anything 
 No higher education 
 Stood up tired of waiting 
 So many choices and illusions 
 Smack flow just to survive 
 All blues but no solutions 
 Struggle each day just to stay alive 
 It aint just image I create 
 Dont fill your judgement full with hate 
 It aint worth it 
 Im the true blonde proud wigger 
 Became a rock and soul singer 
 Tried to find my way going uptown 
 Bring on that revolution 
 My kids brown sugared skin 
 People jumping to conclusions 
 Letting me know I was made to sin 
 Im so done with moderation 
 You look around but you never look up 
 No intelligent conversation 
 Ill eat dirt but I wont shut up 
 I tried to find my way going uptown 
 True blonde proud wigger 
 True blonde proud wiggerThey say that sometimes 
 Youve got to pick up arms and fight 
 For what you believe is right 
 Some say Thats just not the way 
 You will only make things worse 
 So I close my eyes and turn my head away 
 And I hope itll be all right 
 Fall into a restless sleep 
 While so many innocent die 
 Thats why I sing yeah 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Maybe someday soon 
 When weve thought things over 
 Well know what to do but probably 
 Theres a much bigger chance you see 
 That it will all be gone gone 
 And just hope itll be all right 
 While so many others die 
 Yeah yeah 
 New York City London Jericho 
 Jerusalem Sydney 
 Anywhere you wanna go 
 Cape Town to the moon and back again well 
 Hail to all of us down here yeah 
 They say that sometimes 
 For what you believe is rightIm telling you it was a long way down 
 Heaven and hell 
 And all the people that I have loved 
 Disappeared somehow 
 Now I just did what I have been taught 
 Covering up my soul 
 For those who do not need me 
 I must go on 
 I lay it down 
 When you walked I walked right with you 
 You know I was always around 
 Tell me where did it all went wrong 
 Im running wild 
 Is it the things that I might have said 
 I only wish I knew 
 Now that the next waves come in slow 
 So I can still glide 
 Now take me to the one I love 
 With my head held high 
 Now lay it down 
 I guess I forgive you 
 I guess that I miss you 
 I cant help myself hey wait 
 No I dont wanna be alone the rest of my life 
 Now dont go cause its too hard for me to 
 Lay it downI got my head in the clouds 
 Running from the thunder 
 Proud as I can be I am 
 Waiting for the grey to replace the black in me 
 Daddy will the sun come up again 
 You and me we fail to see 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 Its plain to see you will agree 
 Its hard to stay together 
 Will we keep the thieves away 
 Will we both remember 
 To make the best of every chance 
 Or will we just surrender 
 Shouldnt we be making 
 Any effort needed to 
 Stop our dreams from fading 
 The sky is fading black to blue 
 We should be together 
 I am runnin out of faith 
 And it takes something more each time 
 Before I put my heart in your hands daddy 
 You and me did we fail to see 
 No one stays together 
 No it wont be easy 
 You will agree 
 To make this a forever 
 Fading fading fading fading oohIve got time to think about 
 The things you think about when 
 Youve got time to spare 
 Wonder why were here 
 And I wonder when or where it might go wrong 
 I wonder why I went along with you 
 Why I forgot to think 
 Forgot to think it through 
 I wonder why I 
 I wonder why 
 You go on you go on you go on pushing yourself 
 You keep you keep on you keep on fooling yourself 
 You dont know why you dont know 
 You dont know how you just dont know 
 You keep on I keep on fooling myself 
 Theres a time and place for everything 
 A time to act a time to dream 
 Theres time to wait 
 But no time to waste 
 You keep on I keep on fooling myself myself myself myself myselfTimes ticking and its crawling forward 
 Turns boys into men its awkward 
 The good life 
 Time to live and a time to die 
 A time to fall and a time to fight 
 Every word is just another lie 
 I wonder why I do even try 
 Im wishing that someone was near me now 
 Letting me know Im OK that Ill survive 
 Take me back ten years ago 
 When I thought 
 I lived the dream 
 My heart had been longing for 
 Tick tock so many changes 
 Going through all the stages 
 A time to hate and a time to love 
 Time makes me wait for God 
 Unknown future 
 Its scaring me 
 So now this is all that I can be 
 Instead of making a fast run 
 Trying to make this heart 
 Come undone 
 Cause time does not forget 
 What I was made for 
 So follow the stars 
 Without too many regrets 
 Times ticking and its crawling forward 
 Its a good life 
 Just a good lifeCrazy way to get your kicks 
 Shoot the silicone in your lips 
 If your figure makes you sad 
 Suck the fat right of your back 
 Make up your mind about your tits girls 
 You can puffm up so no bra will fit girls 
 Theres only one thing they cant fix 
 No I wont let you be misled 
 Thats the hole in your head 
 Can do nothing bout that 
 Hail hail modern world 
 Hail to all you boys and girls 
 Hail hail the colour green 
 Hail hail to what Ive seen 
 Hail hail hail this modern world 
 Tell her that shes beautiful 
 And put her on a Pedestal 
 But as you google triple X 
 Imagination kicks in 
 The more you think about sex boys 
 With someone else the better it gets boys 
 You have a purpose in your life 
 Besides cheating on the wife 
 For fuck sakes show some sense 
 These days adoption is a hot thing 
 You can get a child for nearly nothing 
 You take them home to a nanny 
 Buy off your guilt with toys and candy 
 But all the money that you work for girls 
 You cant compare it to love boys 
 And thats the hole in you head 
 Cant do nothing bout that 
 Hail hail the color green 
 Yeah Yeah YeahRelationship lost on a stormy sea 
 I hold on to you 
 Just hold on to me 
 When the lighting strikes 
 You hear the thunder roaring 
 And you dont know how long 
 This will go on 
 But I know I still love you 
 And I know you still care 
 So keep on tryin 
 When youre sure you still love me 
 I dont know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 Doesnt that mean anything 
 A sea of love 
 Dont let it drown us 
 Were way too far from shore 
 As we go deeper 
 As the wind grows stronger 
 It tries to tip us over 
 But we both learned how to swim 
 So lets just go on 
 Cause I know I still love you 
 Yeah I know I still love you 
 But I know how to love you yeah 
 And thats all I need to know 
 Yeah thats all I need to know babe 
 Oh thats all I need to know 
 Thats all I need to know 
 For nowI remember you stepped in the store 
 And you kept me standing in one place for way too long 
 There you smiled at me but all that I could say was just 
 Hello sir what will it be 
 Youre a Jesus with shoes on 
 I can see the light in your hair 
 Its happening again 
 Ooh baby 
 Well have you told your mom 
 That you wont be coming home 
 Dont you worry now 
 She can do it on her own 
 You shot me 
 In my heart 
 And I just wanna be 
 Your woman 
 Now were all alone 
 You make me lose my cool 
 I cant deny it and I cant pretend 
 What I see is what I get 
 Your arms around me 
 Here we stand 
 Now I believe that we can make it through 
 Take me as I am its up to you 
 Can you see the things that nobody else can see 
 Think it over now that you still can 
 Are you though enough to be my man 
 Or will you also try to walk away anyway 
 That you wont be coming back 
 Boy you look so fine baby how about upstairsYou grabbed my hand and twisted it so you had your way 
 No need to compromise cause youll find the right words to say 
 And Ill give it half a chance 
 Alone together all alone together all alone 
 Alone no more its Wednesday night 
 Someone is gonna treat me right 
 No not my man gets me this high 
 Its gonna be my neighbour at number 29 
 I think Ill pack my bags and Ill leave it all behind 
 Im gonna leave it all behind 
 No need to compromise cause these are the right words to say 
 Give it half a chance 
 You know I was talking to my neighbour at number 29 
 No not my man Its not my man who gets me high 
 You know its funny 
 Alone no moreSee that girl see her standing in the corner 
 On her own scarred inside shes a loner 
 Nobody can hear her crying at night 
 And see that all her smiles are tears 
 And she wears a mask to hide all her lies 
 To comfort all the fears 
 But when the suns starting to fade 
 Cause tonight all the men in the street will tell her 
 That she is beautiful 
 Yes she is beautiful 
 She is beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 Shes a lonely girl with cold hard eyes 
 Who doesnt know whats right 
 Beyond any doubt wants to break out 
 And live another life 
 Well Im not saying it would be very easy 
 But you have to understand 
 All she needs is someone to set her free 
 And take her heart with gentle hands 
 When the suns starting to fade 
 She is beautiful yeah yeah 
 Yeah she is beautiful 
 Yeah she is so beautifulI close my eyes 
 And imagine youre here 
 Did it all seem so hopeless 
 Given the chance 
 I would ask 
 Forgive me 
 I didnt do a thing to make you stay 
 I didnt say a word to make you stay 
 If I would have known 
 Could I have tried to make it easier 
 But I didnt do a thing 
 Or say a word 
 One word 
 And I dont know why youre gone now youre gone 
 No beautiful goodbye 
 You will never leave my mind 
 And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams 
 Now youre 
 Youre a star in heaven 
 My thoughts unsaid 
 Stuck in my head 
 And it all feels so useless 
 Never forget 
 To give all I have 
 I couldnt do a thing to make you stay 
 And I couldnt say a word to make you stay 
 If I could have known 
 But I couldnt do a thing 
 Yeah youre a star in heaven 
 Still I dont know why youre gone now youre gone 
 Youre a star in heaven now 
 Yeah youre my starTheres gonna be a yellow moon tonight 
 Dont leave the light on 
 Beads of sweat running down my face 
 You can catch them with your tongue 
 Colours run up and down your body 
 Every time you move 
 Every time every time 
 When I kiss the pictures on your skin 
 Make me shiver with the fire 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skin 
 A pair of eyes that stare across the room watching you breathing 
 Magic signs scratched inside a heart 
 Filled with your name 
 The reds the blues the greens and the greys 
 All bleed their colours through a sweaty haze 
 And we slide like a serpent on silky sheets and that twist and turn 
 Forever and ever and ever 
 Soft as a butterfly stings like a bee 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skinYou ask me what is on my mind 
 You notice theres a change 
 Theres something different 
 Different in the way I look at you today

 To help me out 
 And though my pain keeps on showing 
 They take the time 
 And realize I do love them now hear me out 
 Cause Im singing this song for you 
 And this is my way of letting you know and say 
 Thank you 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you 
 Nobodys ever going to erase you 
 Nobodys ever going 
 To all the men that I loved in my life 
 Thank you for letting me know I aint always right 
 Back in the days there was nothing I wouldnt do 
 I went through all of the fires to be with you 
 And though I was getting tired 
 Of the same old thing 
 You all took me places Ive never been 
 And I love you for that 
 Nobodys ever going to erase you yeah 
 When no one else is around 
 I stay with you 
 Whether youre up or youre down 
 Thats what Ill do 
 Nobodys ever going to erase youJust because 
 I may act like I know everything in life 
 It doesnt mean my hands dont shake 
 Got burning eyes 
 Inside I die 
 Look around the dawn of grace 
 Im living in the last days 
 I couldnt tell the rights from wrongs 
 Its all the same 
 I live for is dreams I fear 
 The truth is that I dont know nothing 
 And I dont know why 
 All the answers I dont have 
 Make me feel so worthless 
 God knows what lies ahead 
 So unreal 
 As I rely on lies instead of what I feel 
 Overwhelmed by modern days 
 Is there a right place in this life 
 I couldnt tell 
 In fact I dont know nothing 
 No I dont know why 
 God knows what lies aheadHell begins all in the mind 
 And so you pray for inner light 
 I know youre feeling left behind 
 But please dont say that nothings ever right 
 Cause every now and then somebody will just come along 
 To take you out of the light 
 Dont try to make them love you 
 Never cherish wrong thoughts 
 Dont criticize 
 That some of us aint got no joy 
 They aint got no love 
 Yeah they aint got no life 
 Heaven is what you create 
 Just think something good 
 And youll begin to rise 
 And dont look back at yesterday 
 Its understood 
 That if you seek youll find 
 Every now and then somebody will just come along 
 Dont criticize 
 Now I feel for them 
 Yeah I feel for them 
 I feel for them 
 I feel badly for them 
 Cause theyre missing out on life 
 Yeah theyre missing out on life 
 Thats no life thats no life 
 No lifeDont you ever try to leave me 
 I wouldnt know what to do 
 And I know this life aint easy 
 But we will make it through 
 Stop for a minute baby 
 I will go anywhere 
 Take all the time you need 
 As long as Im with you I dont care 
 Lets run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose track 
 Kiss me til my lips are numb 
 Squeeze my heart until it breaks til it breaks 
 Im not afraid of the burden song 
 No I will do whatever it takes 
 Stop the pity and the sorrow 
 Come here you will see 
 We can have fun tomorrow 
 In a place where its just you and me 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 And we will start something new 
 And leave everything behind 
 Cause I have never stopped loving you 
 If only we could turn back time 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose trackThe sounds of the world escape me 
 The moments you crack 
 Now youre driving 
 Down the highway of regrets 
 Youre a victim 
 Of your appetite 
 Promises broken 
 Youre that restless kind 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Stop this from pullin us under 
 Baby no one can do this but you 
 Blue dreams about you 
 My eyes wide open 
 You think you lost it 
 My heart for you 
 The sphere of youre not being here with me 
 You move in slow motion 
 Stopping rewind 
 Back to better times 
 Only you can stop this 
 But you Hey 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Only you only you can stop this yeah yeah 
 Only you only you can stop this yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Only you come on baby 
 Yo baby only you can stop this hahahaDay in day out keep it out of sight 
 The things we do without a thought 
 It never has to end 
 Draw the blinds entertain yourself 
 Cause theres no room for someone else 
 Just leave the world outside 
 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what its all about 
 Now baby wouldnt it be great 
 If we could turn it all around 
 Careless people will remind you 
 Were losing grip and need a shift 
 Theres no easy way out 
 Some will tell you that theres nothing wrong 
 Just get on with what you want 
 Day in day out keep it out of sight 
 One controls all that he sees 
 Would you like to see me crawling 
 One is what he wants to be 
 But he feels hes only fallin down 
 Ones in paradise 
 One searches his way back home 
 Well I say 
 One is cool 
 One is tired 
 One is smart 
 One is crying 
 One is dead 
 One is high 
 Did I wake up in time 
 We all are lost inside the maze 
 We cant find our way home 
 If we could turn it aroundThis aint my home anymore 
 My beating heart and restless mind in woe 
 My eyes have closed on my way back home 
 To a place that no one knows 
 I travel light no more starless nights 
 Makes me shine from head to toe 
 Ive got places to go in this life 
 Ive got places to go anytime 
 Whats yours aint mine anymore but somehow 
 The roads I travel feel like home right now 
 Aint my home anymore 
 Ive got places to go places to go 
 Aint my home anymoreIf I had nothing 
 Would you die for me 
 If I ever lose my mind 
 Would you fight for me 
 Cause lately you 
 Havent been around 
 I am still waiting babe 
 To be found 
 Do any of your ladies ever get tired 
 Tired of being strong 
 Still trying to make things right 
 When hes going to long 
 No I wont play that game no more 
 Cause you will never know how bad it hurts 
 When my love isnt shattered in pieces on the floor 
 I wont play that game no more 
 No more tears on my pillow case 
 Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made 
 You made 
 The nights so cold 
 And I am all alone 
 And I have been way to long 
 On my own 
 Probably you 
 Couldnt care less 
 If I would sufficate 
 From loneliness 
 Not knowing where you stand 
 But still you can help yourself 
 From nothing than me 
 No more tiers on my pillow case 
 Think about all your lies 
 As I walk away from you 
 Leaving me here to cry 
 Theres nothing left to do 
 So get out of my life 
 I wont make up my mind no 
 I had enough 
 No moreI will help myself if you dont have the time 
 It aint hard to find a new lover 
 Now its your loss baby better check your mind 
 What you got dont cover my needs 
 Cant help myself when I start to show a sign 
 I need love its like an addiction 
 Id hurt myself 
 If I dont get away 
 I got to get myself a greater sensation 
 I need more then you could give me 
 Dont you know that Im a lovedrunk 
 Careful now before Ill break your heart 
 I will charm you with my own style 
 Long enough to make you think Im yours 
 Dont make me wait cause that would be a crime 
 It is easier to find me another 
 Ill find someone and I will get what is mine 
 I keep looking for the better connection 
 Ill help myself if you dont have the time 
 Watch me boy Im out on a mission 
 You dont give me all that I need 
 So I continue with my little obsession 
 I need more than you could give me 
 Long enough to make you think youre mine 
 Listen baby theres something I gotta tell ya 
 Im a lovedrunk 
 Im on a mission baby 
 Im so intoxicated 
 Im so bad 
 Either way yeah Im gonna get it get itLost in time I cant count the words 
 I said when I thought they went unheard 
 All of those harsh thoughts so unkind 
 Cause I wanted u 
 And now I sit here Im all alone 
 So here sits a bloody mess tears fly home 
 A circle of angels deep in war 
 Weak as I am no tears for uX2 
 Deep as I am Im not ones fool 
 Weak as I am 
 So what am I now Im loves last hope 
 Im all of the soft words I once owned 
 If I opened my heart thered be no space for air 
 Deep as I am Im no ones fool 
 In this tainted soul  
 In this weak young heart  x 3 
 Am I too much for u  
 Weak as I amx4 am am 
 Weak as I am  
 Am I too much for you  x3 
 Weak as I amWalking through September rains unknowing 
 How you come around is that guilt still growing 
 As you slowly fade away 
 You were standing tall but thats the past 
 As many other things they do not last 
 Though I had to step away 
 Im wondering are you lonely 
 Ever since you walked away 
 Its so clear 
 Cause when youre in a shower all alone 
 Thats when you fall down 
 Not able to stand up again 
 At night as you turn down the sheets 
 Thats when you feel your mind 
 When its trying to go back in time 
 You dont even know how it all started 
 Still begging for my love now we have parted 
 At night as youre turning down the sheets 
 When its trying to go back in timeI know youve been lying boy 
 Every single word you say 
 Its the way your lips shake 
 When youre 
 Getting down and dirty baby 
 Dont you ask me how I know 
 And why its time for you to go 
 Cause you shouldve known better 
 Before you were 
 I know I aint supposed to cry 
 But I cant keep it inside 
 Cheater 
 Thinking you could get away 
 But you dont know who youre dealin with 
 All the love we had is gone 
 You gave it to the other ones 
 Youre neve gonna find a love like mine 
 The way Im 
 Now youre crying on my phone 
 You shouldve done that months ago 
 And now its time for me to get 
 No 
 You dont 
 I let you buy just a little time 
 So I could find a way to say goodbye 
 A little more time before I slam the door in your face 
 So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie awake 
 Cheater yeah 
 No you dont know who youre dealin with dirty boy 
 Goodbye baby 
 Bye bye bye bye 
 No you dont know who youre dealin with dirty boyAll you ever do is 
 Letting it all just pass you by 
 No need to try 
 All you ever say is 
 Baby its alright now 
 All you ever do is 
 Letting the hurt crawl up inside 
 No need to cry 
 Baby I feel just fine 
 What do you think of me 
 Dont you think I see 
 That youre just hiding from me 
 That youre just lying to me 
 Do you think Im blind sucker 
 Open up your eyes 
 Youve got to learn to cry 
 Baby thats alright baby 
 Open up your open up your eyes 
 Maybe youll feel just fine 
 All I ever do is 
 Waitin for you to tell me why 
 You never try 
 All I ever say 
 Could you tell me why 
 Hoping that you will tell me why 
 You never cry 
 All I ever say is 
 Baby its alright its alright for you to cry 
 Maybe youll feel just fineWell you know Ive got this problem  
 Cause there is you 
 No matter how I try to tell you you just cant see 
 Oh no I wont get through 
 Youve got a body and a brain 
 Instead of pointing to another 
 Take a look at yourself 
 Why dont you just use that thing inside you head 
 And try to tell me why 
 Youre free to speak could you explain 
 The reason for your narrow mind 
 Youre thinking medieval times 
 Your ignorance just gets you scared 
 Of everything and I dont know 
 Which way the wind is blowing 
 Hoping it will blow your fears away 
 Im sure Ill never solve this problem 
 But I hope you will 
 Ill speak my mind and tell you 
 Time and time again 
 Though I wont get through 
 Blow your fears away 
 Time and time and time and time again 
 But I cant get through baby 
 Let me explain 
 Hoping it will blow your fears awayI guess this time 
 Ive had more than enough 
 You allowed my mind 
 To think theres no true love 
 Baby youre out of line 
 Wasting all my time 
 Now find your own 
 To brighten up your life 
 I got a dark cold feeling 
 That Ive been here before 
 The obvious aint hard to see 
 She turned around and smiled 
 In her high heel shoes 
 Standing right in front of me 
 And I said leave him alone 
 Find one of your own 
 Took me a long time 
 To find a man like mine 
 The dreamer with a right run 
 Now he aint made for you 
 Like the way I am 
 Its not for you to understand 
 And find a man of your own 
 Dont you break up my heart 
 Yeah leave him alone 
 I hate it 
 Ill need a big black hole 
 For you to fall in 
 Baby you aint coming back 
 And if you try once more 
 You get two feet in the door 
 Ill be taking you to pitch black 
 You can have my own 
 Im out of control 
 So I am asking you nicely 
 For the last time 
 To leave him alone 
 Find a man of your own 
 Dont you break up my home 
 Girl leave mine alone 
 I guess this time 
 You will allow my mind 
 To brighten up your lifeBetween these walls I used to live 
 Without receiving 
 So much that I had to give 
 Between these walls 
 There were a lot of things that Ive could 
 Have done differently 
 But it aint about the way I live 
 Its the heart that counts 
 Comfort feed embrace love and protect me 
 Aint that what Im here for you said youd be here for me 
 No matter what 
 How come it feels so cold every time 
 You step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold when youre mine 
 In the spring of 75 thats when God made a mistake 
 He took me here 
 To the wrong side 
 I guess you did the best you could 
 But never good enough 
 Cause its the heart that counts 
 Aint that what Im here for 
 You said you would die for me remember 
 How come it feels so cold every time you step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold 
 Im freezing 
 Stuck here with this broken heart 
 All I can do is hoping for a full recovery 
 Why did you have me in the first place 
 Well Comfort feed embrace love and protect me yeah 
 Comfort feed embrace baby just respect me 
 How come it feels so cold every time 
 Comfort feed embrace love and respect me

 Thats what we do 
 We hardly sleep at all 
 Its getting late 
 Were just lying here with our mind full of thoughts 
 Awake dwelling on mistakes weve made 
 Its 5 in the morning 
 And what wed give to turn back time sometimes 
 To keep away that pain in life 
 And stop 
 And how we try to give you so much more 
 For youre my eyes pride my Fantastic Four 
 Only a mother 
 Only a mother would understand 
 Two of the strongest kids I will ever know

 My falling stars when Im far away 
 Youre the ones that teach me life 
 Im telling you baby 
 I love you 
 I love you only you 
 I was blessed by God 
 The moment He yeah 
 He sent you from above 
 So I could learn how to care and how to love 
 Youre the song inside my soul 
 Only a mother would understandTo this generation 
 We cannot forget 
 The ones that we have loved 
 The ones we left behind 
 Dont be afraid to reach out 
 This world is changing fast 
 For those who take a stand 
 Heaven knows 
 We grieve in our life 
 Dont let us pay the price grief in our life grief in our life 
 So much grief in our life 
 It will fade over time grief in our life grief in our life 
 Yeah to this generation

 Guilty for not willing to achieve 
 Come on happiness whats keeping you so long 
 How can we forget

 Dont let us pay the price 
 Oh yeahOh life is bigger 
 Its bigger than you 
 And you are not me 
 The lengths that I will go to 
 The distance in your eyes 
 Oh no Ive said too much 
 I set it up 
 Thats me in the corner 
 Thats me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 And I dont know if I can do it 
 I havent said enough 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you strive 
 Every whisper 
 And every waking hour Im 
 Choosing my confessions 
 Like a hurt lost and blinded fool fool 
 Well consider this 
 Consider this the end of the century 
 Consider this as well 
 It brought me to my knees failed 
 What if all these fantasies 
 Come flailing around 
 Now Ive said too much 
 But that was just a dream 
 That was just a dream 
 And that was just a dream 
 Just a dream just a dream 
 Dream dream dream dreamLast time youre breaking my heart 
 Its the last time 
 Last time Im falling apart 
 Took a while to even up the score now 
 Last time baby once more 
 Last time youre breaking my heart 
 Last time once again its the 
 Last time Im on my own again 
 How could I be so blind 
 How could you take me for granted all these years 
 You kept telling me no it wont happen again 
 But every time I turn around you stab me in the back 
 Your perfect smile aint flashing anymore 
 Youre magic is gone boy 
 This time Im breaking your heart 
 Its my turn now 
 Its my turn to let you fall apart 
 Im gonna make your eyes burn 
 And what I really have learned from this 
 Is that Im never gonna follow my heart again 
 And that therere people living in this world 
 Wholl treat you like a dog like they just dont care 
 And cause I dont deserve this 
 Im gonna watch my steps before I get me some ass 
 This is this is the last time 
 But every time I turn around you stab me in the backI have drunk virginia water 
 I have dug my own gravesend 
 Set my foot ashore in new port 
 Travelled far beyond my landsend 
 And home is in my head 
 I have dived into a blackpool 
 With a maidstone around my neck 
 I just drifted into the southsea 
 With no hull beyond my deck 
 Well I have lost a wheel in barrow 
 Try to cross the no one cambridge 
 When my liverpool grey shallow 
 Had to dig more wells in turnbridgeLately Ive been feeling down 
 I dont get around much anymore 
 So I just spend my time alone 
 Waiting for the phone to ring 
 I keep thinking of you 
 I miss the language that we speak 
 When we dont even talk 
 And every time I see you smile 
 You make it all worthwhile 
 I never loved someone like this before 
 Keep staring at your picture while I try to 
 Work my way around you 
 But nothings any good 
 Cause I keep thinking of you 
 You never told me I would feel 
 Lonely without you 
 Youre not supposed to make me cry 
 You said dont you worry Im yours 
 And in a while you were gonna call me 
 Well its been six hours now 
 I got to stop thinking of you 
 I gotta stopWell if you leave in dusty twilight baby thats OK 
 Cause there are women at the bar to greet you everyday 
 And you can take them back to lie with you and visit Jamies room 
 But they can never take the pain away or brighten all the gloom 
 And if your hands are cleansed with sorrow may it help you ease your pain 
 Though the windows have a view of city rain city rain 
 And if you walk in constant sorrow and you cry for me 
 May it hit the painful memories maybe then youll see 
 That if you drown yourself in liquor because it keeps you company 
 Then just remember who youre losing and be proud to set me free 
 Because it dont take back or disagree it just make you see so hazily 
 But in the morning light your life is scattered with the wind scattered with the wind 
 Well they tell you on the telephone to let him go 
 They tell you hes a sinking ship and hes trying to pull you down 
 Don t you know that every time you call me up 
 And say you want me back you know you break my heart 
 You said you want me to come back home and try again 
 You want me to make a brand new start 
 But if wisdom says to let him go then its hell because you just dont know 
 Until youve tried to love a man whos lovin whiskey lovin whiskey 
 My baby left me for the bottle and the lure of the nightlife 
 Good times and crazy women and another glass of Tangueray 
 Until youve tried to love a man whos lovin whiskey lovin whiskeyPeople will always talk behind your back no matter what 
 But Im telling you it says nothing about you 
 It says more about their lack of emotional intelligence 
 And I know that life isnt always fair but so what 
 You just need to get back up 
 And dust off your shoes and try again and maybe again 
 Yeah well if youre feeling uptight 
 Got nothing to relate to 
 Im telling you that in time things will just go away 
 And I will show you sunshine 
 And how to appreciate life 
 Yeah I will remember you to be strong every day 
 Leave it alone better hold on tight 
 And be who you are get back up and try 
 When they make you feel that you dont belong 
 No matter what stay strong 
 Gotta keep your head up high 
 Dont give in to peoples lies 
 No just shine yeah 
 Soon therell be a brighter day 
 Come and chase those clouds away 
 Just smile just smile pretty baby 
 When tiger hearts burn bright 
 Theyll make you fight a good fight 
 The sun will not always shine for you every day 
 Just lead the way dont be shy 
 And lift your head up way high 
 Even when think you lose your faith along the way 
 Dont give in to peoples lies 
 No just shine just shine 
 Yeah just smile 
 Im telling you to always smile my love 
 Dont let anyone else tell you what is right 
 Dont let anyone else no anyone tell you what is right 
 God will applaud you for it

 Watching the stars on the big screen 
 Then he lies awake and he wonders 
 Why cant that be me 
 Cause in his life he is filled 
 With all these good intentions 
 Hes left a lot of things 
 Hed rather not mention right now 
 But just before he says goodnight 
 He looks up with a little smile at me 
 And he says 
 If I could be like that 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day in those shoes 
 What would I do 
 Now in dreams we run 
 She spends her days up in the north park 
 Watching the people as they pass 
 And all she wants is just 
 A little piece of this dream 
 Is that too much to ask 
 With a safe home and a warm bed 
 On a quiet little street 
 All she wants is just that something to 
 Hold onto thats all she needs 
 Yeah 
 If I could be like that what would I do 
 What would I do 
 Im falling into this in dreams 
 We run away 
 Falling inIm watching your shadow cut by the moon 
 Peacefull I wait for the dawn 
 These moments in silence are all that I need 
 The softness of hearing you breathe 
 And I know it doesnt get better than this 
 Funny it starts with just one little kiss 
 Baby all I know youre no longer alone 
 Weve started a home of our own love 
 All my love is yours youre no longer alone 
 Weve started a home of our own love 
 Your ups and your downs powers and fears 
 Your presence fulfills my desire 
 Youre all that I wished for 
 Youre more than I need youre right where I want to be 
 I dont ask questions or try to explain 
 Telling myself it just happens this way 
 Baby all I know no youre no longer alone

 Or try to explain 
 Weve started a home of our own loveSir can you tell me how to get to Jerusalem 
 Cause I have kinda lost my way 
 Sir will you help me get there as fast as I can 
 Tomorrow might be too late 
 Cause things aint what they used to be 
 My love for life is gone you see 
 Am I fighting things I cannot see 
 People always tellin me how sweet and simple life could be 
 They say you might as well live before you die 
 But one thing I know for sure 
 I am a danger to myself how come 
 Yeah one thing I know for sure 
 I need some guidance to get me out of this hellhole 
 Jerusalem can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem yeah 
 It took me quite some time to get into Jerusalem 
 Cause I had kinda lost my way 
 I want to save me from myself so here I am 
 I hope its not too late 
 I am so afraid to love 
 Cause of the way Ive been hurt before 
 I think by now its time for me to leave 
 Jerusalem can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
 Jerusalem can you help me find what I have lost 
 Things aint what they used to be 
 I dont wanna die this way 
 Wishing that I could turn back time 
 Wasted time there is work to be done 
 Jerusalem can you help me find what I have lost yeah yeah 
 All rightI was dreaming last night 
 A figment of my brain 
 On the downtown train 
 And we had nowhere to go 
 So we got off to take a walk 
 In the pouring rain 
 You said you rode it once 
 And you would ride it again 
 Please take me with you 
 Tom waits for the morning train 
 To take us away 
 Me and mr Tom Waits 
 Cant wait no more 
 Im wrapped around your finger 
 Two fingers on my lips 
 No need to speak 
 Cause its all in our eyes 
 When they turned out the lights 
 They gave us one for the road 
 We headed for the tracks 
 And never looked back 
 This could never be real 
 Me and mister tom waitsBeneath the burning sky I hold you gently 
 When we watch the sun go down its heavenly 
 As you begin to cry I say I love you 
 That we will meet again someday 
 I know its true 
 As birds fly by the stars are lighting up tonight 
 Your hand in mine when we say our last goodbye 
 Fire in the sky 
 Makes me feel so full of peace to feel you with me 
 Cause we have nothing more to fear nothing to hope 
 I see you take your one last breath 
 I want you to know that you are free to leave my love 
 Now let it go 
 As birds fly by stars are lighting up tonight 
 Hey hey hey fire in the sky 
 Fire fire in the skyTomorrows here a new day rushing by 
 As I try hard to hold onto the light 
 When I feel fine the day is over 
 The saddest thing of it all I dont know why 
 I wanna stay where I am 
 But then I leave 
 I really try to get along 
 And as I walk I think about every little thing 
 That happens to me 
 Dont I know 
 That lifes a pack of lies 
 Feels like I am wasting time 
 It makes me cry 
 So you think youd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 Would you still like to 
 I love myself 
 Yeah Im a star I got it all 
 I am right even when I know Im wrong 
 Its another crazy day 
 And why wont I shut my mouth for a while 
 And pretend that I havent lost my mind 
 Its enough to make you cry 
 Im everything you wanna be 
 As I walk I think about every little thing 
 Dont I know that lifes a pack of lies 
 I set things up to tear them down 
 Scream until it blocks the sound 
 Its how I clear my mind eventually 
 Its my way or no way at all 
 Im not afraid to lose control 
 Am I someone you would like to be 
 Would you still like to try and walk a day in mine8 years just all went down the drain 
 Ill make sure I make it up to you 
 Try not to make the same mistakes again 
 I keep my word and make it work for you 
 So what Im trying to say is 
 Theres no way to win this life aint always fair 
 And once you learn how to play it 
 You still aint there 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but dont get burned 
 But help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be free 
 Dont worry bout how it all went wrong 
 Cause it wont change the past you see 
 And despite all the things I know 
 Theres no place that I would rather be 
 Just hold on 
 What it all comes down to we will be just fine 
 But every now and then youll find out theres no way 
 Out of this troubled state of mind I say 
 Sometimes you wont understand the way they play 
 But it wont break you 
 Im gonna make you believe 
 Im gonna make you see 
 You have to love 
 The things that life is giving you my child 
 Im gonna make you baby make you make you baby 
 And Ill be here to love you 
 There we go 
 But ones you learn how to play it 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but baby dont get burned 
 And help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be freeIve been loving you 
 Without even knowing 
 Ill never forget those days 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I havent seen you since 
 That day 
 Im sorry baby 
 Baby boy 
 When I saw 
 You the first time 
 I knew rightaway that 
 Were connected 
 In a way yeah 
 I believed 
 That there was a way 
 Something more 
 That I could ever express 
 In my own words 
 I Just knew 
 At the time I belonged 
 To you 
 But it all felt so wrong 
 To do the things that 
 My heart gave in baby 
 Im telling you 
 Ive been loving you 
 Without you even knowing 
 Ill never forget 
 Those days 
 Im sorry babe 
 With loafs on our minds a few goodbyes 
 We could never 
 Have givin it 
 A real try 
 But you were in my head always 
 And at this point in my life 
 I just know 
 That if you let me back in 
 I wont let go 
 Of you and me standing at last 
 I just know its a matter of time 
 Before it all falls back into place baby believe me 
 Those days 
 Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby 
 Ive got the light 
 And for you I will shine 
 Just be prepared 
 For a hell of a ride 
 Dont ever die 
 By the way 
 I feel for ever seems short 
 Im begging you 
 Ooooohaah 
 And I havent seen you since that dayWill you fly as fast and free as my love can 
 Tell me who you are just let me know 
 That one day youll be shining your light on me 
 And Ill wait patiently inside the dark 
 Come on love me Im telling you I wont be far 
 Some days when I wake before the sunrise 
 Dreaming wishing I could hold back time 
 That you might might never never have to live without me 
 And we can see our life in stardust written in the sky 
 I touch the sky every night I try to find the brightest star 
 Youre waiting there for me so close but still so far 
 One day I will get my wish so I can face the day 
 Guess Ive been waiting all my life for you 
 Youll be the one making my dreams come trueI am looking for answeres to questions never posed 
 I havent got a clue Im living like a ghost 
 I cant seem to read the signs 
 Im swimming in the sand Im searching 
 I hold on to your reasons Ill hold on to my dreams 
 Its all good and bad advice cause you have to choose 
 One friend says go ahead other one says dont 
 Im searching 
 Whatever I try I cant find it 
 Wherever I roam its all gone 
 No you cant find it first you gotta lose it 
 Looking for an angle to change my point of vieuw 
 Waiting for somebody someone to relate to 
 Hoping for forgiveness Im living for love 
 Yearning for a teacher to show me what to do 
 Im learning from failure thats all that I can do 
 Working in solutions a fiction of truth 
 Keep on searching 
 No you cant find it first you gotta lose itYouve got it easy 
 But youve got the nerve to make a face 
 Although Im strugglin 
 You cant tell because I keep it caged 
 We are together 
 But I feel youre pushing me aside 
 Lend me a hand sometime 
 The thought wont even cross your mind 
 You needed to take a good look at yourself 
 Cause Im about to close up shop 
 If you need a servant go find someone else 
 Its time to step up 
 Cause If I go 
 Ill be taking more with me than you 
 Would care to lose 
 Time is up step it up 
 Or youll see me walk away 
 Just so you know 
 Nothing you can do could make me 
 Turn around again 
 Your time is up step it up 
 If were together 
 Why youre pushing me away 
 Youre taking chances boy 
 Were getting closer to the day 
 You need to take a good look at yourself 
 I said its time to step it up 
 Yeah time to step up 
 Time to step it up 
 I said its time babe to step it up 
 Step it upFeels like I have a pillow pulled over my head 
 And nearly every night I wake up gasping for air 
 As you slowly die from grief so you could bury me alive 
 And now I see you suffocate in dreams and your lies 
 Breathe in gotta breathe out 
 No fear cause they wont come around 
 Breathe in breathe out 
 Ill be all right and lay my burdens down 
 God will you forgive them 
 For they failed the leap of faith 
 Take away the pain that blinds them 
 Teach them how to love instead of hate 
 Dont they see that loves for free 
 Yes Gods got a hold on me 
 Despite the crap you put me through 
 I can say I still got love for you 
 And dont fear no they wont come around 
 Breathe in and breathe out 
 Ill be all right Ill be all right 
 Breathe in breathe out 
 Breathe in and breathe out 
 I dreamed my faith could overcome my weakness 
 It wont defeat me 
 In my heart gotta have to be this careless 
 Just let me just let me let me 
 Let me breathe baby 
 I got to breathe baby 
 Let me breathe 
 Youve gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta let me breathe yeahI beg I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 Wont you just let go 
 Honey what you do to me 
 Why you messin with my man 
 Its not only Mister Right 
 He is also my best friend 
 Must be something I can do 
 To keep him away from you 
 Cause without him theres no chance 
 I could ever love again 
 Dont you understand girl 
 Save me 
 Please dont take away my man from me 
 Cause I just wouldnt know now what to do without him 
 We both know you care please dont take my man 
 What did you just do to me 
 Stabbing me right in the back like that 
 Well have you got no dignity 
 I could never do that to you 
 Let alone to you my friend 
 And now you got me thinking 
 Baby I should take the blame 
 For letting you be such good friends 
 But it never crossed my mind 
 This could happen over time 
 I gotta make you understand 
 We both know you care please dont take him no

 Dont you understand no no

 All that to make you stayLets say Im feeling better 
 Lets say Im feeling fine 
 Lets say I gave you all I had 
 And now Im out of time 
 And my best wasnt good enough 
 And now theres time to wonder 
 Now theres time to heal 
 Time to let it all come down 
 But I dont know what I feel 
 But it aches and it hurts and it burns 
 Oh it kills me 
 Tick tock you dont stop 
 You dont fade 
 You just stay 
 But Ill do it all again 
 Now dont you call me baby 
 Just dont pretend you care 
 Save your sorry for yourself 
 When Judas takes you there oh yeah 
 Once I really believed 
 There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely 
 But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart 
 Says youre not the only one 
 But it kills me 
 But Ill do it all againMourning through thoughts of you 
 My heavy heart 
 Cant find my way around 
 Its morning when it starts 
 You and I wanted love somewhere down the line 
 You and I All of the things that weve been through 
 Dont you know Deep down you know that I love you 
 That by know If you dont know that by now then 
 I might have to leave 
 Baby youre telling me that Im no good and I dont even care 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I can 
 Many times I am failing you cannot give what I want you 
 And if you ride my side my heart is made of stone 
 Then Im better of alone 
 Building up barricades day by day 
 Leaving me paralyzed selfish and afraid 
 I am not who I was I got broken deep inside 
 Make it feel I make you feel left out alone 
 All alone You need a place you can call home 
 Need a home What if Im finding out now 
 I cant do that anymore 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back the only way I can 
 Im trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay 
 But it doesnt work that way 
 But I am so afraid hey so afraid so afraid baby oeeh 
 Baby youre telling me that Im no good and I dont even care 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I canBaby why youre so sad 
 Whats the thing youre running from 
 Caught in the red lights 
 As if money is the cure 
 Is this your only way to survive 
 Are you trying to get even with the past 
 What happened to the dreams you had 
 I think its time for you to 
 Show them you are able 
 To leave without saying one word 
 I know it wont be easy baby 
 But I will run with you 
 Cause every night has a day 
 Every wish a prayer 
 Dont lose your faith 
 And Ill be holding your hand 
 Cause its never too late 
 Theres someone who needs you 
 So break down that wall baby 
 Theres a new world out there waiting 
 Just tear down that wall girl 
 Run away and dont look back 
 Break down that wall 
 Lady its your turn now 
 Just walk the streets with your head up high 
 Oh baby doesnt that feel right 
 So put a big smile on your face 
 You walk on straight 
 Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong 
 Isnt this your sweetest revenge 
 Feels good hey I told you so 
 Every wish has a prayer 
 Theres a new world out there 
 Tear down that wall girl 
 Run away run away run away 
 Cause I need youHeaded for the heartache 
 You took my love and broke it 
 Torn it and provoked it 
 As I trusted 
 Your charming little ways 
 And all those lies of praise 
 What have you done 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 How did you trick me 
 Into loving you 
 Youre like poison on my soul 
 Was it worth it 
 You pushed it way too far 
 Speading rumours about my heart 
 Hey it aint right 
 No it aint right 
 And I will blame it all on you 
 For I will never dance again 
 The way I did when you were my man 
 Dont be calling me 
 Youre messing with my head 
 Im so angry but instead 
 I still want more 
 Inspite of all the lies 
 The phony alibis youve given my heart 
 The way I did when you were my manIsolated from the outside 
 Clouds have taken all the light 
 I have no control it seems my 
 Thoughts wander all of the time 
 When I try to 
 Live life without you 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 No air no pride 
 If being myself is what I do wrong 
 Then I would rather not be right 
 Hopes turned into fear and with my 
 One wing I cant fly 
 With sunrise embrace my 
 Dreams tight and thats why 
 Birds 
 To a place without fear with no moonlight 
 To a place without moonlight and fear 
 All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight 
 All I need is trees some flowers and sunlight 
 Where memories are being made 
 And where the old one dies 
 Where love aint lost 
 Thats why birds dont flyI know the drill 
 Youve got your ball and chain 
 It holds you down the circle round 
 This story stays the same 
 It wont be long 
 And then your heart is frozen 
 The time has come to break away 
 Youve got it all 
 What makes you hesitate 
 Dont just wait for things to blow up 
 In your pretty face 
 Lift the weight 
 Try not to let it slip away 
 And you may find yourself again 
 I feel 
 People just dont know you like I do 
 Why youre making it so hard to see 
 When theres something wrong 
 It goes on and on 
 I know the drill 
 I found out the second round 
 That some things never change 
 Open my eyes 
 And let the days come over me 
 And maybe itll go away 
 On and on and on Youll see 
 Not everybodys here to 
 Break your heart 
 So there is a price to pay 
 To be someone youre not 
 I know the drill youve got your ball and chain 
 And maybe itll go awayGraduated fool that is what I am 
 For every time I failed you 
 Youre so beautiful I just turned and walked away 
 I jingle with words tangle my tongue 
 Stammering stutters 
 So I wrote you this song to finally tell you 
 What youve know all along I love you 
 Believe in me believe me 
 It was true devotion now these mixed emotions 
 Oh I did it again 
 I want you to forgive me when the pain has faded 
 Well be laughing again 
 Believe in me 
 Graduated fool Im better than I am 
 For that is what you made me 
 Please hold back your tears 
 I didnt deserve you anyway 
 Believe in me I still care for you believe me 
 Just believe in me believe me 
 When I kiss your face again all these mixed emotions 
 Of pleasure and pain 
 I want you to forgive me when the pain has faded yeah 
 Well be laughing again and again and again 
 Believe in me youre so beautiful believe me 
 Just believe in me believe meDo I really want to know myself 
 Do I want to see 
 Why Im wonderin every morning 
 Whos it gonna be today 
 Staring in the mirror 
 Come tell me whos that under my skin 
 And whats the reason were here for 
 Tell me what is my own true face 
 But hey here I come 
 Im the shows main attraction 
 Im a beautiful creature 
 Yeah thats what I am 
 But the other side of me 
 I cant explain why Ive become 
 Negative as can be oh yeah 
 Im wonderin where its coming from 
 I know I cant do without it 
 Sure makes me what I am 
 So I will never stop believin 
 In that I love myself someday 
 Hey thats what I am 
 Yeah oh yeahHavent we both heard enough babe 
 This is what were gonna do 
 Let me put my arms around you once more 
 Theres nothing left here to prove 
 Walk away just a little bit slower 
 Better hold on tight will we ever learn to let it go 
 Break through to the other side 
 I keep wondering 
 When were you ever gonna let me know 
 That you just wanted something else in life 
 What do you say when its all over 
 What do you know when nothings going right 
 The troubles in your mind 
 What do you do when you get lost inside your soul 
 Where do you go when loves gone 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 It was so hard when I watched you falling down 
 But it was time for you to walk alone 
 Just know if you really need a friend 
 And youre feeling like you cant go on 
 Just walk back just a little bit faster 
 Take my hand I will blow your fears away 
 For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else 
 And Ill be by your side 
 What do you do when its all gone 
 Where do we go when loves gone 
 When it all becomes reality 
 That this is where it ends for you and me 
 Im about to lose my mind 
 Will love find a way on time 
 Please dont try and kiss these tears away 
 We know weve both have made mistakes 
 If I could do it all again 
 I wouldnt change a single thing 
 What do you say nothing at allLook at you how far you came 
 Here from where it all started 
 You havent changed you stayed the same 
 So strong and bravehearted 
 And you would never ask for more 
 You make a difference in peoples lives 
 I have said it all before 
 So many other times 
 Im sure your daddy would be proud of you 
 If he could see the good things that you do 
 Youre just like twins so much alike 
 Im sure he would have loved you 
 Each and every day he would have made sure 
 That you would feel safe and be alright 
 In spite of pain and broken hearts 
 And all the weight on your shoulders 
 Youll survive just where you are 
 Even when it gets colder 
 Regardless of your longtime fears 
 You have the power to soothe your soul 
 The way you smile behind your tears 
 I wish he could see it all 
 Just like twins so much alike 
 Im sure he just would have loved you 
 And he would tell you 
 Always be proud of who you are 
 Dont let anyone put you down 
 Happy I always Im going to heaven 
 But just remember remember remember 
 Im sure my daddy would be proud of you 
 Just remember remember remember 
 If he would see the good things that you doRrrrrraaawwrr 
 This is the way 
 Well to get her 
 To get her together 
 Rrrrrraaawwrr 
 Pickin up the pieces 
 Break it down and bring it up 
 Pick it up and get her together 
 This is the way this is the way 
 This is how we get her together 
 Togetgetget to get her together 
 Togegegegegegegether 
 Pick it up and get her togetherIve got a bug in my head and a jumping heart 
 No time to spare 
 Turn left turn right step on it 
 Stopped by the traffic light 
 And all that honking screaming 
 The cabdriver is dreaming 
 Of the beach and babes 
 Leaning back easy as the sun goes down 
 But Im already late 
 Couldnt care less about it 
 If the sky was falling down 
 No I dont care you can stare 
 While the whole world is crumbling around me 
 Urban solitude breaking me down 
 Keeps me dreaming 
 Urban solitude shaking me down 
 So youve got a lot of stuff on your mind 
 Or a bleeding heart when nobody cares 
 Step in step out of the rain 
 Head for the flickering lights just head for the flickering lights 
 Theres always somebody dancing baby taking a chance 
 You can find a little romance someone will give you love 
 Although its just enough 
 To get you through the night 
 Well alright now 
 I dont care about it 
 Urban solitude shaking us down 
 Urban solitudeI might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well cheating on you 
 I always knew that you would be 
 Cheating on me finally 
 I never knew it be this soon 
 I didnt see it comin 
 Yesterday you let me down 
 The only friend I thought I found 
 Sleepless nights heart in two 
 Baby who was kissing you 
 If this would have happened to me 
 Ten years ago 
 Id make sure that youd be lying 
 Six feet underground 
 But little girls we grow up 
 Knowing love will find a way 
 So now we have an understanding 
 I cant see why I 
 Might as well 
 Be cheating on you 
 I might as well 
 Do all the things you do 
 Have a little fun 
 Baby you inspire 
 Its the way we carry on 
 Heavy steal is all you see 
 That is what is left to me 
 No remorse no dignity 
 Can we get any higher 
 To every other happy fool 
 Disloyalty will come for you 
 Lights go out on your own 
 So much for pretending 
 Now if this would have happened to me 
 Lets just rock and roll 
 Have you ever been in love before 
 And does it matter 
 Cause nothing ever seems to be 
 The way it should be 
 Tell me why 
 Dont you love me like the 
 Way you used to do 
 It might be worthwhile 
 To take a step back and ask 
 Yourself how this is gonna last 
 When its all a lie 
 Now here me out 
 I swear to God that this 
 Is something I will not forget 
 Ye yeah 
 Ye yeah 
 Oh ooh 
 I might as well be cheating on you I do 
 I might as well be cheating on you I doThe black side of my mind is getting weaker 
 The black side of my soul is getting white 
 This time Ill try and dig a little deeper 
 So I can change the wrongs into whats right 
 Dark were the days when our life was gone 
 Those were the days when fear of death came along 
 Let us get rid of this 
 Dark were the nights when I did not fight 
 Those were the nights when dark told me whats right 
 I did it all for love 
 Why havent I had enough 
 Leave it alone because in time 
 Walking away with nothing but 
 Pain in my heart for what weve lost 
 Try to stand tall with my head held high 
 The dark makes it hard for you to see 
 I gave it all for you and me 
 In time I will be ready to believe 
 Dark were the thoughts running through our minds 
 Those were the thoughts dragging me further down 
 What will you do for love 
 When is it ever enough 
 Leave it alone because in timeI dont exist for you 
 You made that crystal clear 
 Your sweetest thing for 7 years 
 What did I do to deserve this 
 Dont think you own my life 
 Ive still got my pride 
 Trying so hard to forget 
 I cannot help but hear your voice 
 This is love just trust me baby 
 Other girls mean nothing to me 
 Why dont you keep your big mouth shut 
 And all the bridges that you burn 
 Come back one day to haunt you 
 Its just a matter of time 
 Baby dont get me wrong 
 If Im not there to catch your fall 
 Did I try for too long 
 Am I to blame for you being you 
 Save those tears for someone else 
 Your troubles only just begun 
 Hands off my sunshine leave it alone 
 Before I go commit a crime 
 Im gonna show you what you taught me 
 No respect no mercy 
 Till you fall down on your knees for me 
 All the bridges that you burn 
 Am I to blame for you being youI dont want no trouble baby 
 I just wanted you to see 
 That I can get you much better love 
 Ill be that bitch shell never be 
 I aint no homewrecker but you deserve that killer bee honey 
 Ill give it up for anything but easy 
 Let me reply its got to be me 
 You cant imagine what I am going through 
 And all those ladies stop and stare at you 
 Now come on and get it 
 Now lets get higher 
 Because Im the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Walk down here baby 
 Leave it all up to me 
 While I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it youll be begging me on your knees 
 Cause I got the fire yeah 
 When it comes to making love 
 Yeah Im the one youre looking for 
 But dont you waste all of your time 
 Come over here before Ill change my mind 
 Ill take you higher 
 Yeah I am the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire 
 Cause I will make you cry for more 
 Before you know it that youll be begging me on your knees 
 Ooh yeah 
 I will make you cry for more 
 Higher higher higher 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Come on and get it 
 Because I got the fire and youd put it on me 
 Im taking you higher 
 Im readyNo hurry Ill be waiting for you My baby 
 Now dont you worry 
 Ill be fine 
 Just take your time 
 To make up your mind 
 Draw a line 
 Or flip a dime 
 Waiting for you 
 Its easy 
 If you want to please me 
 Dont tell me maybe 
 Come back home complete me 
 No strings attached 
 Thats a promise I cant keep 
 So I waste my time 
 With lazy crazy dreaming 
 A sparkling wine 
 A twist of lime 
 A whisky soda hole in time 
 When youre not here 
 Dont say youre sorry 
 Dont say it 
 No 
 Dont say youre sorryCold blackhearted golddiggers 
 I guess that too much generosity 
 Is making people take you for a fool 
 And at every opportunity 
 Theyll even try to get some more from you 
 So theyll cheat and lie 
 But I will let God deal with the things they do 
 Cause when they get their hands on all that gold and paper 
 They forget to say thank you 
 But will money bring the things they want 
 And does it solve the problems that they face 
 Cause when everything is said and done 
 They will find out its another day 
 Full of emptiness and lies 
 And they can grab as much as they can 
 But it will never buy them one seat in heaven 
 Oh when money rules them 
 Let me tell you 
 Moneys never bought me anything 
 I said nothing no nothing at all 
 I said nothing baby 
 Nothing nothing nothing at allThe things you say 
 In your innocent way 
 Remind me how it should be 
 Your love I can trace 
 In a wide open space 
 Oh your beautiful face I have seen 
 Its the way you walk 
 And the way that you talk to me 
 Youre Gods gift to my world 
 The prettiest girl 
 And it feels like I live a dream 
 The silence I fear 
 Preach to the morning sun 
 So just hold me now 
 Ill stay here all night cause I 
 Dont feel so alone when you are 
 Holding me tight love 
 The things you do and say 
 Always go hand in hand 
 Youre all you seem to be 
 Not a shred of you pretends 
 I will run like a fool 
 Just to be by your side 
 Dont hold back my love 
 Youre my joy in this sad sad world 
 You are safe with me 
 Dream and you will be free 
 Ill stay here all night cause II 
 Holding me tight love 
 Just hold me now 
 And if I could have it my way 
 Id tell you to stay here always 
 I will be waiting for you 
 Ill be waiting and theres nothing else I can do 
 Youve taken me over 
 Holding me tight loveWhatever you say babe 
 Dont you know 
 Im not afraid because 
 I know just where to go 
 Im loving you babe 
 All the time 
 I know that love will find a place for 
 You and I 
 I know I should have called you first 
 But I couldnt stop myself from driving to 
 You just to see 
 You smiling makes me wanna be with you 
 Is that all right 
 Boy I just cant help myself 
 And thats the reason why 
 Whatever you say babe 
 Well 
 Im driving in my car the music plays 
 The way you make me feel its like 
 Im walking on air 
 Ill make you believe again that lovers do stay 
 And every now and then we fight 
 Without walking away 
 Baby you just drive me crazy 
 Forget the world 
 For a while 
 Doesnt matter 
 Gotta have you 
 In my arms 
 That is were Ill stay 
 Baby baby baby baby babyI love you baby 
 Who will I have to be 
 For you to be the one 
 So we can start a fire 
 Until the day comes 
 Ill be waiting here 
 If it takes forever 
 I will look to see 
 What lies ahead of me 
 Oh baby when I hear your voice 
 Youre leaving me breathless 
 Youre giving me no other choice 
 So baby Ill just let you know 
 Im keepin my heart for later 
 Keepin my soul alive 
 And I will wait a lifetime 
 Until its you and I 
 Anywhere you wander 
 Anywhere you go 
 I promise I will stay 
 Boy I love you so 
 There will be a time 
 When all the waitings done 
 And doubts will disappear 
 They will be one by one 
 Its leaving me breathless 
 So baby I just let you know 
 Keepin my heart for later 
 Do you feel me baby 
 Im keepin my soul alive 
 Until its you and II spy I spy a tear in your eye 
 So Ill try Ill try to get you out of here 
 You sigh just move a little closer 
 Time flies soon the night is over 
 Morning noon night all day 
 All I ever wanted was for you to come my way 
 Weve got time so let it slide 
 Roll me over get on top

 And make an end to my lonely

 I want you to tell me Im still in your heart 
 More than the day before 
 Theres gotta be something that I can do 
 Thatll make you love me more 
 Better not wipe us out today 
 Once upon a dream the memories meant nothing 
 And now theyre all that I have left today 
 We started up as friends thinking this would never end 
 But you had to throw it all away 
 All away 
 Come on 
 Dont wipe us out wipe us out baby 
 Youd better not wipe us out tod 
 Gotta be something baby 
 Gotta gotta be something I can do now 
 Hey now baby 
 Dont you do that to usA taste of breath a kiss sweater than honey 
 Your eyes in a misty dream a million miles away 
 And in my ear you whisper my name 
 Just like in some old news flash 
 From light years ago 
 Van Dykes on the slide trombone 
 Through the smoke of the party room 
 Your teeth like the ivory coast 
 Start singin my favourite song 
 And it happen to be mood indigo 
 Mood indigo 
 I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 Could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Take off my make up 
 Holding on to my heart 
 Smokin them downhill 
 In a room number thirteen 
 Tryin to stretch my luck again 
 Down the corridor your footsteps echo against the wall 
 My man of mystery my date with infinity 
 Tonight Im gonna sacrifice for the first time in my life 
 Make it all come back to me like an old forgotten dream 
 Mood indigo I just go weak when I hear mood indigo 
 It could last for weeks until I decide to wake up 
 Completely lost in my mood indigoGirl girl girl 
 When I hear him talk 
 Ooh my mind gets blocked girl 
 Speak up cause my jaw is locked 
 Which is good good for me girl 
 It hides like a warning sign 
 But Im too blind to see 
 Speak up yes Im coming down 
 With an ice cold fever 
 Ice cold fever 
 Still got my hands theyre clinging 
 So I just keep going 
 I dont know where I belong 
 Could I belong to you 
 No I dont know where I belong 
 Could I belong 
 Girl girl girl 
 Get it while its hot they say 
 You see Im burning up here 
 I want to but I just cant stop 
 And it hurts 
 It hurts like hell girl 
 You turn me inside out and upside down 
 Ooh you got me head over heels 
 Im stuck yes Im coming down 
 Ice cold fever aha 
 Oh girl yeah I belong 
 To you you you 
 To you yeah you 
 Yeah I belong to you 
 Say you yeah you 
 Alright 
 Hey 
 HeyYeah 
 Now I believe 
 That what I used to think 
 Was a lie 
 Is really a life 
 Now I can see 
 Theres only one place to reach 
 Only one thing to preach 
 And thats the highest 
 Its the strangest thing 
 That I can feel so much 
 There is no reason 
 There is no logic to feelings 
 Cause when love is the dealer Im addicted 
 So fascinating 
 I cant stop this constant craving 
 Youre contagious 
 That I can feel 
 So much for someone somehow 
 Its the strangest thing that 
 I can feel 
 And I cannot hide 
 Even if I try 
 You mean everything to me 
 Any fool can see 
 What youve done to me 
 And when youre not here 
 I just cry hey hey 
 I could die 
 Yet the best is still to come dear 
 Yet the best is still to come 
 For us 
 Oh the best is still to come 
 And I cannot hide even if I try 
 Any fool can see what youve done to me 
 I just cry 
 And when yourre not here 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeahIm gonna get out of my shell 
 Try without anybodys help 
 To lose this heavy load 
 And get my life back on the road 
 Ive seen the worst when I was down 
 Only loneliness I found 
 Now Im climbing to the top 
 And I aint never gonna stop 
 Ill carry on though the road is long 
 Im gonna get myself together 
 And Ill hold on cause I am strong 
 Gonna try to make it better baby 
 The rest of my life Ill take these chances 
 Time goes by so very fast 
 Ill share my fortune and my failure 
 Till theres nothing left 
 And if somewhere down the line 
 Ill find Im running out of time 
 I hope to god that I can say 
 I made the best of every day 
 Till then Ill carry on though the road is long 
 Im gonna try to make it better baby 
 Till theres nothing leftIts a shame the rules change not the game 
 Such a shame Its the same 
 Now everything is in vain 
 All in vain its such a shame 
 Could it be true that theres nothing left to do 
 For me and you cant be true 
 We all cant be such fools 
 Could life be so cruel 
 Maybe I dont even try fearing what Id find 
 Guess I am a number on the line 
 Could you please tell me why 
 Were on the same line and were fallin behind 
 On life 
 Life is great Im walking in the sun and everything is cool 
 Yeah its true theres so much we can do 
 It feels so right 
 Yeah its all right 
 Baby I dont even wanna try fearing what Id find 
 Could you please tell me why were on the same line and 
 Fallin behind 
 Fallin behind on lifeIts funny how I blind myself 
 So I dont have to see 
 Theyre taking me down and bringing me to my knees 
 Letting me know Im alone 
 Not afraid to die no more 
 The house above 
 Heaven wont you pick me up now 
 Love all I needed was love 
 Someone give me some love 
 I guess its only meant for some of us 
 Life has made me lose my mind 
 Im not doing all right these days 
 Lying naked on my kitchen floor 
 So cold well I thought I had a lions heart 
 I guess I was wrong 
 I feel so damn lonely 
 Love all I needed was some love 
 Could someone give me some sweet loving 
 Cause this is more than I can bear 
 My nights are getting darker as time goes by 
 How Ive tried to keep these walls from falling down 
 One way or another they shut me downWere breaking things we cant repair 
 None of us will take the blame 
 No nothing can be done this time 
 All the memories that weve made 
 I threw them all away 
 Theres no need to talk it over 
 Dont let me get you down 
 Lets just move on 
 I am setting you free 
 Cause I dont wanna hurt no more 
 I dont wanna make you go 
 Through one more rainy day 
 No I dont wanna hurt no more 
 Strange enough I always knew 
 Im taking off today 
 Dont wanna hurt no more 
 The darkness you left in my soul 
 Do we know how much weve lost 
 Will the moon be shining as bright as before 
 And as Im singing this song 
 The tears well up in my eyes I will always wonder 
 Why I will never have the life I wanted 
 Now Im letting it go 
 No I dont wanna make you go 
 Theres not much more to say 
 Its too late now 
 I wont hurt no more 
 So I wait till morning comes 
 Youve made it clear that is has been 
 Only pain lovin me 
 Things that we wont do for love 
 I am letting you goSittin on the beach the island king of love 
 Deep in fijian seas deep in some blissful dream 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps in the lap of her lover 
 Subdued in all her rage 
 And Im aglow with the taste of the demons driven out 
 And happily replaced with the presence of real love 
 The only one who saves 
 I wanna dance with you 
 I see a world where people live and die with grace 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 The stillness in your eyes convinces me that i 
 I dont know a thing 
 And Ive been around the world and Ive tasted all the winds 
 A half a billion times 
 Came sickened to your shores you show me what this life is for 
 The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace 
 I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds 
 In this altered state in this altered state 
 Full of so much pain and rage 
 You know we got to find a way 
 To let it go 
 To let it go to let it go to let it go 
 Sittin on the beach the island king of love 
 Deep in fijian seas deep in the heart of it all 
 Where the goddess finally sleeps after eons of war 
 And lifetimes shes smilin 
 And free nothin left 
 But a cracking voice and a song oh lord 
 And lead us back to a world we would not face 
 We would not face we would not face 
 We would not face we would not faceIm just thinkin about the child in me 
 That I sometimes feel inside 
 And Im figuring out just what it is 
 That makes me feel so small 
 Is it you that hurts me when I give myself 
 Every day and every night 
 Am I too blind to see that it doesnt work out 
 Did I really ask too much of you baby 
 Do you mean to tell me thats the way it is 
 Do you mean to say 
 Its all so hard Its so hard 
 As I search for an answer I see the clear blue sky 
 And I know that youre the one to blame 
 And I feel so nave 
 When you say that our love to you was just a game 
 I dream my dream Im sane Im insane 
 Oh please dont please dont speak to me that way 
 Damned its so hard why youre so hard 
 Why youre so hard Its tearing me apartDont kill that man dont kill that man 
 He could be the one that brings you gifts for Christmas 
 Dont kill that man dont kill that man 
 He could be the one for free without the dullness 
 This could be great 
 Dont just let go 
 He might be the one to know 
 The way you should be loved 
 A few words are enough 
 To lighten up your days when shadows fade away 
 But Im not sure hes safe 
 No Im not sure yet 
 He could be the one to trust when youve been lied to 
 Dont kill him yet dont kill him yet 
 He could be the one you can turn your blind eye to 
 This is pure gut 
 He could be that man who knows 
 He could be the oneMake it rain 
 Right behind that perfect face 
 Theres someone who keeps 
 Secrets hidden well 
 Think I dont want to know 
 Reasons why youre crashing over me 
 I dont look back 
 Darling so it goes 
 But I regret 
 We couldnt 
 Make it rain 
 And all our dreams were left to dry 
 Cant Make it rain 
 Theres not one cloud left in the sky 
 You say you tried 
 We bled weve cried 
 We couldnt make it rain 
 We had everything to live for 
 Even if we didnt understand 
 The game of give and take 
 Was more than just the sum 
 Of what we make 
 The most of time 
 So well move on 
 And leave it all behind 
 Cause we couldnt 
 Now I cant help thinking about 
 Places we would go 
 But I wont be around no more 
 But this fault wont be mine 
 Everything is gone 
 Cant make it rain 
 Theres not one cloud left in the sky so 
 All our dreams were left to dry 
 We bled we cried 
 You said you tried 
 We bled weve criedRule number one there will be no rules 
 Rule number two thats for you 
 Rule number three when in doubt theres the door 
 Rule number four tell me more 
 No lies no tricks of any kind 
 Be true love hard show inside 
 And I will absolutely love you 
 Rule number five make sure Gods on your side 
 Rule number six it will never be fixed in the mix 
 Rule number seven leave no space in between 
 And heres number eight just be real not make believe 
 When shadows appear show me the power to shine 
 Travel the world all around 
 Laying the troubles downIts not what I needed or what I wanted but then again 
 Living a lie I couldnt go on another day 
 There must have been a way to busy adoring you 
 Its over oh oh 
 I hear hello holding on my phone and I cant recall 
 That I ever felt this sad in my whole life before 
 My blood runs cold and honestly 
 I feel lonely baby so lonely baby 
 These days are just way to bright 
 I need a reason to believe 
 Cause I keep telling myself 
 That we are still in love 
 Even though you took off and broke my heart 
 And letting me know that I aint the one youre looking for 
 Oeh why do I keep telling myself 
 And letting me know that I aint the one you need no 
 Were talking all night to a filthy sky and some rain 
 Im tryin to find just little bits of yesterday 
 I guess you never knew how much I needed you ooh 
 Its over 
 And handle it covering my eye so I can see 
 Somethings angels always what they seem to be 
 Things in my mind keep flashing by 
 Whats going on what the hell is going on 
 I need a reason to believe yeah 
 Ooh why do I keep telling myself 
 Ooh hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Ooh no 
 Were living a lie baby oh 
 Were living a lie baby 
 Were living a lie now 
 Lie now heey hehehehe 
 Hehehehe 
 Were living a lie 
 Were living a lie hey 
 Were living a lie babyYou come around telling me you dont need me no more 
 You say it is all about to end 
 If you got nothing more to say then shut your pie hole 
 Just walk away and leave me lonely 
 Cause theres no time to waste 
 For me to have a taste 
 Of all the other pretty men whore waiting out there 
 For me to give them all my lovin 
 Now theres no doubt about it this girl still got it 
 Yeah Im on fire give me something 
 Now theres no time to waste 
 For me to have it all 
 Know where we gotta go 
 Down where the water falls 
 Now walk on to the bay 
 Where I take off all my clothes 
 Hey baby what do you say 
 Well have you ever met a girl this sexy like me before 
 So when I woke up there were 3 of us this morning 
 You sure know how to treat me well 
 Dont want no flowers dont need love and understanding 
 This time its all about myself 
 Cause all this time around 
 Yeah Ive been missing out 
 On a lot of love and affection 
 Ill hand you all directions 
 On how to walk on to the bay 
 Have you ever met a girl this hot like me before 
 Just walk on the bay 
 Where we take off all our clothes 
 Ooh baby let me hear you say 
 I have never ever met a girl this juicy like you beforeI look at the ground its filled with lies 
 When you got lost I got so lonely 
 Give it time dont move on 
 Let it dry times passing by so slowly 
 Border lie face Ill keep it straight 
 Cause no one knows I only have dark days 
 New love no use 
 Pain in my face pretending as always 
 And these are the bright days 
 In my dreams Ill make you want me 
 One more time the sun will shine 
 Cause they wont love you like I loved you 
 You still make me cry 
 Grief makes numb every day 
 How does it come I get lost on the speedway 
 No joy or delight 
 Just prove me to bed so I can shut my eyes tight 
 Did you love him like you know you should 
 I was in it for the long run 
 Will you ever feel the same again 
 Theres no turning back cause my heart is long gone 
 Theres no turning back 
 No they wont love you like Ive loved you 
 You still make me crySurely I am willing but I wont 
 Claiming that Ill do it but I dont 
 Knowing Ill do anything you want 
 Pretending I am someone that Im not 
 Good God my mind 
 Wont let me think right 
 I know youre trouble 
 But Im determined to create 
 These things up in my head 
 That never happen 
 In time Ive gotta choose 
 Freedom or loyalty 
 Look at what you have done 
 What am I gonna do 
 So now that you have made a mess of me 
 And showed me stars that 
 I have never seen 
 I know its wrong why does it feel so right 
 You havent got me yet 
 But you might 
 Youre smiling back at me 
 I wanna do it 
 I wanna be with you 
 Let me get through it 
 Am I gonna make it back alive 
 When you show me all the things that you can do 
 That never happened 
 What am I gonna doAnother day is here another drama will appear 
 And I think its time that I gave my mind a break 
 Im feeling used and abused and misunderstood 
 I gotta find me a place 
 Where theres no one else around 
 Every time I see you walking away 
 My heads spinning around 
 No I never feel the same 
 I didnt know what I had baby till it was gone 
 No nothing even matters even matters at all to me 
 No more 
 I aint done much lately 
 Sleeping and staring at the wall 
 Watchin TV 
 And even though Im down still 
 I have faith in my moon 
 Well I said hey get rid of it 
 Photographs of you here in my room 
 Reminding my heart and soul that I still love you 
 Whenever Im with you its wearing me out 
 No matter what you do youre the one I love 
 Now baby where did we go 
 Did we give it a chance 
 Cause everything is about to go down tonight 
 And as I said before 
 And while youre out there in search of you 
 And try to keep it all together 
 Where were you when I needed you 
 Well I said hey get rid of itCan you tell me how you feel 
 When you turn on your tv 
 When you see me singing through my tears 
 Ive saved up all these years 
 Can you tell me what you see 
 When you read the magazines 
 Do you see yourself in me 
 When the DJ plays this song 
 Can you tell me what you hear 
 And I hope you feel the way we felt 
 When you put us all through hell 
 Can you tell me how you feel now 
 How do you feel how do you feel 
 Tell me how you sleep at night 
 Do you take those pills like me 
 Or do you toss and turn 
 And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep 
 Cause you just dont care 
 How do you feel 
 And now Im in your face 
 And you feel that empty space 
 Why did we how did we come to fall from grace 
 Falling falling 
 Didnt you just hear us calling out 
 No theres nothing left to say 
 Cause you shouldnt have stayed away 
 No man leaves his flesh and blood this way 
 How do feel how do you feel 
 Cause you just dont care 
 It took a crowd for me to see 
 That it really wasnt me 
 The swaying crowd is the cleansing rain 
 It took the pain away 
 And I hope youll find yourself alone 
 In a million dollar home 
 You will be stuck 
 With a heart like a rock 
 I hope you run out of luck fool 
 How do you feel now 
 Does it hurt does it hurt 
 Does it hurt baby 
 Im just wonderin how it feels 
 Just wonderin 
 Does it hurtSure got my piece of heaven 
 An angel in disguise 
 Gone wild 
 But I thought you were a man 
 Who knew right from wrong 
 Thats why I really dont understand 
 Why hes with her 
 Its killing me 
 What has she got that I dont have 
 Is it the way she looks at you 
 Laughs with you can she 
 Does she make you beg for more 
 This is hurting 
 I tried to call him 
 Anytime anywhere 
 But hes never there 
 So I went to his place 
 And waited all day 
 So he would explain it to me 
 And this is what he said 
 There is nothing left to say 
 I had my fill I went away 
 Your crying eyes wont change a thing 
 It was just a fling 
 Well how could an angel break my heart 
 He said We could still be friends 
 Are you kidding me 
 Talks to you can she 
 But twice every year 
 When hes in tears 
 When he loses his mind 
 And cant help but cry 
 Hell call me and then 
 I am better than I am xSo many times Ive cried 
 When dark clouds block the sunlight 
 And its raining in my heart 
 Ill keep my head up high 
 So little time to try 
 To find out about the feeling 
 Thats deep inside of you 
 And keeps the dream alive 
 So remember 
 When youre down and out 
 In the sand 
 So many minds are torn 
 By overloading senses 
 Youre breathing in and out 
 No second left to sigh 
 Nobody will tell me 
 What theyre feeling deep inside 
 Were all just telling lies 
 Every time you wonder 
 Why the feeling lingers 
 And its stuck inside your soul 
 Youre crying when you smile 
 When youre stuck in the middle 
 When you cant solve the riddle 
 Lay it down in the sand 
 When you cant help but shiver 
 Get you finger off the trigger 
 Get it out your head 
 Out of your hands 
 When everythings missing 
 And theres nobody listening 
 Lay it down 
 In the sandWhat about those songs you sang my love 
 Were they meant for her 
 And all those words you never said before 
 What about those kisses in my sleep 
 Tomorrow will be fine 
 Yeah just a little while 
 Oh no this aint no way to live 
 Cause I will be 
 Watching every step scared I wont find you again 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away 
 Ill be watching every step scared I wont find you again 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself yeah 
 What about that bracelet in your car 
 Was it meant for her 
 I am more than you deserve 
 Why couldnt you just lie suicide 
 Why couldnt you just lie 
 Cause if I leave you by yourself 
 Dont you waste my time suicide suicide 
 Dont you waste my time suicide yeah 
 I am more than you deserveHey Michel hows life are you ok 
 I wonder if you ever think of me 
 Its been 9 years since that kiss 
 I can help but reminisce 
 Hey Michel do you remember 
 We walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand you and me 
 Smiling faces so in love 
 Hoping that they all could see 
 That we belong together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way cause it wasnt meant to be 
 Now its you and her I see 
 You were my first and worst love 
 And so it only could go wrong 
 But aint that just the way you learn 
 Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know 
 That someone else has stolen my heart 
 And now another girl has caught your eye 
 That doesnt mean I dont think of you 
 I am just hoping that shell treat you right 
 Do you remember 
 How we walked the street to the beach 
 Hand in hand and you and me 
 That we belonged together you and me against the world 
 But we found out the hard way cause it wasnt meant to be 
 Now it is you and her I see 
 It was just a silly dream 
 Hey Michel do you rememberI feel completely disconnected from the world Im living in 
 I try to understand the way Im thinking 
 Keep all options open Id rather wait and see 
 Whats gonna happen next 
 Yeah I like to wait and see 
 Yeah I like to wait 
 I choke on all the information 
 That keeps getting thrown at me 
 How do you decide what to do 
 With all the complications all the doubts 
 Do you want it with or without 
 So now you just wait and see hey 
 Now you just wait 
 Please dont be mad 
 But I already miss you 
 It doesnt matter anyway 
 I hope you missed your your runaway train 
 I wake to find myself asleep 
 Weiry of life 
 I laugh Ill moan Ill cry 
 And Ill try not to wait 
 No dont be mad 
 Cause I already miss you 
 Lets hope you missed your your runaway train 
 Your runaway train 
 But anyway

 Its such a shame 
 Anyway

 And I I I 
 I feel completely diconnected from the world Im living in 
 Whats gonna happen nextHere if its any consulation take mine 
 No no need for explanations its all right 
 With me it would only be redundant see 
 If you only try to keep it all inside 
 I lay me down with your decision 
 Blow your mind dont hesitate 
 This devil takes your pain away 
 Take mine 
 But now that I have finally found you 
 Im gonna take it one step at a time 
 Lets try to keep this good thing going 
 You tell a joke I nearly die 
 We have to laugh until we cry 
 Take mine please take mine 
 My margarita chum thats what you are 
 Im laughing my ass off when you sing 
 Everybodys happy now 
 The Lunaqueens become the lunatics 
 While Janis Joplin tells her friend 
 Hes just a onenightstand 
 Yeah 
 I hear you retching in my bathroom but I dont mind 
 No Ill clean it up tomorrow just sit down 
 Again you choke me when you grumble 
 You and me were so much like RG 
 And now Ill show you how to tango 
 I think its time for us to say 
 That this has been a perfect day and retire please retire 
 My margarita cum thats what you are 
 A vip is what you are to me 
 I love it when you take me on your lonely Sunday strollWhen your world comes crashing down 
 Dont waste no time 
 No this worlds big enough for you and me 
 And when you need someone to hold 
 Theres always someone around 
 Help help them to help you 
 Cause when youre down 
 Stand up again 
 Breathe in 
 And when youre down 
 Come up again breathe in 
 When you feel youre tumblin down 
 Youll be back upon your feet again 
 When you need someone to hold 
 Yeah when youre down 
 Hold on 
 Soon your eyes will see the sun I believe in love 
 Is it worth the tears you cry what about the love 
 You should leave the past behind do you believe in love 
 You are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in what you waiting for 
 Breathe in you are never to far gone to try 
 Breathe in soon your eyes will see the sun again 
 And again and againIts funny how situations change 
 My imaginations playing games 
 I keep letting you back in my head 
 The glitter is gone spread your wings and fly 
 Ill try to keep it civilized 
 Baby all I wanted was you 
 Hold on hold on 
 Theres more to come 
 Hold on lost one 
 Cause theres some more 
 No ones ever hurt me more than you 
 I broken down in two pieces 
 And everything I sing is already been sung 
 Look at all these scars written on my skin 
 Some people find them hard to see 
 Now who will I be when 
 Im not with you anymore 
 You found yourself another place to hide 
 I cant believe that its all set and done 
 I pray to God for you your choice was right 
 The time has come for me to let us go 
 Cause theres some moreI lay my weapon down 
 Wont fight no more 
 Tryin to get you by my side 
 Though I have been in love before 
 But they could never take my clouds away 
 Babe if you were mine 
 I wont hesitate at all 
 You just let me know 
 Ill be the one to catch your fall 
 Anything you need 
 Dont keep me away 
 You make me so confused 
 The one I love loves someone else 
 Dont stop the music it feels good 
 It keeps my mind of me missing you 
 Keep the rain away 
 Theres nothing for me here 
 Without you by my side 
 Cause babe if you were mine 
 Baby whats it gonna be 
 Is it gonna be her or me 
 Tell me that I have to do 
 Cause I know that Im good for you 
 And Babe if you were mine 
 If you were mine 
 If you were mineIts good to see you after all this time 
 Its good to know that you are doing fine 
 But I cant help but notice in a bar on Friday night 
 There is something you should tell me 
 But your driver waits outside 
 Youre moving on youre going to a bigger world 
 Youre moving on youre ready for the universe 
 Its meaningless to me 
 Cause youre not here to see 
 The bigger side of me 
 I swear I saw a tear roll down your face 
 But theres a lot of smoke in bars these days 
 All I notice is the light that shines upon you from aside 
 Getting jealous of the coffee in the cup you hold so tight 
 Youre moving on to God knows where 
 Send me a postcard when youre there 
 Will I remember 
 What will it say 
 The weather is nice today 
 The bigger side of meIts easier not to be wise 
 And measure these things by your brains 
 I sank into Eden with you 
 Alone in the church by and by 
 Ill read to you here save your eyes 
 Youll need them your boat is at sea 
 Your anchor is up youve been swept away 
 And the greatest of teachers wont hesistate 
 To leave you there by yourself 
 Chained to faith 
 I alone love you 
 I alone tempt you 
 Fear is not the end of this 
 I alone love you 
 Its easier not to be great 
 And measure these things by your eyes 
 We long to be here by His resolve 
 To cradle the baby in space 
 And leave you there by yourself 
 I alone love you 
 OH now we took it back too far 
 Only love can save us now 
 All these riddles that you burn 
 All come running back to you 
 All these rhythms that you hide 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 I alone tempt you 
 Yeahahoohyeahah ooh 
 I alone love youIm sorry for the times that I made you scream 
 For the times that I killed your dreams 
 For the times that I made your whole world rumble 
 For the times that I made you cry 
 For the times that I told you lies 
 For the times that I watched and let you stumble 
 Its too bad but thats me 
 What goes around comes around youll see 
 That I can carry the burden of pain 
 Cause it aint the first time that a man goes insane 
 And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life 
 Im suckin out his love cause I Ill never be nobodys wife 
 Im sorry for the times that I didnt come home 
 Left you lyin in that bed alone 
 Was flyin high in the sky when you needed my shoulder 
 Youre like a stone hangin round my neck see 
 Cut it loose before it breaks my back see 
 Ive gotta say what I feel before I grow older 
 Im sorry but I aint gonna change my ways 
 You know Ive tried but Im still the same 
 Ive got to do it my own way 
 Its too bad but hey thats me 
 Im suckin out his love I Ill never be nobodys wife 
 Im suckin out his love I Ill never be nobodys wifeThe words are slowly sinking in 
 Despair comes unexpected 
 Everything falls out of place 
 Now my imagination 
 It moves in all directions 
 I can only see your face 
 Now please dont leave me 
 Im caught in the middle 
 It pulls me down to places no one goes 
 So you need to find out 
 If theres a chance for us 
 What a difference it makes 
 Waking up here without you 
 Baby we can make this right 
 The waters so much colder 
 Hours lasting longer 
 Ever since you went away 
 Having a different point of view 
 That doesnt make it right for you 
 To decide that you dont have to stay 
 No please dont leave me 
 It pulls down me to places no one goes 
 This heart cannot erase you 
 After years replace you 
 Dont you think thats kind of sad 
 We can make this rightThinking of when we were younger 
 A long long time ago 
 On the roof where we made out oeeh 
 You told me secrets cause you knew that 
 Id keep it 
 Nowadays I feel so tired 
 I really dont understand 
 Of all the things you do and say oeh 
 Will you be just a reminder 
 Of what weve lost on our way 
 Can I say something 
 Baby I am wishing on the stars above 
 That your eyes will finally open up 
 Cause there was nothing 
 Enough to make another part of me believe 
 That you headed me blind not to see that 
 This was love this was love 
 When I hear you tryin call me 
 In the middle of the night 
 I wont answer cause Im scared oeh 
 That I rather had you with me 
 As I 
 I never thought of me without you 
 Of me living alone 
 You turned yellow in to grey oeh 
 Do you know how long I waited 
 For you to come my way 
 That you headed me blind 
 Ooh an I say something 
 And there was nothing 
 That you had me blind not to see that 
 This was love my loveOh some things are better left unsaid 
 Youll find a nice place to hide them 
 But days like this 
 There is just too much going on yeah 
 So Im picking up the pieces of my past 
 But I cant find no peace at all 
 So in other words 
 I am so ready to be found 
 So Ill try and I might 
 Stand up and fight 
 To leave this place someday 
 All I need is that moment 
 To make me believe that youre alive 
 And then Ill be alright alright 
 Paradise grown cold 
 One hand on my door 
 Way too high hopes 
 I cant tell right from wrong 
 Show me how its done 
 Lord I need to be saved 
 And then Ill be alright alright yeah 
 Oh yeah on days like these 
 There is just too much going on 
 So I try and I might 
 All I need is this moment 
 And then Ill be alright 
 And then Ill be alright yeahAll good things come to an end 
 Thats why I block my heart 
 And chain it to the wall 
 Cause you havent been there at all 
 In time my house became a place 
 Where the wrongs were right 
 And the rights were wrong 
 With too much drama and pain 
 But tell me are you proud of who I am 
 And can you please help me understand 
 Why you couldnt love me back 
 Forgiveness aint that hard to grasp 
 Daddy I need to hear you say 
 I I never meant to hurt you 
 Baby girl youve got to believe me 
 I never meant to break your heart 
 I I just wanted to love you 
 Somehow I didnt know how to 
 I still blame myself 
 Unable to receive the love 
 And affection from you 
 Like a daughter should 
 It did far more damage than good 
 Holding grudges are a waste 
 And life is way too short 
 And I just want to let go 
 Of all the things that I cant change 
 Baby girl youve got to believe me 
 I I never meant to break your heart 
 I just wanted to love you 
 But somehow I didnt know how to 
 If I had just one more day 
 No more promises well make 
 I would hold you tight 
 And tell you I love you anyway 
 You should have been there 
 You should have been there for me 
 You sure didnt care for me 
 Where were you babyIf roses are meant to be red 
 And violets to be blue 
 Why isnt my heart meant for you 
 My hands longing to touch you 
 But I can barely breathe 
 Starry eyes that make me melt 
 Right in front of me 
 Lost in this world 
 I even get lost in this song 
 And when the lights go down 
 That is where Ill be found 
 This musics irresistible 
 Your voice makes my skin crawl 
 Innocent and pure 
 I guess you heard it all before 
 Mister Inaccessible 
 Will this ever change 
 One thing that remains the same 
 Youre still a picture in a frame 
 I get lost in this world 
 I get lost in your eyes 
 Thats where Ill be found 
 Yeah yeah 
 Am I the only oneWho is the one that makes you happy 
 Who is the one that always makes you laugh 
 Who is the reason you were smiling 
 And dragged you through these times so rough 
 I was the one that made you happy 
 I was the one that eased the pain 
 But Im the reason that youre crying now 
 My own tears scattered by the rain 
 You can sacrifice me 
 You can set me free 
 You can be who you wanna be 
 Deeper than deep you took me on a trip baby 
 You shared your wildest dreams and more 
 You dare me to express my feelings to you 
 I never felt that need before 
 But suddenly you needed freedom 
 You felt the need to break free 
 You started drowning in your sorrow 
 You didnt wanna know I had the key 
 You can sacrifice me sacrifice me 
 You can be who you wanna 
 You can be who you wanna beAha aha 
 Did you ever wake up in the morning 
 With a freighttrain running through your head 
 An empty whiskey bottle by your pillow 
 And a burned out unfinished cigarette 
 The night went up in smoke 
 Life is but a joke man 
 But I see nobody laughing nobody laughing 
 Did you ever live a day 
 Like the next day would never come 
 Bloods dripping on the floor but who cares 
 Who needs you anyway youre a stranger to yourself 
 And this aint no joke man 
 But I cant stop laughing yeah 
 Greedy angry people make me 
 Run around in circles backwards 
 Down the lonely road that keeps me 
 Run around in circles 
 How I want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead me 
 I just want to try again 
 Excuse me can you lead the way 
 Just take me by the hand 
 How I want to yeah 
 I wanna try again yeah 
 Did you ever find yourself drowning 
 In a dark and crowded bar 
 The barman keeps on pouring and youre kissing everyone 
 The night will never end 
 Cause my horse is still saddled up 
 Thats why I am still laughing 
 Try how I want to 3x How I want to how enzYou you you make me live my 
 Happy heart 
 To my love 
 And now youre gone 
 Since I fell for you 
 Love brings my misery pain 
 Cause Ill never be the same 
 Since I fell for you yeah baby 
 Since your loveNo one can hear me cause no one is around 
 But I still hear your whisper in the dark 
 I know I can go I know I can leave when ever I please 
 But time is a jailer for me 
 A face in the window looking inside 
 But no one else sees it I know 
 And now that youve found that the years have changed 
 What the ending will be 
 Times just a jailer for me 
 I shut out the light 
 Alone in the dark 
 This time of night 
 Is the hardest part 
 I still hear the whisper your heels on the floor 
 I wait for the sound of your key in the door 
 But its only the sound of nothing at all and so it must be 
 That time is a jailer for me 
 Times just a jailer for meIm the true blonde proud wigger 
 Born and raised in the suburbs yeah 
 Became a rock and roll singer 
 Been trying to find my way going uptown 
 Hard work and determination 
 I never asked for anything 
 No higher education 
 Stood up tired of waiting 
 So many choices and illusions 
 Smack flow just to survive 
 All blues but no solutions 
 Struggle each day just to stay alive 
 It aint just image I create 
 Dont fill your judgement full with hate 
 It aint worth it 
 Im the true blonde proud wigger 
 Became a rock and soul singer 
 Tried to find my way going uptown 
 Bring on that revolution 
 My kids brown sugared skin 
 People jumping to conclusions 
 Letting me know I was made to sin 
 Im so done with moderation 
 You look around but you never look up 
 No intelligent conversation 
 Ill eat dirt but I wont shut up 
 I tried to find my way going uptown 
 True blonde proud wigger 
 True blonde proud wiggerThey say that sometimes 
 Youve got to pick up arms and fight 
 For what you believe is right 
 Some say Thats just not the way 
 You will only make things worse 
 So I close my eyes and turn my head away 
 And I hope itll be all right 
 Fall into a restless sleep 
 While so many innocent die 
 Thats why I sing yeah 
 Hail to all of us 
 Hail to all of us down here 
 Maybe someday soon 
 When weve thought things over 
 Well know what to do but probably 
 Theres a much bigger chance you see 
 That it will all be gone gone 
 And just hope itll be all right 
 While so many others die 
 Yeah yeah 
 New York City London Jericho 
 Jerusalem Sydney 
 Anywhere you wanna go 
 Cape Town to the moon and back again well 
 Hail to all of us down here yeah 
 They say that sometimes 
 For what you believe is rightIm telling you it was a long way down 
 Heaven and hell 
 And all the people that I have loved 
 Disappeared somehow 
 Now I just did what I have been taught 
 Covering up my soul 
 For those who do not need me 
 I must go on 
 I lay it down 
 When you walked I walked right with you 
 You know I was always around 
 Tell me where did it all went wrong 
 Im running wild 
 Is it the things that I might have said 
 I only wish I knew 
 Now that the next waves come in slow 
 So I can still glide 
 Now take me to the one I love 
 With my head held high 
 Now lay it down 
 I guess I forgive you 
 I guess that I miss you 
 I cant help myself hey wait 
 No I dont wanna be alone the rest of my life 
 Now dont go cause its too hard for me to 
 Lay it downI got my head in the clouds 
 Running from the thunder 
 Proud as I can be I am 
 Waiting for the grey to replace the black in me 
 Daddy will the sun come up again 
 You and me we fail to see 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 Its plain to see you will agree 
 Its hard to stay together 
 Will we keep the thieves away 
 Will we both remember 
 To make the best of every chance 
 Or will we just surrender 
 Shouldnt we be making 
 Any effort needed to 
 Stop our dreams from fading 
 The sky is fading black to blue 
 We should be together 
 I am runnin out of faith 
 And it takes something more each time 
 Before I put my heart in your hands daddy 
 You and me did we fail to see 
 No one stays together 
 No it wont be easy 
 You will agree 
 To make this a forever 
 Fading fading fading fading oohIve got time to think about 
 The things you think about when 
 Youve got time to spare 
 Wonder why were here 
 And I wonder when or where it might go wrong 
 I wonder why I went along with you 
 Why I forgot to think 
 Forgot to think it through 
 I wonder why I 
 I wonder why 
 You go on you go on you go on pushing yourself 
 You keep you keep on you keep on fooling yourself 
 You dont know why you dont know 
 You dont know how you just dont know 
 You keep on I keep on fooling myself 
 Theres a time and place for everything 
 A time to act a time to dream 
 Theres time to wait 
 But no time to waste 
 You keep on I keep on fooling myself myself myself myself myselfTimes ticking and its crawling forward 
 Turns boys into men its awkward 
 The good life 
 Time to live and a time to die 
 A time to fall and a time to fight 
 Every word is just another lie 
 I wonder why I do even try 
 Im wishing that someone was near me now 
 Letting me know Im OK that Ill survive 
 Take me back ten years ago 
 When I thought 
 I lived the dream 
 My heart had been longing for 
 Tick tock so many changes 
 Going through all the stages 
 A time to hate and a time to love 
 Time makes me wait for God 
 Unknown future 
 Its scaring me 
 So now this is all that I can be 
 Instead of making a fast run 
 Trying to make this heart 
 Come undone 
 Cause time does not forget 
 What I was made for 
 So follow the stars 
 Without too many regrets 
 Times ticking and its crawling forward 
 Its a good life 
 Just a good lifeCrazy way to get your kicks 
 Shoot the silicone in your lips 
 If your figure makes you sad 
 Suck the fat right of your back 
 Make up your mind about your tits girls 
 You can puffm up so no bra will fit girls 
 Theres only one thing they cant fix 
 No I wont let you be misled 
 Thats the hole in your head 
 Can do nothing bout that 
 Hail hail modern world 
 Hail to all you boys and girls 
 Hail hail the colour green 
 Hail hail to what Ive seen 
 Hail hail hail this modern world 
 Tell her that shes beautiful 
 And put her on a Pedestal 
 But as you google triple X 
 Imagination kicks in 
 The more you think about sex boys 
 With someone else the better it gets boys 
 You have a purpose in your life 
 Besides cheating on the wife 
 For fuck sakes show some sense 
 These days adoption is a hot thing 
 You can get a child for nearly nothing 
 You take them home to a nanny 
 Buy off your guilt with toys and candy 
 But all the money that you work for girls 
 You cant compare it to love boys 
 And thats the hole in you head 
 Cant do nothing bout that 
 Hail hail the color green 
 Yeah Yeah YeahRelationship lost on a stormy sea 
 I hold on to you 
 Just hold on to me 
 When the lighting strikes 
 You hear the thunder roaring 
 And you dont know how long 
 This will go on 
 But I know I still love you 
 And I know you still care 
 So keep on tryin 
 When youre sure you still love me 
 I dont know much 
 But I know how to love you 
 Doesnt that mean anything 
 A sea of love 
 Dont let it drown us 
 Were way too far from shore 
 As we go deeper 
 As the wind grows stronger 
 It tries to tip us over 
 But we both learned how to swim 
 So lets just go on 
 Cause I know I still love you 
 Yeah I know I still love you 
 But I know how to love you yeah 
 And thats all I need to know 
 Yeah thats all I need to know babe 
 Oh thats all I need to know 
 Thats all I need to know 
 For nowI remember you stepped in the store 
 And you kept me standing in one place for way too long 
 There you smiled at me but all that I could say was just 
 Hello sir what will it be 
 Youre a Jesus with shoes on 
 I can see the light in your hair 
 Its happening again 
 Ooh baby 
 Well have you told your mom 
 That you wont be coming home 
 Dont you worry now 
 She can do it on her own 
 You shot me 
 In my heart 
 And I just wanna be 
 Your woman 
 Now were all alone 
 You make me lose my cool 
 I cant deny it and I cant pretend 
 What I see is what I get 
 Your arms around me 
 Here we stand 
 Now I believe that we can make it through 
 Take me as I am its up to you 
 Can you see the things that nobody else can see 
 Think it over now that you still can 
 Are you though enough to be my man 
 Or will you also try to walk away anyway 
 That you wont be coming back 
 Boy you look so fine baby how about upstairsYou grabbed my hand and twisted it so you had your way 
 No need to compromise cause youll find the right words to say 
 And Ill give it half a chance 
 Alone together all alone together all alone 
 Alone no more its Wednesday night 
 Someone is gonna treat me right 
 No not my man gets me this high 
 Its gonna be my neighbour at number 29 
 I think Ill pack my bags and Ill leave it all behind 
 Im gonna leave it all behind 
 No need to compromise cause these are the right words to say 
 Give it half a chance 
 You know I was talking to my neighbour at number 29 
 No not my man Its not my man who gets me high 
 You know its funny 
 Alone no moreSee that girl see her standing in the corner 
 On her own scarred inside shes a loner 
 Nobody can hear her crying at night 
 And see that all her smiles are tears 
 And she wears a mask to hide all her lies 
 To comfort all the fears 
 But when the suns starting to fade 
 Cause tonight all the men in the street will tell her 
 That she is beautiful 
 Yes she is beautiful 
 She is beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 Shes a lonely girl with cold hard eyes 
 Who doesnt know whats right 
 Beyond any doubt wants to break out 
 And live another life 
 Well Im not saying it would be very easy 
 But you have to understand 
 All she needs is someone to set her free 
 And take her heart with gentle hands 
 When the suns starting to fade 
 She is beautiful yeah yeah 
 Yeah she is beautiful 
 Yeah she is so beautifulI close my eyes 
 And imagine youre here 
 Did it all seem so hopeless 
 Given the chance 
 I would ask 
 Forgive me 
 I didnt do a thing to make you stay 
 I didnt say a word to make you stay 
 If I would have known 
 Could I have tried to make it easier 
 But I didnt do a thing 
 Or say a word 
 One word 
 And I dont know why youre gone now youre gone 
 No beautiful goodbye 
 You will never leave my mind 
 And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams 
 Now youre 
 Youre a star in heaven 
 My thoughts unsaid 
 Stuck in my head 
 And it all feels so useless 
 Never forget 
 To give all I have 
 I couldnt do a thing to make you stay 
 And I couldnt say a word to make you stay 
 If I could have known 
 But I couldnt do a thing 
 Yeah youre a star in heaven 
 Still I dont know why youre gone now youre gone 
 Youre a star in heaven now 
 Yeah youre my starTheres gonna be a yellow moon tonight 
 Dont leave the light on 
 Beads of sweat running down my face 
 You can catch them with your tongue 
 Colours run up and down your body 
 Every time you move 
 Every time every time 
 When I kiss the pictures on your skin 
 Make me shiver with the fire 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skin 
 A pair of eyes that stare across the room watching you breathing 
 Magic signs scratched inside a heart 
 Filled with your name 
 The reds the blues the greens and the greys 
 All bleed their colours through a sweaty haze 
 And we slide like a serpent on silky sheets and that twist and turn 
 Forever and ever and ever 
 Soft as a butterfly stings like a bee 
 Let me kiss the pictures on your skinYou ask me what is on my mind 
 You notice theres a change 
 Theres something different 
 Different in the way I look at you today

 To help me out 
 And though my pain keeps on showing 
 They take the time 
 And realize I do love them now hear me out 
 Cause Im singing this song for you 
 And this is my way of letting you know and say 
 Thank you 
 In this world 
 No one can replace you 
 Nobodys ever going to erase you 
 Nobodys ever going 
 To all the men that I loved in my life 
 Thank you for letting me know I aint always right 
 Back in the days there was nothing I wouldnt do 
 I went through all of the fires to be with you 
 And though I was getting tired 
 Of the same old thing 
 You all took me places Ive never been 
 And I love you for that 
 Nobodys ever going to erase you yeah 
 When no one else is around 
 I stay with you 
 Whether youre up or youre down 
 Thats what Ill do 
 Nobodys ever going to erase youJust because 
 I may act like I know everything in life 
 It doesnt mean my hands dont shake 
 Got burning eyes 
 Inside I die 
 Look around the dawn of grace 
 Im living in the last days 
 I couldnt tell the rights from wrongs 
 Its all the same 
 I live for is dreams I fear 
 The truth is that I dont know nothing 
 And I dont know why 
 All the answers I dont have 
 Make me feel so worthless 
 God knows what lies ahead 
 So unreal 
 As I rely on lies instead of what I feel 
 Overwhelmed by modern days 
 Is there a right place in this life 
 I couldnt tell 
 In fact I dont know nothing 
 No I dont know why 
 God knows what lies aheadHell begins all in the mind 
 And so you pray for inner light 
 I know youre feeling left behind 
 But please dont say that nothings ever right 
 Cause every now and then somebody will just come along 
 To take you out of the light 
 Dont try to make them love you 
 Never cherish wrong thoughts 
 Dont criticize 
 That some of us aint got no joy 
 They aint got no love 
 Yeah they aint got no life 
 Heaven is what you create 
 Just think something good 
 And youll begin to rise 
 And dont look back at yesterday 
 Its understood 
 That if you seek youll find 
 Every now and then somebody will just come along 
 Dont criticize 
 Now I feel for them 
 Yeah I feel for them 
 I feel for them 
 I feel badly for them 
 Cause theyre missing out on life 
 Yeah theyre missing out on life 
 Thats no life thats no life 
 No lifeDont you ever try to leave me 
 I wouldnt know what to do 
 And I know this life aint easy 
 But we will make it through 
 Stop for a minute baby 
 I will go anywhere 
 Take all the time you need 
 As long as Im with you I dont care 
 Lets run away together and never look back 
 As long where we can be alone out of the black 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose track 
 Kiss me til my lips are numb 
 Squeeze my heart until it breaks til it breaks 
 Im not afraid of the burden song 
 No I will do whatever it takes 
 Stop the pity and the sorrow 
 Come here you will see 
 We can have fun tomorrow 
 In a place where its just you and me 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 And we will start something new 
 And leave everything behind 
 Cause I have never stopped loving you 
 If only we could turn back time 
 As we can watch the sun go down and lose trackThe sounds of the world escape me 
 The moments you crack 
 Now youre driving 
 Down the highway of regrets 
 Youre a victim 
 Of your appetite 
 Promises broken 
 Youre that restless kind 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Stop this from pullin us under 
 Baby no one can do this but you 
 Blue dreams about you 
 My eyes wide open 
 You think you lost it 
 My heart for you 
 The sphere of youre not being here with me 
 You move in slow motion 
 Stopping rewind 
 Back to better times 
 Only you can stop this 
 But you Hey 
 Only you only you can stop this 
 Only you only you can stop this yeah yeah 
 Only you only you can stop this yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Only you come on baby 
 Yo baby only you can stop this hahahaDay in day out keep it out of sight 
 The things we do without a thought 
 It never has to end 
 Draw the blinds entertain yourself 
 Cause theres no room for someone else 
 Just leave the world outside 
 Now do we even care 
 We all just walk around in a daze 
 Not knowing what its all about 
 Now baby wouldnt it be great 
 If we could turn it all around 
 Careless people will remind you 
 Were losing grip and need a shift 
 Theres no easy way out 
 Some will tell you that theres nothing wrong 
 Just get on with what you want 
 Day in day out keep it out of sight 
 One controls all that he sees 
 Would you like to see me crawling 
 One is what he wants to be 
 But he feels hes only fallin down 
 Ones in paradise 
 One searches his way back home 
 Well I say 
 One is cool 
 One is tired 
 One is smart 
 One is crying 
 One is dead 
 One is high 
 Did I wake up in time 
 We all are lost inside the maze 
 We cant find our way home 
 If we could turn it aroundThis aint my home anymore 
 My beating heart and restless mind in woe 
 My eyes have closed on my way back home 
 To a place that no one knows 
 I travel light no more starless nights 
 Makes me shine from head to toe 
 Ive got places to go in this life 
 Ive got places to go anytime 
 Whats yours aint mine anymore but somehow 
 The roads I travel feel like home right now 
 Aint my home anymore 
 Ive got places to go places to go 
 Aint my home anymoreIf I had nothing 
 Would you die for me 
 If I ever lose my mind 
 Would you fight for me 
 Cause lately you 
 Havent been around 
 I am still waiting babe 
 To be found 
 Do any of your ladies ever get tired 
 Tired of being strong 
 Still trying to make things right 
 When hes going to long 
 No I wont play that game no more 
 Cause you will never know how bad it hurts 
 When my love isnt shattered in pieces on the floor 
 I wont play that game no more 
 No more tears on my pillow case 
 Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made 
 You made 
 The nights so cold 
 And I am all alone 
 And I have been way to long 
 On my own 
 Probably you 
 Couldnt care less 
 If I would sufficate 
 From loneliness 
 Not knowing where you stand 
 But still you can help yourself 
 From nothing than me 
 No more tiers on my pillow case 
 Think about all your lies 
 As I walk away from you 
 Leaving me here to cry 
 Theres nothing left to do 
 So get out of my life 
 I wont make up my mind no 
 I had enough 
 No moreI will help myself if you dont have the time 
 It aint hard to find a new lover 
 Now its your loss baby better check your mind 
 What you got dont cover my needs 
 Cant help myself when I start to show a sign 
 I need love its like an addiction 
 Id hurt myself 
 If I dont get away 
 I got to get myself a greater sensation 
 I need more then you could give me 
 Dont you know that Im a lovedrunk 
 Careful now before Ill break your heart 
 I will charm you with my own style 
 Long enough to make you think Im yours 
 Dont make me wait cause that would be a crime 
 It is easier to find me another 
 Ill find someone and I will get what is mine 
 I keep looking for the better connection 
 Ill help myself if you dont have the time 
 Watch me boy Im out on a mission 
 You dont give me all that I need 
 So I continue with my little obsession 
 I need more than you could give me 
 Long enough to make you think youre mine 
 Listen baby theres something I gotta tell ya 
 Im a lovedrunk 
 Im on a mission baby 
 Im so intoxicated 
 Im so bad 
 Either way yeah Im gonna get it get itLost in time I cant count the words 
 I said when I thought they went unheard 
 All of those harsh thoughts so unkind 
 Cause I wanted u 
 And now I sit here Im all alone 
 So here sits a bloody mess tears fly home 
 A circle of angels deep in war 
 Weak as I am no tears for uX2 
 Deep as I am Im not ones fool 
 Weak as I am 
 So what am I now Im loves last hope 
 Im all of the soft words I once owned 
 If I opened my heart thered be no space for air 
 Deep as I am Im no ones fool 
 In this tainted soul  
 In this weak young heart  x 3 
 Am I too much for u  
 Weak as I amx4 am am 
 Weak as I am  
 Am I too much for you  x3 
 Weak as I amWalking through September rains unknowing 
 How you come around is that guilt still growing 
 As you slowly fade away 
 You were standing tall but thats the past 
 As many other things they do not last 
 Though I had to step away 
 Im wondering are you lonely 
 Ever since you walked away 
 Its so clear 
 Cause when youre in a shower all alone 
 Thats when you fall down 
 Not able to stand up again 
 At night as you turn down the sheets 
 Thats when you feel your mind 
 When its trying to go back in time 
 You dont even know how it all started 
 Still begging for my love now we have parted 
 At night as youre turning down the sheets 
 When its trying to go back in timeI know youve been lying boy 
 Every single word you say 
 Its the way your lips shake 
 When youre 
 Getting down and dirty baby 
 Dont you ask me how I know 
 And why its time for you to go 
 Cause you shouldve known better 
 Before you were 
 I know I aint supposed to cry 
 But I cant keep it inside 
 Cheater 
 Thinking you could get away 
 But you dont know who youre dealin with 
 All the love we had is gone 
 You gave it to the other ones 
 Youre neve gonna find a love like mine 
 The way Im 
 Now youre crying on my phone 
 You shouldve done that months ago 
 And now its time for me to get 
 No 
 You dont 
 I let you buy just a little time 
 So I could find a way to say goodbye 
 A little more time before I slam the door in your face 
 So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie awake 
 Cheater yeah 
 No you dont know who youre dealin with dirty boy 
 Goodbye baby 
 Bye bye bye bye 
 No you dont know who youre dealin with dirty boyAll you ever do is 
 Letting it all just pass you by 
 No need to try 
 All you ever say is 
 Baby its alright now 
 All you ever do is 
 Letting the hurt crawl up inside 
 No need to cry 
 Baby I feel just fine 
 What do you think of me 
 Dont you think I see 
 That youre just hiding from me 
 That youre just lying to me 
 Do you think Im blind sucker 
 Open up your eyes 
 Youve got to learn to cry 
 Baby thats alright baby 
 Open up your open up your eyes 
 Maybe youll feel just fine 
 All I ever do is 
 Waitin for you to tell me why 
 You never try 
 All I ever say 
 Could you tell me why 
 Hoping that you will tell me why 
 You never cry 
 All I ever say is 
 Baby its alright its alright for you to cry 
 Maybe youll feel just fineWell you know Ive got this problem  
 Cause there is you 
 No matter how I try to tell you you just cant see 
 Oh no I wont get through 
 Youve got a body and a brain 
 Instead of pointing to another 
 Take a look at yourself 
 Why dont you just use that thing inside you head 
 And try to tell me why 
 Youre free to speak could you explain 
 The reason for your narrow mind 
 Youre thinking medieval times 
 Your ignorance just gets you scared 
 Of everything and I dont know 
 Which way the wind is blowing 
 Hoping it will blow your fears away 
 Im sure Ill never solve this problem 
 But I hope you will 
 Ill speak my mind and tell you 
 Time and time again 
 Though I wont get through 
 Blow your fears away 
 Time and time and time and time again 
 But I cant get through baby 
 Let me explain 
 Hoping it will blow your fears awayI guess this time 
 Ive had more than enough 
 You allowed my mind 
 To think theres no true love 
 Baby youre out of line 
 Wasting all my time 
 Now find your own 
 To brighten up your life 
 I got a dark cold feeling 
 That Ive been here before 
 The obvious aint hard to see 
 She turned around and smiled 
 In her high heel shoes 
 Standing right in front of me 
 And I said leave him alone 
 Find one of your own 
 Took me a long time 
 To find a man like mine 
 The dreamer with a right run 
 Now he aint made for you 
 Like the way I am 
 Its not for you to understand 
 And find a man of your own 
 Dont you break up my heart 
 Yeah leave him alone 
 I hate it 
 Ill need a big black hole 
 For you to fall in 
 Baby you aint coming back 
 And if you try once more 
 You get two feet in the door 
 Ill be taking you to pitch black 
 You can have my own 
 Im out of control 
 So I am asking you nicely 
 For the last time 
 To leave him alone 
 Find a man of your own 
 Dont you break up my home 
 Girl leave mine alone 
 I guess this time 
 You will allow my mind 
 To brighten up your lifeBetween these walls I used to live 
 Without receiving 
 So much that I had to give 
 Between these walls 
 There were a lot of things that Ive could 
 Have done differently 
 But it aint about the way I live 
 Its the heart that counts 
 Comfort feed embrace love and protect me 
 Aint that what Im here for you said youd be here for me 
 No matter what 
 How come it feels so cold every time 
 You step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold when youre mine 
 In the spring of 75 thats when God made a mistake 
 He took me here 
 To the wrong side 
 I guess you did the best you could 
 But never good enough 
 Cause its the heart that counts 
 Aint that what Im here for 
 You said you would die for me remember 
 How come it feels so cold every time you step into this room 
 Why does it feel so cold 
 Im freezing 
 Stuck here with this broken heart 
 All I can do is hoping for a full recovery 
 Why did you have me in the first place 
 Well Comfort feed embrace love and protect me yeah 
 Comfort feed embrace baby just respect me 
 How come it feels so cold every time 
 Comfort feed embrace love and respect me

 Thats what we do 
 We hardly sleep at all 
 Its getting late 
 Were just lying here with our mind full of thoughts 
 Awake dwelling on mistakes weve made 
 Its 5 in the morning 
 And what wed give to turn back time sometimes 
 To keep away that pain in life 
 And stop 
 And how we try to give you so much more 
 For youre my eyes pride my Fantastic Four 
 Only a mother 
 Only a mother would understand

 My falling stars when Im far away 
 Youre the ones that teach me life 
 Im telling you baby

 I was blessed by God 
 The moment He yeah 
 He sent you from above 
 So I could learn how to care and how to love 
 Youre the song inside my soul 
 Only a mother would understandTo this generation 
 We cannot forget 
 The ones that we have loved 
 The ones we left behind 
 Dont be afraid to reach out 
 This world is changing fast 
 For those who take a stand

 Dont let us pay the price grief in our life grief in our life 
 So much grief in our life

 And you are not me 
 The lengths that I will go to 
 The distance in your eyes 
 Oh no Ive said too much 
 I set it up 
 Thats me in the corner 
 Thats me in the spotlight 
 Losing my religion 
 Trying to keep an eye on you 
 And I dont know if I can do it 
 I havent said enough 
 I thought that I heard you laughing 
 I thought that I heard you sing 
 I think I thought I saw you strive 
 Every whisper 
 And every waking hour Im 
 Choosing my confessions 
 Like a hurt lost and blinded fool fool 
 Well consider this 
 Consider this the end of the century 
 Consider this as well 
 It brought me to my knees failed 
 What if all these fantasies 
 Come flailing around 
 Now Ive said too much 
 But that was just a dream

 And that was just a dream 
 Just a dream just a dream 
 Dream dream dream dreamLast time youre breaking my heart 
 Its the last time 
 Last time Im falling apart 
 Took a while to even up the score now 
 Last time baby once more 
 Last time youre breaking my heart 
 Last time once again its the 
 Last time Im on my own again 
 How could I be so blind 
 How could you take me for granted all these years 
 You kept telling me no it wont happen again 
 But every time I turn around you stab me in the back 
 Your perfect smile aint flashing anymore 
 Youre magic is gone boy 
 This time Im breaking your heart 
 Its my turn now 
 Its my turn to let you fall apart 
 Im gonna make your eyes burn 
 And what I really have learned from this 
 Is that Im never gonna follow my heart again 
 And that therere people living in this world 
 Wholl treat you like a dog like they just dont care 
 And cause I dont deserve this 
 Im gonna watch my steps before I get me some ass 
 This is this is the last time 
 But every time I turn around you stab me in the backI have drunk virginia water 
 I have dug my own gravesend 
 Set my foot ashore in new port 
 Travelled far beyond my landsend 
 And home is in my head 
 I have dived into a blackpool 
 With a maidstone around my neck 
 I just drifted into the southsea 
 With no hull beyond my deck 
 Well I have lost a wheel in barrow 
 Try to cross the no one cambridge 
 When my liverpool grey shallow 
 Had to dig more wells in turnbridgeLately Ive been feeling down 
 I dont get around much anymore 
 So I just spend my time alone 
 Waiting for the phone to ring 
 I keep thinking of you 
 I miss the language that we speak 
 When we dont even talk 
 And every time I see you smile 
 You make it all worthwhile 
 I never loved someone like this before 
 Keep staring at your picture while I try to 
 Work my way around you 
 But nothings any good 
 Cause I keep thinking of you 
 You never told me I would feel 
 Lonely without you 
 Youre not supposed to make me cry 
 You said dont you worry Im yours 
 And in a while you were gonna call me 
 Well its been six hours now 
 I got to stop thinking of you 
 I gotta stopWell if you leave in dusty twilight baby thats OK 
 Cause there are women at the bar to greet you everyday 
 And you can take them back to lie with you and visit Jamies room 
 But they can never take the pain away or brighten all the gloom 
 And if your hands are cleansed with sorrow may it help you ease your pain 
 Though the windows have a view of city rain city rain 
 And if you walk in constant sorrow and you cry for me 
 May it hit the painful memories maybe then youll see 
 That if you drown yourself in liquor because it keeps you company 
 Then just remember who youre losing and be proud to set me free 
 Because it dont take back or disagree it just make you see so hazily 
 But in the morning light your life is scattered with the wind scattered with the wind 
 Well they tell you on the telephone to let him go 
 They tell you hes a sinking ship and hes trying to pull you down 
 Don t you know that every time you call me up 
 And say you want me back you know you break my heart 
 You said you want me to come back home and try again 
 You want me to make a brand new start 
 But if wisdom says to let him go then its hell because you just dont know 
 Until youve tried to love a man whos lovin whiskey lovin whiskey 
 My baby left me for the bottle and the lure of the nightlife 
 Good times and crazy women and another glass of Tangueray 
 Until youve tried to love a man whos lovin whiskey lovin whiskeyPeople will always talk behind your back no matter what 
 But Im telling you it says nothing about you 
 It says more about their lack of emotional intelligence 
 And I know that life isnt always fair but so what 
 You just need to get back up 
 And dust off your shoes and try again and maybe again 
 Yeah well if youre feeling uptight 
 Got nothing to relate to 
 Im telling you that in time things will just go away 
 And I will show you sunshine 
 And how to appreciate life 
 Yeah I will remember you to be strong every day 
 Leave it alone better hold on tight 
 And be who you are get back up and try 
 When they make you feel that you dont belong 
 No matter what stay strong 
 Gotta keep your head up high 
 Dont give in to peoples lies 
 No just shine yeah 
 Soon therell be a brighter day 
 Come and chase those clouds away 
 Just smile just smile pretty baby 
 When tiger hearts burn bright 
 Theyll make you fight a good fight 
 The sun will not always shine for you every day 
 Just lead the way dont be shy 
 And lift your head up way high 
 Even when think you lose your faith along the way 
 Dont give in to peoples lies 
 No just shine just shine 
 Yeah just smile 
 Im telling you to always smile my love 
 Dont let anyone else tell you what is right 
 Dont let anyone else no anyone tell you what is right 
 God will applaud you for it

 Watching the stars on the big screen 
 Then he lies awake and he wonders 
 Why cant that be me 
 Cause in his life he is filled 
 With all these good intentions 
 Hes left a lot of things 
 Hed rather not mention right now 
 But just before he says goodnight 
 He looks up with a little smile at me 
 And he says 
 If I could be like that 
 I would give anything 
 Just to live one day in those shoes 
 What would I do 
 Now in dreams we run 
 She spends her days up in the north park 
 Watching the people as they pass 
 And all she wants is just 
 A little piece of this dream 
 Is that too much to ask 
 With a safe home and a warm bed 
 On a quiet little street 
 All she wants is just that something to 
 Hold onto thats all she needs 
 Yeah 
 If I could be like that what would I do 
 What would I do 
 Im falling into this in dreams 
 We run away 
 Falling inIm watching your shadow cut by the moon 
 Peacefull I wait for the dawn 
 These moments in silence are all that I need 
 The softness of hearing you breathe 
 And I know it doesnt get better than this 
 Funny it starts with just one little kiss 
 Baby all I know youre no longer alone 
 Weve started a home of our own love 
 All my love is yours youre no longer alone 
 Weve started a home of our own love 
 Your ups and your downs powers and fears

 Cause I have kinda lost my way 
 Sir will you help me get there as fast as I can 
 Tomorrow might be too late 
 Cause things aint what they used to be 
 My love for life is gone you see 
 Am I fighting things I cannot see 
 People always tellin me how sweet and simple life could be 
 They say you might as well live before you die 
 But one thing I know for sure 
 I am a danger to myself how come 
 Yeah one thing I know for sure 
 I need some guidance to get me out of this hellhole 
 Jerusalem can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem yeah 
 It took me quite some time to get into Jerusalem 
 Cause I had kinda lost my way 
 I want to save me from myself so here I am 
 I hope its not too late 
 I am so afraid to love 
 Cause of the way Ive been hurt before 
 I think by now its time for me to leave 
 Jerusalem can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
 Jerusalem can you help me find what I have lost 
 Things aint what they used to be 
 I dont wanna die this way 
 Wishing that I could turn back time 
 Wasted time there is work to be done 
 Jerusalem can you help me find what I have lost yeah yeah 
 All rightI was dreaming last night 
 A figment of my brain 
 On the downtown train 
 And we had nowhere to go 
 So we got off to take a walk 
 In the pouring rain 
 You said you rode it once 
 And you would ride it again 
 Please take me with you 
 Tom waits for the morning train 
 To take us away 
 Me and mr Tom Waits 
 Cant wait no more 
 Im wrapped around your finger 
 Two fingers on my lips 
 No need to speak 
 Cause its all in our eyes 
 When they turned out the lights 
 They gave us one for the road 
 We headed for the tracks 
 And never looked back 
 This could never be real 
 Me and mister tom waitsBeneath the burning sky I hold you gently 
 When we watch the sun go down its heavenly 
 As you begin to cry I say I love you 
 That we will meet again someday 
 I know its true 
 As birds fly by the stars are lighting up tonight 
 Your hand in mine when we say our last goodbye 
 Fire in the sky 
 Makes me feel so full of peace to feel you with me 
 Cause we have nothing more to fear nothing to hope 
 I see you take your one last breath 
 I want you to know that you are free to leave my love 
 Now let it go 
 As birds fly by stars are lighting up tonight 
 Hey hey hey fire in the sky 
 Fire fire in the skyTomorrows here a new day rushing by 
 As I try hard to hold onto the light 
 When I feel fine the day is over 
 The saddest thing of it all I dont know why 
 I wanna stay where I am 
 But then I leave 
 I really try to get along 
 And as I walk I think about every little thing 
 That happens to me 
 Dont I know 
 That lifes a pack of lies 
 Feels like I am wasting time 
 It makes me cry 
 So you think youd like to be in my shoes 
 Would you like to 
 Try and walk a day in mine 
 Would you still like to 
 I love myself 
 Yeah Im a star I got it all 
 I am right even when I know Im wrong 
 Its another crazy day 
 And why wont I shut my mouth for a while 
 And pretend that I havent lost my mind 
 Its enough to make you cry 
 Im everything you wanna be 
 As I walk I think about every little thing 
 Dont I know that lifes a pack of lies 
 I set things up to tear them down 
 Scream until it blocks the sound 
 Its how I clear my mind eventually 
 Its my way or no way at all 
 Im not afraid to lose control 
 Am I someone you would like to be 
 Would you still like to try and walk a day in mine8 years just all went down the drain 
 Ill make sure I make it up to you 
 Try not to make the same mistakes again 
 I keep my word and make it work for you 
 So what Im trying to say is 
 Theres no way to win this life aint always fair 
 And once you learn how to play it 
 You still aint there 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but dont get burned 
 But help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be free 
 Dont worry bout how it all went wrong 
 Cause it wont change the past you see 
 And despite all the things I know 
 Theres no place that I would rather be 
 Just hold on 
 What it all comes down to we will be just fine 
 But every now and then youll find out theres no way 
 Out of this troubled state of mind I say 
 Sometimes you wont understand the way they play 
 But it wont break you 
 Im gonna make you believe 
 Im gonna make you see 
 You have to love 
 The things that life is giving you my child 
 Im gonna make you baby make you make you baby 
 And Ill be here to love you 
 There we go 
 But ones you learn how to play it 
 Just hold your breath and watch the sun but baby dont get burned 
 And help the ones you love and try in your own way 
 To be freeIve been loving you 
 Without even knowing 
 Ill never forget those days 
 Three days in a row 
 You were my love 
 And I havent seen you since 
 That day 
 Im sorry baby 
 Baby boy 
 When I saw 
 You the first time 
 I knew rightaway that 
 Were connected 
 In a way yeah 
 I believed 
 That there was a way 
 Something more 
 That I could ever express 
 In my own words 
 I Just knew 
 At the time I belonged 
 To you 
 But it all felt so wrong 
 To do the things that 
 My heart gave in baby 
 Im telling you 
 Ive been loving you 
 Without you even knowing 
 Ill never forget 
 Those days 
 Im sorry babe 
 With loafs on our minds a few goodbyes 
 We could never 
 Have givin it 
 A real try 
 But you were in my head always 
 And at this point in my life 
 I just know 
 That if you let me back in 
 I wont let go 
 Of you and me standing at last 
 I just know its a matter of time 
 Before it all falls back into place baby believe me 
 Those days 
 Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby 
 Ive got the light 
 And for you I will shine 
 Just be prepared 
 For a hell of a ride 
 Dont ever die 
 By the way 
 I feel for ever seems short 
 Im begging you 
 Ooooohaah 
 And I havent seen you since that dayWill you fly as fast and free as my love can 
 Tell me who you are just let me know 
 That one day youll be shining your light on me 
 And Ill wait patiently inside the dark 
 Come on love me Im telling you I wont be far 
 Some days when I wake before the sunrise 
 Dreaming wishing I could hold back time 
 That you might might never never have to live without me 
 And we can see our life in stardust written in the sky 
 I touch the sky every night I try to find the brightest star 
 Youre waiting there for me so close but still so far 
 One day I will get my wish so I can face the day 
 Guess Ive been waiting all my life for you 
 Youll be the one making my dreams come trueI am looking for answeres to questions never posed 
 I havent got a clue Im living like a ghost 
 I cant seem to read the signs 
 Im swimming in the sand Im searching 
 I hold on to your reasons Ill hold on to my dreams 
 Its all good and bad advice cause you have to choose 
 One friend says go ahead other one says dont 
 Im searching 
 Whatever I try I cant find it 
 Wherever I roam its all gone 
 No you cant find it first you gotta lose it 
 Looking for an angle to change my point of vieuw 
 Waiting for somebody someone to relate to 
 Hoping for forgiveness Im living for love 
 Yearning for a teacher to show me what to do 
 Im learning from failure thats all that I can do 
 Working in solutions a fiction of truth 
 Keep on searching 
 No you cant find it first you gotta lose itYouve got it easy 
 But youve got the nerve to make a face 
 Although Im strugglin 
 You cant tell because I keep it caged 
 We are together 
 But I feel youre pushing me aside 
 Lend me a hand sometime 
 The thought wont even cross your mind 
 You needed to take a good look at yourself 
 Cause Im about to close up shop 
 If you need a servant go find someone else 
 Its time to step up 
 Cause If I go 
 Ill be taking more with me than you 
 Would care to lose 
 Time is up step it up 
 Or youll see me walk away 
 Just so you know 
 Nothing you can do could make me 
 Turn around again 
 Your time is up step it up 
 If were together 
 Why youre pushing me away 
 Youre taking chances boy 
 Were getting closer to the day 
 You need to take a good look at yourself 
 I said its time to step it up 
 Yeah time to step up 
 Time to step it up 
 I said its time babe to step it up 
 Step it upFeels like I have a pillow pulled over my head 
 And nearly every night I wake up gasping for air 
 As you slowly die from grief so you could bury me alive 
 And now I see you suffocate in dreams and your lies 
 Breathe in gotta breathe out 
 No fear cause they wont come around 
 Breathe in breathe out 
 Ill be all right and lay my burdens down 
 God will you forgive them 
 For they failed the leap of faith 
 Take away the pain that blinds them 
 Teach them how to love instead of hate 
 Dont they see that loves for free 
 Yes Gods got a hold on me 
 Despite the crap you put me through 
 I can say I still got love for you 
 And dont fear no they wont come around 
 Breathe in and breathe out 
 Ill be all right Ill be all right 
 Breathe in breathe out 
 Breathe in and breathe out 
 I dreamed my faith could overcome my weakness 
 It wont defeat me 
 In my heart gotta have to be this careless 
 Just let me just let me let me 
 Let me breathe baby 
 I got to breathe baby 
 Let me breathe 
 Youve gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta let me breathe yeahI beg I cry 
 Swallow all my pride 
 All that to make you stay 
 Wont you just let go 
 Honey what you do to me 
 Why you messin with my man 
 Its not only Mister Right 
 He is also my best friend 
 Must be something I can do 
 To keep him away from you 
 Cause without him theres no chance 
 I could ever love again 
 Dont you understand girl 
 Save me 
 Please dont take away my man from me 
 Cause I just wouldnt know now what to do without him 
 We both know you care please dont take my man 
 What did you just do to me 
 Stabbing me right in the back like that 
 Well have you got no dignity 
 I could never do that to you 
 Let alone to you my friend 
 And now you got me thinking 
 Baby I should take the blame 
 For letting you be such good friends 
 But it never crossed my mind 
 This could happen over time

 All that to make you stayLets say Im feeling better 
 Lets say Im feeling fine 
 Lets say I gave you all I had 
 And now Im out of time 
 And my best wasnt good enough 
 And now theres time to wonder 
 Now theres time to heal 
 Time to let it all come down 
 But I dont know what I feel 
 But it aches and it hurts and it burns 
 Oh it kills me 
 Tick tock you dont stop 
 You dont fade 
 You just stay 
 But Ill do it all again 
 Now dont you call me baby 
 Just dont pretend you care 
 Save your sorry for yourself 
 When Judas takes you there oh yeah 
 Once I really believed 
 There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely 
 But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart 
 Says youre not the only one 
 But it kills me 
 But Ill do it all againMourning through thoughts of you 
 My heavy heart 
 Cant find my way around 
 Its morning when it starts 
 You and I wanted love somewhere down the line 
 You and I All of the things that weve been through 
 Dont you know Deep down you know that I love you 
 That by know If you dont know that by now then 
 I might have to leave 
 Baby youre telling me that Im no good and I dont even care 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I can 
 Many times I am failing you cannot give what I want you 
 And if you ride my side my heart is made of stone 
 Then Im better of alone 
 Building up barricades day by day 
 Leaving me paralyzed selfish and afraid 
 I am not who I was I got broken deep inside 
 Make it feel I make you feel left out alone 
 All alone You need a place you can call home 
 Need a home What if Im finding out now 
 I cant do that anymore 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back the only way I can 
 Im trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay 
 But it doesnt work that way 
 But I am so afraid hey so afraid so afraid baby oeeh 
 Baby youre telling me that Im no good and I dont even care 
 You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I canBaby why youre so sad 
 Whats the thing youre running from 
 Caught in the red lights 
 As if money is the cure 
 Is this your only way to survive 
 Are you trying to get even with the past 
 What happened to the dreams you had 
 I think its time for you to 
 Show them you are able 
 To leave without saying one word 
 I know it wont be easy baby 
 But I will run with you 
 Cause every night has a day 
 Every wish a prayer 
 Dont lose your faith 
 And Ill be holding your hand 
 Cause its never too late 
 Theres someone who needs you 
 So break down that wall baby 
 Theres a new world out there waiting 
 Just tear down that wall girl 
 Run away and dont look back 
 Break down that wall 
 Lady its your turn now 
 Just walk the streets with your head up high 
 Oh baby doesnt that feel right 
 So put a big smile on your face 
 You walk on straight 
 Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong 
 Isnt this your sweetest revenge 
 Feels good hey I told you so 
 Every wish has a prayer 
 Theres a new world out there 
 Tear down that wall girl 
 Run away run away run away 
 Cause I need youHeaded for the heartache 
 You took my love and broke it 
 Torn it and provoked it 
 As I trusted 
 Your charming little ways 
 And all those lies of praise 
 What have you done 
 It has been a long and crazy day 
 After I unfolded your mistakes 
 And that pretty evil face 
 How did you trick me 
 Into loving you 
 Youre like poison on my soul 
 Was it worth it 
 You pushed it way too far 
 Speading rumours about my heart 
 Hey it aint right 
 No it aint right 
 And I will blame it all on you 
 For I will never dance again 
 The way I did when you were my man 
 Dont be calling me 
 Youre messing with my head 
 Im so angry but instead 
 I still want more 
 Inspite of all the lies 
 The phony alibis youve given my heart 
 The way I did when you were my manIsolated from the outside 
 Clouds have taken all the light 
 I have no control it seems my 
 Thoughts wander all of the time 
 When I try to 
 Live life without you 
 Birds falling down the rooftops 
 Out of the sky like raindrops 
 No air no pride 
 If being myself is what I do wrong 
 Then I would rather not be right 
 Hopes turned into fear and with my 
 One wing I cant fly 
 With sunrise embrace my 
 Dreams tight and thats why 
 Birds 
 To a place without fear with no moonlight 
 To a place without moonlight and fear 
 All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight 
 All I need is trees some flowers and sunlight 
 Where memories are being made 
 And where the old one dies 
 Where love aint lost 
 Thats why birds dont flyI know the drill 
 Youve got your ball and chain 
 It holds you down the circle round 
 This story stays the same 
 It wont be long 
 And then your heart is frozen 
 The time has come to break away 
 Youve got it all 
 What makes you hesitate 
 Dont just wait for things to blow up 
 In your pretty face 
 Lift the weight 
 Try not to let it slip away 
 And you may find yourself again 
 I feel 
 People just dont know you like I do 
 Why youre making it so hard to see 
 When theres something wrong 
 It goes on and on 
 I know the drill 
 I found out the second round 
 That some things never change 
 Open my eyes 
 And let the days come over me 
 And maybe itll go away 
 On and on and on Youll see 
 Not everybodys here to 
 Break your heart 
 So there is a price to pay 
 To be someone youre not 
 I know the drill youve got your ball and chain 
 And maybe itll go awayGraduated fool that is what I am 
 For every time I failed you 
 Youre so beautiful I just turned and walked away 
 I jingle with words tangle my tongue 
 Stammering stutters 
 So I wrote you this song to finally tell you 
 What youve know all along I love you 
 Believe in me believe me 
 It was true devotion now these mixed emotions 
 Oh I did it again 
 I want you to forgive me when the pain has faded 
 Well be laughing again 
 Believe in me 
 Graduated fool Im better than I am 
 For that is what you made me 
 Please hold back your tears 
 I didnt deserve you anyway 
 Believe in me I still care for you believe me 
 Just believe in me believe me 
 When I kiss your face again all these mixed emotions 
 Of pleasure and pain 
 I want you to forgive me when the pain has faded yeah 
 Well be laughing again and again and again 
 Believe in me youre so beautiful believe me 
 Just believe in me believe meDo I really want to know myself 
 Do I want to see 
 Why Im wonderin every morning 
 Whos it gonna be today 
 Staring in the mirror 
 Come tell me whos that under my skin 
 And whats the reason were here for 
 Tell me what is my own true face 
 But hey here I come 
 Im the shows main attraction 
 Im a beautiful creature 
 Yeah thats what I am 
 But the other side of me 
 I cant explain why Ive become 
 Negative as can be oh yeah 
 Im wonderin where its coming from 
 I know I cant do without it 
 Sure makes me what I am 
 So I will never stop believin 
 In that I love myself someday 
 Hey thats what I am 
 Yeah oh yeahHavent we both heard enough babe 
 This is what were gonna do 
 Let me put my arms around you once more 
 Theres nothing left here to prove 
 Walk away just a little bit slower 
 Better hold on tight will we ever learn to let it go 
 Break through to the other side 
 I keep wondering 
 When were you ever gonna let me know 
 That you just wanted something else in life 
 What do you say when its all over 
 What do you know when nothings going right 
 The troubles in your mind 
 What do you do when you get lost inside your soul 
 Where do you go when loves gone 
 What do you say nothing at all 
 It was so hard when I watched you falling down 
 But it was time for you to walk alone 
 Just know if you really need a friend 
 And youre feeling like you cant go on 
 Just walk back just a little bit faster 
 Take my hand I will blow your fears away 
 For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else 
 And Ill be by your side 
 What do you do when its all gone 
 Where do we go when loves gone 
 When it all becomes reality 
 That this is where it ends for you and me 
 Im about to lose my mind 
 Will love find a way on time 
 Please dont try and kiss these tears away 
 We know weve both have made mistakes 
 If I could do it all again 
 I wouldnt change a single thing 
 What do you say nothing at all
