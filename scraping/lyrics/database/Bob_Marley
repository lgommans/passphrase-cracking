 Swing with me, baby 
 It will be for twoHear the children cryin', 
 But I know they cry not in vain. 
 Now the times are changin'; 
 Love has come to bloom again. 
 Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops 
 Reminds us of youthful days. 
 But now it's not rain that water the cane crops, 
 But the sweat from man's brow; 
 The substance from our spine. 
 We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time: 
 Hallelujah time! 
 Yes, you can hear the children singing: Hallelujah time! 
 As they go singing by and by: Hallelujah time! 
 Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning. 
 Hallelujah time! Let them sing; don't let them cry. 
 Over rocks and mountains 
 The sheep are scattered all around. 
 Over hills and valleys, 
 They are everywhere to be found. 
 But though we bear our burdens now, 
 All afflictions got to end somehow: 
 From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough. 
 Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony? 
 We like to be free like birds in a tree. 
 Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing. 
 Hallelujah time! Yes, as they go singing by and by. 
 Hallelujah time! Oh "hallelujah" singing in the morning. 
 Let them sing; never let them cry. 
 Hallelujah time! "Hallelujah" singin' in the morningLife is too short 
 To wake up in the morning with regrets. 
 So love the ones who treat you right, 
 Forget the ones who don't. 
 And believe everything happens for a reason. 
 If you get a chance, take it. 
 If it changes your life, let it. 
 Nobody said it would be easy, 
 They just said it would be worth it.I'm a rebel, soul rebel

 Now I stand alone through the memories 
 That haunts me, that haunt 
 Yeah, and I walk alone through the rhapsodies 
 That taunts me, that taunts me, me 
 There you are, cryin' again 
 But your loveline-ness won't cover your shame 
 There you are, you're takin' true love 
 And while you're takin' true love, given the blame 
 (How could I ...) How could I be so wrong 
 To think that we could get along? 
 Days I wasted with you, child 
 If I count there'll be a million or two 
 Now I stand alone through the memories 
 That haunts me, that haunts (... me) 
 And I walk alone through the rhapsodies 
 That taunts me, that taunts me 
 Now, there you are, cryin' again 
 But your loveline-ness won't cover your sham-ame, hey 
 There you are, you're takin' true lo-love 
 While you're takin' true lo-love, given the blame 
 (How could I ...) How could I ...Four hundred years (four hundred years, four hundred years. wo-o-o-o) 
 And it's the same 
 The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy 
 I've said it's four hundred years; 
 (Four hundred years, four hundred years. wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o) 
 Look, how long (wo-o-o-o) 
 And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see. 
 Why do they fight against the poor youth of today? 
 And without these youths, they would be gone 
 All gone astray 
 Come on, let's make a move: 
 (Make a move, make a move. wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o) 
 I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come, 
 And if-a fools don't see 
 (Fools don't see, fools don't see. wo-o-o-o) 
 I can't save the youth: 
 The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong. 
 So, won't you come with me; 
 I'll take you to a land of liberty 
 Where we can live - live a good, good life 
 And be free. 
 Look how long: four hundred years, (four hundred years, four hundred years) 
 Way too long! (wo-o-o-o) 
 That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see. 
 Said, it's four hundred long years - (four hundred years, four hundred years. wo-o-o-o) 
 Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy. 
 It's been four hundred years, (four hundred years, four hundred years) 
 Wait so long! wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o. 
 How long? Four hundred long, long years.Steady rock easy

 He grabbed the hand of the spoon 
 It's just the poor brain washing and I don't need it no longer

 Until the philosophy which hold one race 
 Superior and another inferior 
 Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned 
 Everywhere is war, me say war 
 That until there are no longer first class 
 And second class citizens of any nation 
 Until the color of a man's skin 
 Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes 
 Me say war 
 That until the basic human rights are equally 
 Guaranteed to all, without regard to race 
 A dis a war 
 That until that day 
 The dream of lasting peace 
 World citizenship 
 Rule of international morality 
 Will remain in but a fleeting illusion 
 To be pursued, but never attained 
 Now everywhere is war, war 
 War in the east, war in the west 
 War up north, war down south 
 War, war, rumors of war 
 And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes 
 That hold our brothers in Angola, in Mozambique 
 South Africa, sub-human bondage 
 Have been toppled, utterly destroyed 
 Well, everywhere is war, me say war 
 War in the east, war in the west 
 War up north, war down south 
 War, war, rumors of war 
 Some winning, some losing, 
 Some dying, some crying 
 Some singing...

 It was a Buffalo Soldier 
 In the heart of America 
 Stolen from Africa, brought to America 
 Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival 
 I mean it, when I analyze the stench 
 To me, it makes a lot of sense 
 How the dreadlock rasta was the Buffalo Soldier 
 And he was taken from Africa, brought to America 
 Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival 
 Said he was a buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta 
 Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America 
 If you know your history 
 Then you would know where you coming from 
 Then you wouldn't have to ask me 
 "Who the heck do I think I am?" 
 I'm just a buffalo soldier 
 In the heart of America 
 Stolen from Africa, brought to America 
 Said he was fighting on arrival 
 Fighting for survival 
 Said he was a buffalo soldier 
 In the war for America

 Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died 
 From a stray bullet 
 Woman hold her head and cry 
 Explaining to her was a passerby 
 Who saw the woman cry 
 Wondering how can she work it out 
 Now she knows that the wages of sin is death 
 The gift of Jah is life

 Which hold one race superior and another 
 Inferior 
 Is finally 
 And permanently 
 Discredited 
 And abandoned 
 Everywhere is war 
 Me say war 
 That until there no longer 
 First class and second class citizens of any nation 
 Until the colour of a man's skin 
 Is of no more significance, than the colour of his eyes 
 Me say war 
 That until the basic human rights 
 Are equally guaranteed to all 
 Without regard to race 
 Dis a war 
 That until that day 
 The dream of lasting peace 
 World citizenship 
 Rule of international, morality 
 Will remain in but a fleeting illusion, to be pursued 
 But never attained

 War in the west 
 War up north 
 War down south
