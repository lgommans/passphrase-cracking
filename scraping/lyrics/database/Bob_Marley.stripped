 But with all he possesses self preservation comes first 
 His damnation comes from not burning free 
 As destruction of the poor is their poverty is their poverty 
 While oppression is the poor mans choice 
 Ah but in this he does rejoice 
 His burdens though heavy he somehow bears 
 As for his seed theres only one who cares 
 Theres only one who cares 
 Though his pilgrimage extends his progresses ascends 
 But as the prudent one exalts he is gonna find his faults 
 But as the wise man sees he knows he knows 
 Theres no rest in the west so to the east he goes to the east he goes

 Une race supérioure et une autre inférieure 
 Ne sera finalement et permanament 
 Discréditee et abandonée 
 Partout sera la guerre 
 Cest la guerre 
 Tant quil yaura 
 Des première clssses 
 Et seconde classes citoyens dans toutes les nations 
 Tant que le colour dun humain 
 Aura de la signification comparée à ses yeux 
 Et jen passe 
 Tant que le droits universels ne seront attribués à tous 
 Sans distinction de race Et jen passe 
 En attendant ce jour le reve deterniser la paix 
 Entre citoyens du monde 
 Ne sera quune illusion désespérée 
 Quil faudra pourtant trouver le moyen de 
 Transformer en réalité 
 Et partout cest la guerre Cest la guerre 
 Guerre à lest 
 Guerre à louest 
 Guerre au nord 
 Guerre au sud 
 Guerre Guerre Hommes de la terre 
 Mais en attendant ce jour 
 Le continent Africannaura pas de paix 
 Nous Africains nous nous battrons 
 Si cela est nécessaire 
 Et nous savons que nous vaincrons 
 Car nous sont confiant 
 En la victoire 
 La victoire finale 
 Du bien sur le mal 
 La victoire finale du bien sur le mal 
 Cest la victoire de Dieu 
 De Dieu sur le Diable

 Good Lord WAR 
 Until the philosophy which hold one race 
 Superior and another inferior 
 Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned 
 Everywhere is war me say war 
 That until there are no longer first class 
 And second class citizens of any nation 
 Until the color of a mans skin 
 Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes 
 Me say war 
 That until the basic human rights are equally 
 Guaranteed to all without regard to race 
 A dis a war 
 That until that day 
 The dream of lasting peace 
 World citizenship 
 Rule of international morality 
 Will remain in but a fleeting illusion 
 To be pursued but never attained 
 Now everywhere is war war 
 War in the east war in the west 
 War up north war down south 
 War war rumors of war

 Which hold one race superior and another 
 Inferior 
 Is finally 
 And permanently 
 Discredited 
 And abandoned 
 Everywhere is war 
 That until there no longer 
 First class and second class citizens of any nation 
 Until the colour of a mans skin 
 Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes 
 That until the basic human rights 
 Are equally guaranteed to all 
 Without regard to race 
 Dis a war 
 Rule of international morality 
 Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued 
 But never attained 
 Now everywhere is war 
 War

 Subhuman bondage 
 Have been toppled 
 Utterly destroyed 
 Well everywhere is war 
 War in the east 
 War in the west 
 War up north 
 War down south

 Rumours of war 
 And until that day The African continent 
 Will not know peace 
 We Africans will fight we find it necessary 
 And we know we shall win 
 As we are confident

 To set my people freeThe man oppressed will seem to do the worst 
 But with all he possesses self preservation comes first 
 His damnation comes from not burning free 
 As destruction of the poor is their poverty is their poverty 
 While oppression is the poor mans choice 
 Ah but in this he does rejoice 
 His burdens though heavy he somehow bears 
 As for his seed theres only one who cares 
 Theres only one who cares 
 Though his pilgrimage extends his progresses ascends 
 But as the prudent one exalts he is gonna find his faults 
 But as the wise man sees he knows he knows 
 Theres no rest in the west so to the east he goes to the east he goes 
 Where he can find peace of mind ohIn high seas or in low seas

 Ne sera finalement et permanament 
 Discréditee et abandonée 
 Partout sera la guerre 
 Cest la guerre

 Tant que le colour dun humain 
 Aura de la signification comparée à ses yeux 
 Et jen passe 
 Tant que le droits universels ne seront attribués à tous 
 Sans distinction de race Et jen passe 
 En attendant ce jour le reve deterniser la paix 
 Entre citoyens du monde 
 Ne sera quune illusion désespérée 
 Quil faudra pourtant trouver le moyen de 
 Transformer en réalité 
 Et partout cest la guerre Cest la guerre 
 Guerre à lest 
 Guerre à louest 
 Guerre au nord 
 Guerre au sud 
 Guerre Guerre Hommes de la terre 
 Mais en attendant ce jour 
 Le continent Africannaura pas de paix 
 Nous Africains nous nous battrons 
 Si cela est nécessaire 
 Et nous savons que nous vaincrons 
 Car nous sont confiant 
 En la victoire 
 La victoire finale 
 Du bien sur le mal 
 La victoire finale du bien sur le mal 
 Cest la victoire de Dieu 
 De Dieu sur le Diable

 Which hold one race superior and another 
 Inferior 
 Is finally 
 And permanently 
 Discredited 
 And abandoned 
 Everywhere is war 
 That until there no longer 
 First class and second class citizens of any nation 
 Until the colour of a mans skin 
 Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes 
 That until the basic human rights 
 Are equally guaranteed to all 
 Without regard to race 
 Dis a war 
 Rule of international morality 
 Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued 
 But never attained 
 Now everywhere is war 
 War 
 And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes 
 That hold our brothers in Angola 
 In Mozambique 
 South Africa 
 Subhuman bondage 
 Have been toppled 
 Utterly destroyed 
 Well everywhere is war 
 War in the east 
 War in the west 
 War up north 
 War down south 
 War war 
 Rumours of war 
 And until that day The African continent 
 Will not know peace 
 We Africans will fight we find it necessary 
 And we know we shall win 
 As we are confident 
 In the victory
