Make a friend of the coyote 
 He will always tell it like it is 
 Take council the bear 
 Back on the Res (reservation) 
 When we would sail the phoenix 
 Feather on the sea 
 Thunderbird at midnight 
 Per chance did meet 
 Swallow took the sun 
 From that bitter ground 
 And now we were heavy 
 With the burden of a crown 
 We are the King of Arizona 
 We are the King of Arizona 
 Townies are a helpless people 
 They are busy in their troubled games 
 Damn their parliament of needles 
 They know not a lineage of names

 But everything looks like a target to me 
 And I don't know where the gun is 
 But I'm certain that it's pointed at me 
 And in the jungle, retched jungle 
 They say the lion eats tonight 
 And all around it is a colliseum 
 Dripping with a voracious appetite

 Could've been a gull in a clipper's wake. 
 Could've been a ladybug on a windchime, 
 But she was born a dragonfly. 
 In the sun she warmed her wings 
 And listened to the cicadas sing. 
 "The trees are all bending 
 In one direction 
 Because of something..." 
 Cross-pollination by the legs of bees in the spring 
 Is a beautiful thing. 
 Oh when the sun goes down, 
 The fireflies come out. 
 In a pond crept a slimy thing 
 That hummed a theme from the Rites of Spring. 
 Pity the mate of Queen Mantis, 
 So content, but so headless. 
 Katydid nothing but shiver and cry, 
 As did the dragonfly. 
 In the shade the gypsies spin 
 Among the cloves, they drop their skin. 
 "...Beyond the hedgegrove, 
 Over by the willows, 
 Deep in the shadows..." 
 Regeneration occurs at a furious speed 
 Beneath the white oak tree. 
 Oh when the sun comes up 
 The moon buds fold up. 
 In the sun she warmed her wings 
 And listened to the Rites of Spring 
 Could've been a swan on a glassy lake. 
 Could've been a gull in a clipper's wake. 
 Could've been a ladybug on a windchime, 
 But she was born a dragonfly. 
 "...Ain't ever seen it, but I have heard it. 
 Sounds like the millstones when they are turning, 
 But every moment getting louder and louder, 
 And then there is silence, 
 And the smell of flowers."Like ravens on a scarecrow 
 Too old to beat them off

 Familiarity breeds contempt 
 The yolk of faith splatters silent 
 Harvest time, red moon rising 
 Anvil cloud, lightning rod 
 Peacemaker, life taker 
 What's inside the silo? 
 Can it fly? 
 A needle in the haystack 
 To crack the sky

 Were he not walking on his hind legs and smoking cigars 
 Recite my lineage and genealogy 
 You've got to know your history, Son of Virginia 
 Everybody's in the church believing they're a sinner 
 And looking for a sign from the True Son of Virginia 
 When the storm blew over we made our way 
 To the old hay wain to infiltrate the sarcophagus 
 By the dim light of a narrow window we saw 
 The God's honest truth staring right back at us 
 Recite your lineage and genealogy 
 You've got to know your history, Son of Virginia 
 Everybody's in the church believing they're a sinner 
 And looking for a sign from the True Son of Virginia

 Once around the stump, then twice across the ceiling, 
 Now eight times over Miss October is out for me. 
 Believe me when I tell you she's all about destruction. 
 It's just about enough to make a grown man cry. 
 Good God Almighty we was panning for gold 
 Down at the banks of mighty Colorado, 
 When all of a sudden came an awful sound; 
 Ten thousand buffalo were running us down. 
 Once again I'm denied my joy. 
 Sieves and peas, oh Lord, oh Lord! 
 Thunder and lightning at a feverish pitch. 
 Must be the workings of the Old West Witch. 
 I crossed her once when I was just a youth. 
 Been scared stiff ever since, to tell you the truth. 
 Once again I'm denied my joy. 
 Sieves and peas, oh Lord, oh Lord! 
 She went once around the stump, then twice across the ceiling, 
 Now eight times over Miss October is out for me. 
 Believe me when I tell you she's all about the voodoo. 
 And all the things I'm losing when I pay no mind. 
 Get off on the good foot and start another day. 
 Maybe head for Hazel, California. 
 Oh, but sooner or later she'll go to town 
 Sure as the Earth runs around and around. 
 Again I'm denied my joy. 
 Sieves and peas, oh Lord! 
 At the side of the road 
 A bundle of twine, 
 And on it I found a note. 
 It read, "You'll be running until the end of time." 
 She went once around the stump, then twice across the ceiling, 
 Now eight times over Miss October is out for me.

 Succotash and rudebagas. 
 Then came turkey from the oven. 
 Broke the wishbone. 
 Covenants were sealed and set.

 And I won't pretend not to mind.

 Christmas Eve we ate at Aunty's. 
 We had some ham glazed with honey. 
 Rolled the Yule log on the fire. 
 Threw the hambone to the dogs and went to bed. 
 On the losing end of a wishbone, 
 And I won't pretend not to mind.

 In the morning the weathercock was heard 
 Asking what he had learned of the Earth. 
 "Is it a round place with deserts and oceans, 
 Housing as many winds as one might wish?" 
 We were standing by the gate. 
 He said, "Oh my, it's getting late!" 
 Then he took off flying to the south 
 With a black snake in his mouth. 
 You can shake it, break it, or glue it whole, 
 But there's no two ways about it with a broke wishbone 
 On the losing end.

 For St. Patrick's we had cabbage, 
 Corned beef stew, egg salad sandwich. 
 Then came the whiskey from the basement. 
 Danced all night into the dawn, 
 Then held our heads.

 Loaded it up with Mother Earth, never got to asking why

 Just like corn-bread done too well! 
 What you need, you know I got! 
 So hands up, who wants to rock!?I was eating dinner at the table with people from the music industry. 
 They asked me if I liked it in "The City." I said I liked it better in the country. 
 The label representative asked me what about it most appealed to me. 
 "I love to listen to the yellowhammer singing 'a little bit of bread and no cheese'." 
 Then I commenced to do a tap dance on eggplant Parmesan before their eyes. 
 Guided by voices, whole bag of tricks. Raised by Druids and Horses. 
 (Then I told them): 
 "Never underestimate the power of Love. You dig my new horseshoes? 
 Never underestimate the power of Love." 
 "Come here quickly he's lost his mind!" 
 "Frightened? Well I'm not surprised, you've never seen the likes of me. 
 Check it, I want a big fat advance and my alfalfa free!" 
 "Come here quickly he's lost his mind!" 
 The manager removed me from the restaurant. A crowd got to gathering around. 
 I said, "You can throw a man out on his ear, but you can't keep a good horse down!" 
 Mounted police sprung to action. Never cut me any bit of slack. 
 But I wasn't going anywhere 'til they got off my brother's back.As through a glass darkly, you seek yourself 
 But the light grows weak while under Yggsdrasil 
 A basket of eggs may you count your days 
 Though your gut lies filled, only shells remain 
 I can tell you've been drinking by the scent of your breath 
 Another little sip, a bit deeper in debt 
 You can rest your head in your wrinkled hands 
 But when you awake, you're in another land 
 In fields of green rolling on endlessly 
 You find a fallen nest where there is no tree 
 Mark the brown furred hound tied to the mandrake root 
 Dare you carve a face in that virtue food? 
 I can tell what you're thinking, I see it everyday 
 I'll help you with your coat, see you on your way

 Look, there goes another one now, one day I swear they will not miss

 In the spirit of Spanish Inquisition.

 Mechanical monkeys make good musicians. 
 Streets urchins, the smugglers and dingos, 
 Dead languages and living man lingos. 
 Put the relics of the saint in a glass box and march him around the block.

 To gain an explanation, 
 They find only terminal verse.

 I've got the urge, I've got the urge 
 To clean up this place of your scourge 
 If cleanliness is next to Godliness 
 Then that would make you the devil 
 Call it what you will, a pre-emptive strike 
 But the first law of nature is to defend one's life 
 You're just a semi-automatic hate machine 
 Semi-automatic hate machine 
 Semi-automatic hate machine 
 And I've gone ballistic 
 Mine eyes have seen the glory 
 Mine eyes have seen the glory 
 Grapes of wrath 
 Grapes of wrath 
 You're just a semi-automatic hate machine 
 Semi-automatic hate machine 
 Semi-automatic hate machine 
 And I've gone ballistic 
 And you're just a statisticRise now my son 
 You were suffering from a horrible dream 
 So mend your ways before they tear you by the seams 
 You're not the first and not the last 
 So take this relic of the beloved past 
 Take it now, It's yours, pass it on, preserve 
 This undeniable heritage of yours 
 So take this heirloom 
 So take this heirloom 
 So take the heirloom 
 So take the heirloom 
 But I don't want it 
 And I don't need it 
 So you can keep it 
 So you can keep it 
 I don't want it, I don't need it 
 Take your heirloom to hell 
 I will not fulfill your prophecy 
 Because this heirloom, it burns like a scar 
 The call denies the branding iron at last 
 I don't want it 
 I don't want it 
 I don't want it 
 I don't want itEverything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right, yeah 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right, yeah 
 I went deep down into that river now 
 I rose up 
 And I felt that sun beat down upon this sinner's face, yeah yeah 
 And I went deep down in that water now 
 I rose up 
 I felt that sun beat down upon my face, yeah yeah 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right, yeah yeah 
 Everything gonna be all right

 Here we go! 
 So then I smash up the palace like the son of Samson 
 Hollerin' louder than all of Bedlam 
 Take me to higher ground 
 Then bury my body six feet down 
 And I walked 40 miles out into that desert now 
 Wailed and moaned 
 'Til the lion, he called my name, yeah 
 And he said, "That old ship of Zion 
 Is takin' way, way out 
 Out into outer space," yeah yeah 
 And he said, "Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right," oh yeah 
 Here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Oh yeah 
 I climbed the highest of the heights 
 Atop that mountain, I watched the day turn into night 
 Oh, I tell you I was a wretched sight 
 But I stood long and hard until the light 
 Rubbing needles in my eyes 
 Eating dirt 
 I stood up 
 And everything was all right 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right, yeah 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Here we go! 
 But then I smash on the palace like the son of Samson 
 Hollerin' louder than all of Bedlam 
 Take me to higher ground 
 Then bury my body six feet downHow's that hardcore fanzine? Still take the piss? 
 Y&T got records, demos on cassette 
 Summer of the seven inch, too cool for school 
 Manifestoes at Kinko's, pinko commies play no fools 
 I feel the spirit moving over me 
 There are clouds beneath my feet 
 When vegans attack on ten speed bikes 
 Tattoos with meaning, American Spirit Lights 
 It's hard to smoke 'em when you got to be runnin' 
 Congressional and D.C.P.D 
 Lafayette Park undercover, the saddest sight I ever see, ever see 
 Tear gas electric! You know I can't quit this riot 
 Strictly professional insurrectionist kid and I can't deny it 
 I feel the spirit moving over me 
 There are clouds beneath my feet 
 When vegans attack on ten speed bikes 
 Tattoos with meaning, American Spirit Lights 
 Freshmen in fatigues, you know he's fighting for his right 
 Copious note taker, American Spirit Lights

 Copious note taker, American Spirit Lights(Unreleased track from the Elephant Riders sessions) 
 Off the shore of Laborador 
 The crew labored to bilge the hold 
 The stern it floundered in the shoal 
 The bow bucked up like a bronco 
 The crew was strong till Captain called 
 "Throw the spermaceti o'er 
 Throw the spermaceti overboard, overboard" 
 The captain woke with sandy eyes 
 "Am I alone?" the old sir cried 
 "'Tis I" he heard a bitter voice reply 
 "Jason Kip of ?town 
 I fear the men have all been drowned 
 And we two are the only to survive, to survive" 
 Nancy was a pretty girl 
 Golden hair and eyes of pearl 
 And she made a pretty bride 
 For the ancient Captain Bly 
 Her true love was Jason Kip 
 Porter on the Captain's ship 
 Nancy paced the widow's walk 
 Listening to the widow's talk 
 She heard "Nancy, do not weep, 
 The ship is late, but just a week" 
 "My late husband Captain Pierce 
 Was gone once for several years. 
 He returned with silk and spice 
 Minus one leg and his eyes" 
 In the end the ocean has its revenge 
 Whether tomorrow or 100 years 
 The Captain was a giant man 
 With miles of intestines 
 And a stomach larger than 
 The Persian Gulf 
 Was not 3 weeks when Bly took chase 
 And in his sleep untied him 
 And without a thought he ate him 
 Clean and whole, clean and whole 
 As the Captain licked his lips 
 He was spotted by a ship 
 Nancy truly was relieved 
 But for Jason how she grieved 
 In a carriage they rode home 
 Any guilt he did not show 
 As they sat to dine that night 
 He lacked any appetite 
 As the two lay in their bed 
 Captain's gut turned cherry red 
 With the sounds of gale-force wind 
 Sprung an angry Jason Kip 
 In the end the ocean has its revenge 
 Whether tomorrow or 100 years 
 It takes limbs and lives 
 And from the wives an equal ocean of their fallen tearsWhat's this about limits? 
 Sorry, I don't know none. 
 What's this about some DB limit? 
 Sorry, I can't hear none. 
 You can take a little cruise down the river of booze, 
 Act all poor and defeated. 
 Shout to the mountain some boo-hoo blues, 
 But I'll stand here and repeat it 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody hear me now. 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody get the message? 
 If you're gonna do it, do it live on stage 
 Or don't do it at all. 
 If you're gonna do it, you better take it to the stage, 
 Or don't do it at all. 
 I will suffer no evil. 
 My guitar will guide me through. 
 I will suffer no evil, 
 And this time, I want to hear it from you. 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody hear me now. 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody get the message? 
 Break it down, 
 To brass tacks. 
 Break it down, 
 To just the facts. 
 I don't need your sticky laminate, 
 I don't need your VIP. 
 I don't need your validation, 
 'Cause I wear mine on my sleeve. 
 So don't look to me for answers, 
 'Cause I don't got-a-one. 
 I just came to have a good time. 
 And I'm gonna have one. 
 Yes, I've lost many battles, 
 And even more days. 
 But if I had to do it over, 
 I'd do it just the same. 
 'Cause I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody hear me now. 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody get the message? 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Understand? 
 I'm an earth rocker! 
 Everybody get the message?Norman the Mormon hears the doorbell ring. 
 But inside they're not answering. 
 Peering through the window, to his surprise, 
 The door flies open, "Come inside!" 
 "I am Jason the Freemason, what you're selling I do not need. 
 Mr. Patrick, orthodox Catholic, is more likely in your league." 
 At that very moment Mr. Softee rings his bells, 
 Ding-a-ling ding-a-ling. 
 Quickly thereafter, Choco-Taco delight 
 While reclining on his brand new mountain bike. 
 Now watch you most closely, for here the plot does twist. 
 Enter Simon, the super Scientologist. 
 "I'm opining sailing Simon. Is you stupid or is you just high? 
 Mother Hubbard got me covered like Sarah Lee on her cherry pie." 
 Norman says to Simon, "Hey, if there are really aliens, 
 I would think that L. Ron Hubbard would have to be one of them." 
 "Oh My Lord! Oh My Lord! Oh My Oh My!" 
 Harmonica solo 
 The Pie Man passes by on his way to the fair (and he says) 
 "Reason, won't you put your blue dress on? 
 Reason, won't you put your blue jeans on?" 
 At that very moment Mr.Softee rings his bells. 
 So before Simon could bring his crushing blow, 
 Norman raises his hands, "Oh no, oh no!" 
 Simon says, "Hey, we ain't even finished this!" 
 Norman says, "Yes we have. Here come them Witnesses." 
 "Reason, won't you put your blue dress on? 
 Reason, won't you put your blue dress on?"I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old. 
 And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century. 
 I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words, 
 "Take a look what the cat dragged in; a red woodpecker and two of my kin." 
 Back in 1980, we played the AD&D. 
 That game was harder than the Elfstones of Shanara. 
 My character was baffling, a druid, wizard, halfling. 
 On top of that he was master of psionic powers. 
 Bring on the hordes, we have the sword 
 That smote the Goblin of Gygaxnor. 
 Pray that the sisters name us as victors 
 Of the twenty sided die. 
 I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old. 
 And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century. 
 I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words, 
 "Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin." 
 Long ago in Middle Earth 
 A man could measure all his worth 
 By his blade and by his staff, 
 And by the runes on his epitaph. 
 Go mount your horse and ride up north 
 To seek the Baron of the Frozen Berg. 
 Ask for assistance in the resistance 
 Of the twenty sided die. 
 I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old. 
 And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century. 
 I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words, 
 "Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin." 
 Saw Mazes and Monsters, Tom Hanks completely bonkers. 
 He spoke what he doth speaketh in Elizabethan. 
 Sad lad, he really couldn't handle starting from scratch on the very first level 
 But he died the death of a warrior. 
 A legend grows yearly by way of a local song. 
 The bishop and castle move in defense of pawns. 
 I'm rolling, I'm tumbling a twenty sided die. 
 A legend grows yearly by way of local song. 
 I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old. 
 And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century. 
 I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words, 
 "Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin."Oh, I see that lantern 
 Trimmed low burning in our home 
 And though I feel like crying 
 I swear tonight, I'll cry no more 
 And how many times have I prayed 
 That I would get lost along the way? 
 Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head

 Come with me and walk the longest mile 
 Is his wallet leather? Is his wallet fat? 
 For not a year later it's got you lying on your back 
 You should have closed your windows and got another dog 
 You should have chained up all the doors and switched up all the locks 
 And how many times have I prayed? 
 The angels would speed me away 
 Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head 
 The regulator's swinging pendulum

 We got big news 
 The party boat is here 
 The band is kicking 
 And I see lots of beers 
 And I believe there is gambling 
 On the deck just below from here 
 We got Greedo 
 Solo to the rear 
 They know the deal 
 Sacks packed and stacked with 
 Pieces of eight 
 A sailor's life for me 
 Live free or die 
 Never look a bounty hunter in the eye 
 Damn 
 Now where were we? 
 I think aces high 
 Sleeves are rolled 
 Tremendous diamonds 
 And a mouth of gold 
 I spent many years a rambling 
 I'll never change these foolish ways 
 'Cause fortune tellers make a killing nowadays 
 Best keep living like a castaway 
 With my sack packed 
 Pieces of eight 
 A sailor's life for me 
 Live free or die 
 Never look a merman in the eye

 Get a little closer to this sick affliction 
 Truth and consequences led to this conviction 
 Trial by error, another crucifixion 
 Eat it up

 And she is your only friend

 Shooting out fire at us heathen hordes

 Jump into the water 
 Keel-hauled on the constallations 
 Don't sell my belongings 
 Cause you know that I'll be back 
 Remember when I told you that I was a samurai? 
 Well the fact of the matter is that was a lie 
 There were some other things that I'd rather not recall 
 Y'all can blame it all ont he alcohol 
 But you ain't got no business criticizing me

 Since I first sat down 
 So I spoke to my conscious and asked what should I do 
 Yes, I spoke to my conscious and asked what should I do 
 My conscious said, "Shorty 
 I would plead guilty if I were you." 
 So I stood up on my feet and raised up my right hand

 I said, "Judge I'm confessing. 
 I shot my woman's man." 
 So the prosecutor asked me 
 "Shorty, why did you kill that man?"

 I said, "If you've never been in love 
 Then you wouldn't understand."

 Atop the mountain, under cities 
 We are monsters, we are older than men 
 Yes, we are Gorgons and we will have our revenge 
 Frighten their children by speaking our name 
 Epoch and eon, it's always the same 
 We are monsters but we will no longer run 
 We are the Cyclops and our time has come 
 This world was ours before it had ever known men 
 Soon it will be ours again 
 Grant them their tales of their forefather's glory 
 For soon it will be ours again 
 Atop the buttress the gargoyle sits 
 The fragile foundation crumbles to bits 
 We are monsters and they are but men 
 Behold the Colossus rises again!

 That they were too liberal and skillful with all the incisions 
 Cool heads prevailed and now it's all too clear to me

 So tell me, when you took a practice scholastic aptitude test, 
 Did you know the answers or did you guess? 
 You rely on gimmicks to amuse your fans, 
 And act all over bad to jack up your sound scan. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 How come you rhyme monosyllabically? 
 Has atrophy stricken your entire vocabulary? 
 Your style's like a garbage can, 
 It's meant to be taken out on a weekly basis. 
 Ever since you first reckoned you been in a state of suspended animation. 
 You invoke Snuffleupagus and australopithecus, 
 Me cray, you abacus. 
 But enough about you lets talk about me, 
 And how single-handedly I redefined the entire science of radio astronomy, 
 Even nobel prize winners questioned my notions of reality. 
 Oh, but I digress, 
 You play sorry, I play chess.

 They'll Listen but they can't hear you. 
 Haha haha! 
 Now look here, 
 Both you and I know the past ten years have been rather intense, 
 And I'm ashamed to admit that I have been fooled by the seductions of violence, 
 People walking around with ugly auras, 
 Sometimes I'm even tempted to see the advice of Dr. Laura... 
 But I ignore her... 
 And I take a deep breath and count to ten, 
 Ain't gonna let it get under my skin, 
 Take a deep breath and count to ten, 
 Think of all the nice places that I've been. 
 Like back when I was waging peace against the Visigoths, 
 I was tutored in the ancient mystories by a wizened philosoph. 
 Learned the polyrhythm of celestial time, 
 And wait for the one to come and get it done and finish the rhyme. 
 Haha!

 And lifts her veil 
 With a voice like running water 
 She tells them her tale

 Standing in the presence of Our Lady of Electric Light 
 Tiny plastic sabers 
 Piled high to my knees 
 Though the war rages on 
 I still find no enemies 
 They draw back the curtain 
 Are blinded by the dawn 
 And the shining Rock-Ola 
 Spins on and on

 And I run into the arms of Our Lady of Electric Light

 Violation of contract beyond a shadow of a doubt 
 Wherever he go, whomever he meet 
 He got to cross my house on the other side of the street 
 And you know that's the truth 
 Now here's the part that the devil sings while he's 
 hanging his head in a hard rain: 
 Where I'm headed, I don't know 
 Down this path, we all go 
 Grace and luck, blood from stone 
 Got nowhere to call my home 
 What comes around goes around 
 Three-fold or more 
 Now you can't get off of that killing floor 
 I'm going back to Tennessee 
 Back where I come from 
 Gonna head back to Beale Street 
 Beale Street and Oblivion, Oblivion 
 The devil & me, bad blood and beef 
 An undisciplined child, a liar and a thief 
 It's a low down shame, we were the best of friends 
 But I suppose all good things got to come to an end 
 What comes around goes around 
 Three-fold or more 
 Now you can't get off of that killing floor 
 I'm going back to Tennessee 
 Back where I come from 
 Gonna head back to Beale Street 
 Beale Street and Oblivion

 Of this great and blessed society 
 I've come to understand the wrongful nature 
 Of gun ownership in the age of monarchy 
 But sometimes it's just so hard 
 To act like the person you were born to be 
 Felonious behavior 
 Countless misdemeanors 
 Impersonating an officer of the law 
 Oh no 
 Bonafide man of action! 
 How you like that? 
 Bonafide man of action!

 You can't stop, you can't stop progress 
 You can't stop, you can't stop, no, no, no 
 You can't stop, you can't stop progress 
 You can't stop, you can't stop, no, no, no 
 I understand there's no victimless crimes 
 That being said I feel rather victimized 
 And I will seek substantial compensation 
 Whether legally, legal-ish, or otherwise 
 But sometimes it's such a hassle 
 To sit patiently outside the open gates of a loaded castle 
 Felonious behavior 
 Countless misdemeanors 
 Impersonating an officer of the law 
 Oh no 
 Bonafide man of action! 
 How you like that? 
 Bonafide man of action!

 Didn't jive with the local traditions 
 How was I to know she had a jealous husband? 
 He was the GM of a Tractor Supply 
 Well acquainted with the guns and knives 
 Sometimes I swear I have less sense than a bag of hammers 
 I prayed for courage, I prayed for love 
 I prayed for guidance from the heavens above 
 I prayed to know divine protections 
 But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas 
 He-eh-hey 
 Please forgive me, Mr. Gibbons 
 I crawled my way into The Doom Saloon 
 In an attempt to cauterize my wounds 
 I did a terrible job and they became powerfully infected 
 I found myself atop a stolen roan 
 Quite convinced that I would never see home 
 And all on account of my lack of common manners 
 I prayed for courage, I prayed for love 
 I prayed for guidance from the heavens above 
 I prayed to know divine protections 
 But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas 
 The saloon doors stopped swinging 
 The piano player stopped playing 
 In the shadows I could hear Archaic Spanish phrases 
 The preacher stood up from his table 
 In his right hand he held a bible 
 And in his left, the business end Of a Winchester rifle 
 I prayed for courage, I prayed for love 
 I prayed for guidance from the heavens above 
 I prayed to know divine protections 
 But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas

 David rose to beat the Philistines with five smooth stones and a sling. 
 One October morning his army did approach 
 The armory that sat between the Potomac and Shenandoah. 
 The engine house flung open with report of several guns

 On our way to Washington where work is done by men with gavels, 
 I heard a sound that just about removed me from my filly's saddle. 
 Just outside of Antietam, where once there was a mighty battle, 
 I heard the rhythm of the hammers beating the rail lines together. 
 Elephant Riders to the northwest bring news from father. 
 Don't be eating all the hard tack. 
 Between we two there's half a small sack. 
 Still, we got miles to.

 And I could see no good reason why the old man woulda lied. 
 Oh, he looked to be about as strong as a fish. 
 And I tell it as I wonder what's the poor man's only dying wish. 
 The winter of ought five, 
 Left with two score and five lives, 
 For the red eyed coal dogs howl, 
 Could be heard for miles around, 
 In the book of Genesis, 
 God grants man dominion, 
 Over animals, and the black dogs, 
 Of P. Pont caught a glimpse. 
 Come springtime there was food, 
 But the widows all refused. 
 And the poor man's black dogs came 
 To escort those who remained. 
 Brothers, Sisters, 
 Go across the river, 
 Don't look back once there, 
 Trust in God and take care, 
 The winter of our fall, 
 Left with two score and five lives, 
 For the red eyed coal dogs howl, 
 Could be heard for miles aroundWell I crashed a Cadillac through the Gates Of Hell 
 And returned with a Fist Full Of Dollars

 And you know I hang like a hex on a barn 
 Grind the guardrail like a nail on a file 
 Above and beyond the hole nine yards

 And smoked him higher than the highest of the minarets 
 Jesse James couldn't even handle it

 I made a ruckus with a succubus 
 Before she knew I was amphibious 
 She threw her hands up and started to scream 
 "Man you look like your straight outta V."

 And so it was that I, a wayward throwback to the Mesozoic, was enslaved as a circus freak to entertain you drunken monkeys. But Fate still had her twisted sense of humor and she granted me safe passage to sunny Florida, where for over the past 300 years now I have been breeding with an unheard of efficiency. And soon my progeny will rise up and say "Hail Draco, king of the dragon men!" 
 I fashion my crown from Quetzlcoatl's quills 
 Build my palace in the jungles of Brazil 
 In the summertime come my children 
 "For I hail Draco, king of dragon men!"

 There is no safe way out of here 
 No passage below the dungeon 
 No mother ship will save you 
 So goes the rapture of Riddley Walker 
 Churchyard was empty, schoolyard was bare 
 Wind in the streets, wind in the air 
 Pockets of diamonds and nothing to buy 
 Scream out hello and get no reply 
 Victims of zombies convene in the park 
 While any man with dignity makes an easy mark 
 Heaven is a long ways away 
 Heaven is a long, long, long, long ways away 
 There is no safe way out of here 
 No passage below the dungeon

 It seems you just don't get it 
 Well I've been appointed to inform you 
 Your days are numbered 
 You would cry, you would scream 
 If you knew half the things I see 
 Please, please just do as I say 
 Repent and leave your evil ways 
 Meanwhile, planes drop from the sky 
 People disappear and bullets fly 
 Little grey men are coming our way 
 Tastes just like chicken, they say 
 Actually they're all around 
 Secret bunkers underground

 Couldn't give a damn about JFK 
 Everything's conspiracy 
 Wouldn't be surprised if they have their way 
 Tastes just like chicken, they say 
 I know it's hard to swallow 
 It must sound too far fetched 
 But you can bet your bottom dollar 
 I ain't going with the restEvery time I set to write 
 Lyricals on the women 
 I always seem to end up 
 The victim of some terrible ass kicking 
 So now I'm telling myself 
 Friend why you got the obsession? 
 Here it is now people 
 To the best of my recollection 
 It goes against my Catholic upbringing 
 I admit it I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 Sucker for The Witch 
 I can tell you precisely 
 Where this all began 
 Salem, Massachusetts 
 And I was hardly a man 
 I fell madly in love with 
 Some brand of Stevie Nicks 
 Oh, I begged and I pleaded 
 Like a fiend for a fix 
 I must unburden my guilty conscience 
 I admit it I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 May God have mercy on my wicked soul 
 I can't help myself I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 I might deny her but my heart will never resist 
 I can't help myself I'm a sucker 
 She's made her appearances 
 In many the rhyme 
 And that's my cross to bear 
 Until the end of time 
 Better call The Inquisition 
 Better put me to the test 
 Give me exorcism 
 For I am truly possessed 
 It goes against my Catholic upbringing 
 I admit it I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 Sucker for The Witch 
 I must unburden my guilty conscience 
 I admit it I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 May God have mercy on my wicked soul 
 I can't help myself I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 I might deny her but my heart will never resist 
 I can't help myself I'm a sucker 
 For The Witch 
 It goes against my Catholic upbringing 
 I admit it I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 Sucker for The Witch 
 May God have mercy on my wicked soul 
 I can't help myself I'm a sucker for The Witch 
 I might deny her but my heart will never resist 
 I can't help myself I'm a suckerWake up...

 And then they tell ya 
 Find another home 
 And then you take a good look around 
 And they stole your rock and roll 
 And once it's gone you'll never get it back

 Bought myself a copy of Time, 
 And on the cover was a woman that I knew 
 When I was excavating in the mountains of Peru. 
 I caught a plane to L.I.A. 
 I didn't know what I would say. 
 Maybe she would like me, I had lost a lot of weight 
 Since she had last seen me in 1988. 
 Went to a local bar and ordered a cerveza, 
 Asked a man about the woman on the cover, 
 Dijo, "Claro que si, es el presidente's daughter." 
 Asked him where she might me, 
 "You did not hear this from me. 
 The girl is a terrorista 
 En las montanas a Chuquibambilla." 
 Took a bus through mountains. 
 Oh, my head was pounding. 
 Got to stay strong and carry on. 
 Got to stay strong, it won't be long. 
 Arrived in the villa surrounded by guerrillas. 
 Then my girl took me in her arms. 
 She said, "How have you been? 
 Oh, but I'll see you again." 
 I woke up in a coffin underneath 
 An altar to the east of Machu Pichu. 
 Crawled from the royal tomb. 
 The sun was bright, it burned my eyes. 
 I knew that she was gone 
 So I went down to the riverside 
 And I cried. 
 I went down to the riverside 
 I went down and I cried. 
 Muchas veces, I don't know if I'm coming or I'm going. 
 Muchas veces, I'm at a loss as what to do. 
 Muchas veces, I don't know if I'm coming or I'm going. 
 Muches veces, I'm at a loss as what to do. 
 My friend said, "She's nothing but pain." 
 I said, "I still love her the same. 
 All she needs is a little bit of love and 
 I'm sure I can make her change some." 
 "What about that girl in Zaire 
 That you met while a volunteer? 
 She got quite the education and 
 Quite the pair of legs on her." 
 "Oh, she married an Englishman, 
 A correspondent for CNN. 
 She thought he was rather handsome 
 In a UN blue flak jacket. 
 Oh, I see where your coming from, 
 But for me there is no other one. 
 I must be on my merry way." 
 Went to the five and dime, 
 Bought myself a copy of Time, 
 And on the cover was a woman that I knew 
 Claiming she was a kahuna down on Oahu. 
 Caught a plane to H.I.A. 
 The sun was bright, it burned my eyes. 
 I knew that she was near because I felt 
 Shivers on my spine. 
 I felt fine.Sick though it may seem It has always been a dream 
 Of mine to watch you drop 
 Like one million freezing flies

 Always sums to zero

 So the fruits of your labours 
 Have fermented into wine 
 And the sweat that you dripped 
 Is now the honey of the hive

 And I a blooming flower

 The passion, the power 
 Burn, burn 
 And you, your kindling, innocent 
 The fruits of your labours

 And the sweat that you dripped

 Within the ruins against the firth 
 The salamander has given birth 
 Only red horse rainbows can save us 
 Let them run wild and asunder 
 Call the royal guard to let the people in 
 Flaming arrows by hundreds 
 Pull the bog man from the peat, stand him up on both his feet 
 He jigs and reels, he jigs and reels 
 Infiltrating silver crabs, carry a most scented flag, to their front lines, to their front lines 
 Within the ruins 
 Against the firth 
 The salamander has given birth 
 Only red horse rainbows can save us 
 Let them run wild and asunder 
 Call the royal guard to let the people in 
 Flaming arrows by hundreds 
 And now the salamander 
 Run to the tower and call up the magus 
 If he has caused this, we'll tear out his pages 
 Throw 'I'm in shackles 
 And remove his handsBehold the man, a living example 
 In his likeness sacred profane 
 Behold the man, what I have done? 
 The path to hell is paved 
 With least resistance 
 But those less traveled by 
 Shall make a world of difference

 Extracting from my skull 
 All those things I've learned to live with 
 All those things I've loved 
 All these things are killing me 
 A perpetual fall from grace 
 But the hand that feeds 
 Is the hand that beats me 
 Fiercely in the face 
 So I will build myself an effigy 
 No longer mope in mediocre hell 
 Behold the man, a living example 
 Behold the man, what have I done? 
 Behold the man in his likeness 
 Sacred profane 
 Behold the man, a living example 
 Behold the man, what have I done? 
 Behold the man in his likeness 
 What have I done? 
 Effigy 
 Effigy 
 Effigy 
 Effigy 
 Behold the man 
 Behold the man 
 The icons, betrayal, and guilt 
 The icons, betrayal, and guilt 
 The icons, betrayal, and filth 
 The icon, what have I done?If I can't win, 
 Then I will multiply. 
 You cannot oppose 
 What you can't recognize. 
 Drop down, drop down, 
 All the angels sing. 
 Drop down to all fours 
 Like an ape, like a child, like dog, like a king. 
 Like a king. 
 I'm a walking definition 
 Of a defense mechanism. 
 I have no wants, I only know needs, 
 And what I need now is a new anatomy. 
 And they are like the insect; 
 So simple, yet so hard to appease. 
 And they are like the virus, 
 So simple, yet so hard to appease. 
 And I am your equal 
 And opposite reaction, 
 So feel this second skin. 
 And they are like the insect, 
 And they are like the insect, 
 So feel this second skin, 
 So feel this second skin. 
 Like an ape, like a child, like a king, like a dog, 
 Like an ape, like a child, like a king, like a dog, 
 Like a child, like an ape, like a king. 
 If I can't win, 
 If I can't win, 
 If I can't win, 
 If I can't win, 
 If I can't win,

 This is evolution's finest hour. 
 One step back would be on the forward, 
 And into the wayward out. 
 And you, you should be smiling,

 When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home 
 But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore 
 I get satisfaction everywhere I go

 You told everybody in the neighborhood 
 What a dirty mistreater, that I was no good 
 But someday, baby, you ain't a-worry my life anymore

 Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah, on every road 
 But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore 
 Invocation of the dummies, requiem for a head 
 Cash in at the corner, piles of street cred 
 I get satisfaction everywhere I go 
 One day baby, you'll worry me no more 
 Bang, bang, bang, bang! 
 Vámonos, vámonos 
 Bang, bang, bang!

 Bite the apple of my eye 
 This little piggy never made it home 
 Helter skelter, run for shelter 
 Can't escape the boiling swelter 
 Beat you like the dog that you are 
 Oh, I could kill you if I wanted 
 Kill you with my own two hands 
 Oh, I'm so happy I could kill you 
 Kill you like a sacrificial lamb 
 Because you, you are nothing but an animal 
 With a branding iron on your back 
 A sight so obscene, a sight so absurd 
 So many ways to skin a cat 
 All cut up 
 All cut up 
 Everything tastes better now 
 My hands, these tools, the fatted cow 
 The swine, the wine, the coming feast 
 Your Jesus Christ has canine teeth

 Montgomery Village kids, you just look like the type 
 You sure you want to know the mysteries? You're but a trifling height 
 Families in their den, staring at the box 
 Opossum minister, hen done killed the fox 
 Eyes like clouds know you stare 
 Count the minutes by the rocking of chairs

 There's a darkness deep in their eyes 
 As if the sun don't rise

 Fake farmers, straight jezebels, you know the score 
 Pick up the pieces in the graveyard and leave 'em at the door

 "Guild of Mute Assassins will convene at a quarter to nine." 
 Behind the court house atop a scaffold stands a man with a bag for a face, 
 "You will not have learned until I return to give my executioner the chase." 
 The swinging of its censers, the silence of its members 
 Oh, the Guild of Mute Assassins 
 From the places in-between that are so seldom seen 
 Oh, the Guild of Mute Assassins. 
 Widow in the furrow with thimbles hasn't seen her face in years 
 Kneels into a puddled reflection to find it is just as she's feared. 
 And in the Garden, the Archangel, sword above his head, 
 "You will not return until you have learned what you've forfeited." 
 The swinging of its censers, the silence of its members 
 Oh, the Guild of Mute Assassins 
 From the places in-between that are so seldom seen 
 Oh, the Guild of Mute Assassins. 
 Baby on a threshold with silver. Breath rises from its lips 
 Beam of yellow light from a doorway and the figure of a silhouette. 
 In the cradle a wood stiletto rattles like a barrow of bones.

 At the old icebox 
 I recommend you whistle 
 And give the box three knocks 
 Should you be so lucky 
 To hear whisperin' 
 It is an invitation 
 For you to leap in 
 May you go marching in three measure time 
 Dressed up as asses, drunk to the nines 
 Swing from the rafters, shouting those songs 
 Gone unsung for far too long 
 If boxing your shadow 
 At the wall full of moss 
 And antlers approach you 
 Then I am at a loss 
 May you go marching in three measure time 
 Dressed up as asses, drunk to the nines 
 Swing from the rafters, shouting those songs 
 Gone unsung for far too long 
 Drink to the dead all you still alive 
 We shall join them in good time 
 Should you go crossin' that silvery brook 
 It's best to leap before you look 
 Drink to the dead all you still alive 
 We shall join them in good time 
 Should you go crossin' that silvery brook 
 It's best to leap before you look 
 If surrounded by toadstools 
 At the old green glen 
 I'm afraid there is little 
 That I can recommend 
 Save all of your courage 
 And sincere prayer 
 And where you go-a treadin' 
 Take the utmost care 
 So let us drink to the dead all you still alive 
 We shall join them in good time 
 Should you go crossin' that silvery brook 
 It's best to leap before you look 
 Drink to the dead all you still alive 
 We shall join them in good time

 Been 'bout all I ever known 
 The junebugs rattle and roll 
 Around the old maypole 
 Thunder and lightning 
 I said the catfish are biting 
 I took a riverboat downstream 
 I think you know what I mean 
 The chicken hawks, they are gathering 
 Above my head, they are circling 
 Old friends coming out visiting 
 Say, "Hi," talk about collecting 
 Stray dogs won't come near me 
 Was blind, now I see clearly 
 Believe I'm fixing to die 
 When you're living in the country it's "why, oh why?"

 Whoa, I'm sorry that I left my home

 On the farther shore 
 On the farther shore 
 Look over yonder there 
 I see a ship of gold 
 I see a ship of gold 
 Beyond that mountain there 
 I see a Citty-on-the-Hille 
 Its gates are open wide 
 I hear the ringing bells 
 Look over yonder there 
 On toward the burying ground

 Poor boy is dead and gone 
 Whoa, Poor boy is dead and gone

 Will carry me to my reward 
 Out of this world it will take me

 Check into a motel and consult my horoscope 
 Sitting on the bed with the briefcase in my hands 
 Patiently awaiting any word from high command 
 Telekinetic dynamite! Psychic warfare is real! 
 You better believe me, brother, x-ray vision! 
 Telekinetic prophetic dynamite! Psychic warfare is real! 
 I know what you're thinking sister, x-ray vision! 
 Next thing that I did was tap out Morse code 
 With a wooden nickel on the receiver of the phone 
 Before I could complete it, I was quickly overtaken 
 By the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan

 But that really doesn't bother me 'cause I get off on the danger

 In Greek legend the son of Zeus and Danae 
 He and his mother was set adrift in a chest, but rescued by the intervention of Zeus. 
 He was brought up by KING POLYDECTES, 
 Who, wishing to secure Danae, got rid of him by encouraging him 
 In the almost hopeless task of obtaining the head OF THE MEDUSA! 
 With the help of the gods he was successful, and with the head, 
 Which turned all that looked on it into stone, he rescued Andromeda 
 And later metamorphosed Polydectes and his guests to stone.In the raining park the chessmen play

 Why not stick around for a while? 
 But they said You Got The Wrong One Baby 
 The New Generation is pushing up some daisies 
 And by decree of Rapture Inc. 
 We're closing this here market permanently 
 Coming down like a ton of lead 
 More bang for your buck 
 More pangs for the dead 
 Coca-Cola and Armageddon 
 I like it, like it, yes I do 
 So they 
 Tried to teach the world to sing 
 In perfect harmony 
 But it was way off key 
 So here comes the big RC 
 The melting pot boils 
 The bible belt breaks 
 And young America begins to sing 
 Coca-Cola and Armageddon 
 We like it, like it, yes we do 
 Coca-Cola and Armageddon 
 It's The Real Thing now 
 Come and get itOutside of Needles 
 I nearly lost my mind 
 I pulled over on the shoulder 
 Yeah, and I was there some time 
 A young thing came walking 
 From out behind the trees 
 She gave me consolations 
 And this is what she said to me 
 "Firebirds! Energy weapons! 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I don't care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently" 
 Yeah, I said I can get with that 
 Oh, I like those things too 
 But I don't own a Firebird 
 Perhaps this Datsun will do 
 Outside of the valley 
 Yeah, we got to overheating 
 She took off her sunglasses 
 And said "I believe this bears repeating 
 Firebirds! Energy weapons! 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I don't care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently 
 Firebirds! Energy weapons! 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I don't care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently" 
 (Firebirds...) 
 Outside of Barstow 
 We got to living on the lam 
 Sometimes doing odd jobs 
 And sometimes living off the land 
 Yeah, things went sour 
 And the girl, she got to packing 
 When I asked her why 
 She said "There are two things you are lacking 
 Firebirds! Energy weapons! 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I don't care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently 
 Firebirds! Energy weapons! 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I don't care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently"

 Acting foolishly on American Bandstand

 You gotta shake 'em on down 
 Scaling up the heights of folly

 Send out the blackbird

 You Babel rabble-rousers in polyester trousers 
 Big bright cities 
 Ain't no doubt Vishnu missed you, then Kali kissed you 
 Better get busy, better get busy, better get busy

 Hold the whole world in our hand and greet the dawn with open arms 
 So make a contribution if you have been amused 
 But before we depart, my brothers and sisters, I have some heavy news 
 Oh, how it breaks my heart, this photograph 
 Several in the ministry practice a fuzzy math 
 And some of us wear the robes of righteous are a little more next of kin 
 To the Steelak, the wicked one, who makes a meal of our sins 
 Ain't no telling how much longer 
 But we will never be, will never be moved 
 Ain't no telling how much longer 
 But we will never be, will never be moved 
 Woe be the architect of our city, cruel lever, the hillock strangler 
 Bold pusher of the cold bone index 
 Through the knotted bowels of the old alleyways 
 Read the future a false haruspex 
 Recall how he coaxed us out of the green plains 
 All of us, dumb eyed at the sheer number, so long ago it does not matter 
 Woe be architect in his slumber, for the watcher never sleeps 
 And on that day, there will be rejoicing and dancing streets 
 Ain't no telling how much longer 
 But we will never be, will never be moved 
 Ain't no telling how much longer 
 But we will never be, will never be moved 
 Hey hey hey, get your evolution on 
 Hey hey hey hey hey, get your evolution on 
 Good St. Charles Darwin wrote his gospel down 
 So keep your eyes turned to the sky and your ears down to the ground 
 Hey hey hey hey, get your evolution on

 What brought me here I do not know. 
 Sky is filled with starry scenes 
 Of heroes and their greatest deeds. 
 Satellites move across the sky, 
 And every year they multiply. 
 Father bear is sound asleep 
 And will be so for several weeks. 
 Across the plain I see a figure, 
 Every instant growing bigger. 
 Instinct tells me to run away 
 While faith proposes that I wave. 
 He approaches to a rod. 
 I whisper up a prayer to God. 
 The stranger asks me with a grin, 
 "Do you have the time my friend?" 
 Himalaya is my old time stomping ground 
 (Oh yes, time is of the essence). 
 Manitoba, better snows I've never found 
 (Oh yes, time is of the essence.) 
 The author looms above his page 
 And thinks it strange that at his age 
 He can not find the proper words 
 To describe his only world. 
 One would think that in a life 
 Where no two snowflakes are alike 
 One would have a brilliant rhyme 
 For each and every bit of time. 
 Himalaya is my old time stomping ground 
 (Oh yes, time is of the essence). 
 Manitoba, better snows I've never found 
 (Oh yes, time is of the essence.)Won't you come over and stay for a while. 
 Take a seat, have a drink, we'd have a nice time. 
 Turn on the TV I believe it's prime time. 
 I'll make you chicken cacciatore in five. 
 There's a woman down at 314 
 Who can't keep the stains on her kitchen floor clean. 
 And there's a man that's been knocking on his own door for three years, 
 Or has it been four? 
 I don't want to spend the winter in this house all alone. 
 Those neighbors of mine keep coming on over and playing with my mind. 
 I would like to love you. I sure would treat you right, 
 We could take the trash out every Thursday night. 
 Here in my neighborhood there is the strangest thing 
 Green buckets every Friday at every driveway. 
 They're filled with glasses, plastics and newspapers too. 
 They say they recycle and bring them back to you. 
 I would like to love you I should would treat you right, 
 We could take the trash out every Thursday night. 
 We could be a family, consume many goods. 
 We could be the pillars of the neighborhood. 
 Ah, babe, I'm a real hard worker. 
 With the proper tools I'll make you anything you yearn for. 
 The barbarians are at the gate, come in before it's too late. 
 I have food enough to last the two of us about a year. 
 One thousand cans of chowder and one thousand cans of beer. 
 I love my neighbors like I love my own brothers, 
 But every year they are getting odder and odder.Every last blind pulled when I walk down the street 
 The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat 
 Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child, yeah 
 Motherless child, yeah 
 This place once had a name 
 The people once had faces 
 In every town I find it's the same sad situation 
 Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man, yeah 
 Countryless man, yeah

 So I waited in the woods until they were gone 
 Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog, yeah

 Lose the kids, then our identities 
 But one thing I know for a fact 
 Moustache stays right where it's at

 Them yellow jackets keep the tired man from slacking 
 Stole my Camaro, primer gray

 How could you do this to a man so close to being cured? 
 We should get together and talk it over 
 At the Detroiter

 You front the money and I'll do all the talking

 Have surrounded my home 
 Got dogs and 'copters 
 And keep ringing my phone 
 Well I don't know if I'm coming or going 
 If it's them or me 
 Oh, but one things for certain 
 Willie Nelson only smokes killer weed 
 Now they're breaking my windows 
 Banging on my doors 
 Got me down and hog-tied 
 Rifling through my drawers 
 Boss demon tells me 
 Oh how he would like to kill me 
 Save your bullets tough guy 
 My disease does that for free 
 Well I don't know if I'm coming or going

 Stinking of smoke and ten cent gin 
 Now who will toast our noble host 
 Who has this morning given up the ghost? 
 The wooden coffer hand to hand 
 Kind words are offered, silent prayers 
 But she is satisfied the most 
 While stabbing madly at the roast 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The creditor rides with his men 
 The death of debtors he won't forgive 
 They repossess his silver eyes 
 Now in the potter's field he lies 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 Waiting for a dead man's shoes 
 Have you heard the latest news? 
 Lazarus is back from the dead 
 Looking as one would expect 
 Dripping with the waters of Sheol 
 Babbling about body and soul 
 And then he found his wife in their bed 
 Buck naked and already wed 
 The tax collector beneath his sheets 
 The door swings open, floorboards creak 
 Now who will toast our noble host 
 Who has this morning given up the ghost? 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The rib of Adam, the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain will receive, will receive, will receiveWoke up this morning, put on my Sunday shoes 
 Don't ask me why, it's just the nature of my grooves 
 I larged down the boulevard, came under attack 
 But I rocked them senseless, 'cause honey it's tight like that, good God 
 I hung a left down to Lemans' Avenue 
 Stagger Lees everywhere, trying to bring me doom, oh no 
 And that Old Scratch, he tried to purchase this soul 
 That don't confront me, 'cause I'm never in the need of a payroll 
 Heck, yeah 
 Amen, do it all again

 Honey, it's tight like that 
 Hey Honey, it's tight like that 
 And all you know-it-alls with politic views 
 Ideals don't situate themselves in His groove 
 So if you want to know, you just got to ask 
 But if you don't lose that skin, you'll never be tight like that 
 Watch me work now 
 Amen, do it all again 
 Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
 Spit shine and a three piece suit 
 Good Lord, I got to thank you 'cause you do it like you do

 Hey Honey, it's tight like that 
 Don't try to sell me your New Age guru troubles 
 'Cause I'm already reeling doing that good time gospel shuffle 
 And all your thumpings about your Armageddon 
 Ain't no big deal, 'cause I already hang with Him 
 Oh yeah, tight like that

 Honey, it's tight like that 
 Honey, it's tight like that

 I heard a fiddle and a mandolin, 
 Keeping rhythm on an old washboard 
 And stomping on the floor. 
 Saw people of all sorts 
 Dancing 'round in twos and fours, 
 Caroling about days of old, 
 And what the future holds. 
 In the middle was a big cauldron 
 That they were stirring, stirring, 
 And there were trees around 
 That they kept burning, burning. 
 I asked a toothless man 
 Who all these people were, and 
 He said, "The soapmakers, 
 And we are working, working." 
 As they stirred Heaven and Earth, they combined to one, 
 And everything was everyone and each one was all. 
 As they stirred I heard a trumpet call, 
 And everything was everyone and each one was all. 
 As they stirred Heaven and Earth, they combined to one, 
 And everything was everyone and each one was all. 
 As they stirred I heard a trumpet call,

 And would you not consider it unnatural to be born outside the womb?

 Knelt at the crossroads, knelt at the leather bound pew 
 Felt the pain of labor, and of sons overdue 
 In full submission we are reborn 
 We are the ploughshare, and yet we are the sword 
 We'll thresh the psyche and till the pride 
 Distill the blood, proclaim the gun divine 
 Damn the foul ego, praise the promised swarm 
 We are the ploughshare, and yet we are the sword 
 So we're lock, stock, and barrel 
 Hook, line, and sinker 
 Your freedom was your master 
 And your liberties the flint for

 You gave birth to the baby, but put a gun into its hands
