And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you 
 That Im tired of Castles in the Air 
 Ive got a dream I want the world to share 
 And castle walls just lead me to despair 
 Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky 
 A dream come true Ill live there till I die 
 Im asking you to say my last goodbye 
 The love we knew aint worth another try 
 Save me from all the trouble and the pain 
 I know Im weak but I cant face that girl again 
 Tell her the reasons why I cant remain 
 Perhaps shell understand if you tell it to her plain 
 Oh but how can words express the feel of sunlight 
 In the morning in the hills away from city strife 
 I need a country woman for my wife 
 Im city born but I love the country life 
 For I will not be part of the CocktailGeneration 
 Partners Waltz devoid of all romance 
 The music plays and everyone must dance 
 Im bowing out I need a second chance 
 And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you 
 And castle walls just lead me to despairAnd if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you 
 That Im tired of castles in the air 
 Dream come true Ill live there till I die 
 Im asking you to say my last goodbye 
 But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning 
 In the hills away from city strife 
 For I will not be part of her cocktail generation 
 Partners waltz devoid of all romance 
 And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you 
 And castle walls just lead me to despairOut in the West Texas town of El Paso 
 I fell in love with a Mexican girl 
 Nighttime would find me in Rosas cantina 
 Music would play and Felina would whirl 
 Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina 
 Wicked and evil while casting a spell 
 My love was deep for this Mexican maiden 
 I was in love but in vain I could tell 
 One night a wild young cowboy came in 
 Wild as the West Texas wind 
 Dashing and daring 
 A drink he was sharing 
 With wicked Felina 
 The girl that I loved 
 So in anger I 
 Challenged his right for the love of this maiden 
 Down went his hand for the gun that he wore 
 My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat 
 The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor 
 Just for a moment I stood there in silence 
 Shocked by the FOUL EVIL deed I had done 
 Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there 
 I had but one chance and that was to run 
 Out through the back door of Rosas I ran 
 Out where the horses were tied 
 I caught a good one 
 It looked like it could run 
 Up on its back 
 And away I did ride 
 Just as fast as I 
 Could from the West Texas town of El Paso 
 Out to the badlands of New Mexico 
 Back in El Paso my life would be worthless 
 Everythings gone in life nothing is left 
 Its been so long since Ive seen the young maiden 
 My love is stronger than my fear of death 
 I saddled up and away I did go 
 Riding alone in the dark 
 Maybe tomorrow 
 A bullet may find me 
 Tonight nothings worse than this 
 Pain in my heart 
 And at last here I 
 Am on the hill overlooking El Paso 
 I can see Rosas cantina below 
 My love is strong and it pushes me onward 
 Down off the hill to Felina I go 
 Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys 
 Off to my left ride a dozen or more 
 Shouting and shooting I cant let them catch me 
 I have to make it to Rosas back door 
 Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
 A deep burning pain in my side 
 Though I am trying 
 To stay in the saddle 
 Im getting weary 
 Unable to ride 
 But my love for 
 Felina is strong and I rise where Ive fallen 
 Though I am weary I cant stop to rest 
 I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle 
 I feel the bullet go deep in my chest 
 From out of nowhere Felina has found me 
 Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side 
 Cradled by two loving arms that Ill die for 
 One little kiss and Felina goodbyeThere is no time to discuss or debate 
 What is right what is wrong for our people 
 Time has run out for all those who wait 
 With bent limbs and minds that are feeble 
 And the rain falls and blows through their window 
 And the snow falls and blows through their door 
 And the seasons revolve mid their sounds of starvation 
 When the tides rise they cover the floor 
 They come from the north and they come from the south 
 And they come from the hills and the valleys 
 And theyre migrants and farmers and miners and humans 
 Our census neglected to tally 
 And the snow falls and it blows through their door 
 And theyre African Mexican Caucasian Indian 
 Hungry and hopeless Americans 
 The orphans of wealth and of adequate health 
 Disowned by this nation they live in 
 And with weather worn hands on bread lines they stand 
 Yet but one more degradation 
 Yes and theyre treated like tramps while we sell them food stamps 
 This thriving and prosperous nation 
 And with roaches and rickets and rats in the thickets 
 Infested diseased and decaying 
 With rags and no shoes and skin sores that ooze 
 By the poisonous pools they are playing 
 In shacks of two rooms that are rotting wood tombs 
 With corpses breathing inside them 
 Oh yes and we pity their plight as they call in the night 
 And we do all that we can do to hide them 
 And the snow falls in white drifts that fold 
 And the tides rise with floods in the nursery 
 And a child is crying hes hungry and cold 
 His life has been sold his young face looks old 
 Its the face of America dyingIm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande 
 But my legs aint bowed and my cheeks aint tan 
 Im a cowboy who never saw a cow 
 Never roped a steer cause I dont know how 
 Sure aint a fixin to start in now 
 Yippie yi yo kayah 
 Im an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande 
 And I learned to ride ride ride fore I learned to stand 
 Im a riding fool who is up to date 
 I know every trail in the Lone Star State 
 Cause I ride the range in a Ford V8 
 Were old cowhands from the Rio Grande 
 And we come to town just to hear the band 
 We know all the songs that the cowboys know 
 Bbout the big corral where the doggies go 
 We learned them all on the radio 
 Im an old cowhand 
 Oh yes Mr Bing 
 Too hot for you Uncle Fudd 
 Down from the Rio Grande 
 Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland 
 Where the buffalo roam around the zoo 
 And the Injuns run up a rug or two 
 And the old Bar X is just a barbecue yeah 
 Im a pioneer who began from scratch 
 I dont bat an eye in a shootin match 
 They dont call me Elmer they call me Satch 
 Get along little horsy 
 Yippie yi yo kayah ohWhat will the world be like when youre on your own 
 What will the world be like when youre almost grown 
 What will the world be like when you pack your things 
 When you leave your home 
 What in the world will tomorrow bring 
 Will you be safe in the sweet arms of love 
 Will you be true to yourself and the things you believe 
 What will the world be like when you need a friend 
 What will the world be like when youre on the mend 
 What will the world be like when you go astray 
 And you slip and fall 
 How in the world will you find your way 
 Will you find peace and forgiveness and joy 
 Will you have children yourself and be worried like me 
 What will the world be like when youre on your own 
 What will the world be likeIf you could read my mind love 
 What a tale my thoughts could tell 
 Just like an old time movie 
 Bout a ghost from a wishing well 
 In a castle dark or a fortress strong 
 With chains upon my feet 
 You know that ghost is me 
 And I will never be set free 
 As long as Im a ghost that you cant see 
 If I could read your mind love 
 What a tale your thoughts could tell 
 Just like a paperback novel 
 The kind the drugstores sell 
 When you reached the part 
 Where the heartaches come 
 The hero would be me 
 But heroes often fail 
 And you wont read that book again 
 Because the endings just too hard to take 
 Id walk away like a movie star 
 Who gets burned in a three way script 
 Enter number two 
 A movie queen to play the scene 
 Of bringing all the good things out in me 
 But for now love lets be real 
 I never thought I could act this way 
 And Ive got to say that I just dont get it 
 I dont know where we went wrong 
 But the feelings gone 
 And I just cant get it back 
 If you could read my mind love 
 In a castle dark or a fortress strong 
 But stories always end 
 And if you read between the lines 
 Youll know that Im just tryin to understand 
 The feelins that you lack 
 I never thought I could feel this way 
 But the feelins gone 
 And I just cant get it backI am a man who traveled everywhere 
 Holding mirages made of hair 
 Mansions of silver women of gold 
 Well all I had was the tale I told 
 Ive been a wanderer I can let go 
 But you would do better to stay 
 Dont burn the bridge that brought you over 
 Or youll be traveling all your days 
 I had no family I had no real friends 
 I had a lover who more then just pretends 
 She played a mind game I played it too 
 When youre in love those are the things you do 
 Ive been a loser Ive won the game 
 Ive had power fortune and fame 
 For youre a poor man just the same 
 Poor man poor man 
 Yes Ill admit Ive burned my bridges one and all 
 That I have turned my back on some who tried to see me fall 
 And then you came and built a bridge 
 Where once there was a wall in my life 
 I can cross over live on the other side 
 I was a rover until I met my bride 
 She has the magic I have the dreams 
 With her my life is really all it seems 
 Theres no illusion this is for real 
 And Im so satisfied deep within 
 You are the bridge that brought me over 
 And you are everywhere Ive ever been 
 Your man Im your man 
 And then you came to build a bridge 
 Where once there was a wall 
 Came and built a bridge 
 Where there was a wall 
 In my life in my lifeI was walking by the graveyard late last Friday night 
 I heard somebody yelling it sounded like a fight 
 It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night 
 Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight 
 So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go 
 Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show 
 Where the police cannot find them where the wanted men can go 
 Theres freedom when your walking even though youre walking slow 
 Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can 
 That homeless brother is my friend 
 Its hard to be a pack rat its hard to be a bo 
 But livings so much harder where the heartless people go 
 Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know 
 That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo 
 And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill 
 And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill 
 And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill 
 And theyre sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill 
 Somewhere there was a woman somewhere there was a child 
 Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild 
 But some wheres just like nowhere when you leave it for a while 
 Youll find the brokenhearted when youre travelling junglestyle 
 Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men 
 Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again 
 Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage where madmen dont 
 Pretend 
 Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end 
 The ghosts of highway royalty have vanished in the night 
 The Whitman wanderer walking toward a glowing inner light 
 The children have grown older and the cops have gripped us tight 
 Theres no spot round the melting pot for free men in their flight 
 And you who leave on promises and prosper as you please 
 The victim of your riches often dies of your disease 
 He cant hear the factory whistle just the lonesome freight trains 
 Wheeze 
 Hes living on good fortune he aint dying on his knees 
 That homeless brother is my friendLove me tender love me sweet 
 Never let me go 
 You have made my life complete 
 And I love you so 
 Love me tender love me true 
 All my dreams fulfill 
 For my darling I love you 
 And I always will 
 Love me tender love me long 
 Take me to your heart 
 For its there that I belong 
 And well never part 
 Love me tender love me dear 
 Tell me you are mine 
 Ill be yours through all the years 
 Till the end of time 
 When at last my dreams come true 
 Darling this I know 
 Happiness will follow you 
 Everywhere you go 
 Yes my darling I love you 
 Love me tenderCome you masters of war 
 You that build all the guns 
 You that build the death planes 
 You that build all the bombs 
 You that hide behind walls 
 You that hide behind desks 
 I just want you to know 
 I can see through your masks 
 You that never done nothin 
 But build to destroy 
 You play with my world 
 Like its your little toy 
 You put a gun in my hand 
 And you hide from my eyes 
 And you turn and run farther 
 When the fast bullets fly 
 Like Judas of old 
 You lie and deceive 
 A world war can be won 
 You want me to believe 
 But I see through your eyes 
 And I see through your brain 
 Like I see through the water 
 That runs down my drain 
 You fasten all the triggers 
 For the others to fire 
 Then you set back and watch 
 When the death count gets higher 
 You hide in your mansion 
 As young peoples blood 
 Flows out of their bodies 
 And is buried in the mud 
 Youve thrown the worst fear 
 That can ever be hurled 
 Fear to bring children 
 Into the world 
 For threatening my baby 
 Unborn and unnamed 
 You aint worth the blood 
 That runs in your veins 
 How much do I know 
 To talk out of turn 
 You might say that Im young 
 You might say Im unlearned 
 But theres one thing I know 
 Though Im younger than you 
 That even Jesus would never 
 Forgive what you do 
 Let me ask you one question 
 Is your money that good 
 Will it buy you forgiveness 
 Do you think that it could 
 I think you will find 
 When your death takes its toll 
 All the money you made 
 Will never buy back your soul 
 And I hope that you die 
 And your deathll come soon 
 I will follow your casket 
 In the pale afternoon 
 And Ill watch while youre lowered 
 Down to your deathbed 
 And Ill stand over your grave 
 Til Im sure that youre deadYou make me 
 Think Im listenin to a symphony 
 You make me 
 Hear the beauty of your poetry 
 You got a good way with music baby 
 Got a good way with words 
 Got a good way with words 
 Hear the lyric in the harmony 
 Hear the chorus in the melody 
 I see your face 
 And when you walk my way 
 The violins 
 Always start to play 
 And when you talk 
 I dont care what you say 
 It comes out I love you so 
 Anyway you should know 
 Got a good way with wordsMaybe baby Ill have you 
 Maybe baby youll be true 
 Maybe baby Ill have you for me 
 Its funny honey you dont care 
 You never listen to my prayer 
 Maybe baby you will love me someday 
 Well you are the one that makes me glad 
 And you are the one that makes me sad 
 And when some day you want me 
 Well Ill be there wait and see 
 Maybe baby Ill have you 
 Maybe baby Ill have you for meAh it aint so easy is it You almost lost your place 
 And perhaps youre wondering how youre going to cope with your disgrace 
 Well your wealth is well established and your friends were never few 
 And all the things they told you of your finding to be true 
 Well if truth can free the guilty while the innocent must die 
 Then I respect respect respect the coldest lie 
 And you talk of human justice while you drive on fancy wheels 
 And you push them to their limit just to see how nice it feels 
 Well it doesnt really matter if shes living or shes dead 
 You just drive away forgetting that your bumpers dipped in red 
 Well if thats the kind of justice that our hall of justice claims 
 Then I respect respect respect old Jesse James 
 And most cordially they caught you and they asked you to obey 
 And they threw you into prison just in case you could not pay 
 Well King Arthur jousted Lancelot who stole away his wife 
 And your lawyers jousted with the court to save your precious life 
 Well if living is what matters though you lie with every breath 
 Then I respect respect the ones we put to death 
 And you won your case most easily and soon you will be free 
 But there will be a million more who lose their liberty 
 Not because of what they did but what they did not do 
 They did not pay a lawyer or a judge to see them through 
 Why they had no friends to call on and they could not raise their bail 
 Well if the winning is what matters I respect the ones who failIts just the sun thats shinin in your eyes 
 Its just the moon that is the suns disguise 
 Just the sky with clouds a blowin by 
 The sun and the moon and the sky and you and I 
 Its just the rain thats rollin down my cheek 
 Its just the wind that makes me hear you speak 
 Its just the song that anyone can sing 
 The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring 
 Its just the world that gonna break your heart 
 Its just the past thats tearin us apart 
 Its just the time we have so little of 
 The world and the past and the time that we fell in love 
 Its just the sun thats shinin in your eyes 
 Its just the moon that is the suns disguise 
 Its just the sky with clouds a blowin by 
 The sun and the moon and the sky and you and II find you in my arms this is how it begins 
 And we are so close like Siamese twins 
 Though youre separate from me and were often apart 
 Still nobody can see that were joined at the heart 
 Joined at the heart 
 You dont look like me its true and I dont look like you 
 As we lead separate lives our secret still survives 
 Only we know our special affection 
 Only we know our secret connection 
 Now youre back in my arms at the end of the day 
 And like Siamese twins with each other well stay 
 Still nobody can see that were joined at the heartAnd now the purple dusk of twilight time 
 Steals across the meadows of my heart 
 High up in the sky the little stars climb 
 Always reminding me that were apart 
 You wander down the lane and far away 
 Leaving me a song that will not die 
 Love is now the stardust of yesterday 
 The music of the years gone by 
 Sometimes I wonder how I spend 
 The lonely nights 
 Dreaming of a song 
 The melody 
 Haunts my reverie 
 And I am once again with you 
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration 
 But that was long ago 
 And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song 
 Besides the garden wall when stars are bright 
 You are in my arms 
 The nightingale 
 Tells his fairytale 
 Of paradise where roses grew 
 Though I dream in vain 
 In my heart it will remain 
 My stardust melody 
 The memory of loves refrainHave you seen me I just might be your little baby 
 Have you seen me Im lookin at you with grown up eyes 
 Every milk carton and highway billboard sign says maybe 
 Have you seen me or have you only seen my disguise 
 I had a fight with mama and she said she couldnt stand me 
 I had a fight with papa and he really likes to swing his fist 
 Im sick and tired of all those stupid rules they hand me 
 They try to make me feel I have no right to exist 
 Have you seen me well Ive seen you 
 Ive seen what the grown ups do 
 Ive seen I can do that too 
 Have you seen me 
 Well Im older now than I was the day I vanished 
 You might not even know me if you saw me passin by 
 Others take your place in the dark world of the banished 
 On vicious streets where no one hears me cry 
 Well you cant run you cant hide 
 Turn your face walk inside 
 Cant close your doors because Im yours 
 Well Im fighting in Nicaragua Im fighting in Afghanistan 
 In Israel I wear a gun in Palestine a rock is in my hand 
 In Africa you see me starve in America they just throw me away 
 But Im making history that other kids will read about some day 
 Have you seen meLove is funny or its sad 
 Or its quiet or its mad 
 Its a good thing or its bad 
 But beautiful 
 Beautiful to take a chance 
 And if you fall you fall 
 And Im thinking I wouldnt mind at all 
 Love is tearful or its gay 
 Its a problem or its play 
 Its a heartache either way 
 And Im thinking if you were mine 
 Id never let you go 
 And that would be but beautiful I knowBorn in the heat of the desert 
 My mother died giving me life 
 Deprived of the love of a father 
 Blamed for the loss of his wife 
 You know Lord Ive been in a prison 
 For something that I never done 
 Its been one hill after another 
 Ive climbed them all one by one 
 But this time Lord you gave me a mountain 
 A mountain you know I may never climb 
 It isnt just a hill any longer 
 You gave me a mountain this time 
 My woman got tired of heartaches 
 Tired of the grief and the strife 
 So tired of working for nothing 
 Just tired of being my wife 
 She took my one ray of sunshine 
 She took my pride and my joy 
 She took my reason for living 
 She took my small baby boy 
 You gave me a mountain this timeCotton candy two for a quarter 
 See if the fat man can guess your weight 
 A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her 
 And Im going home cause its late 
 Roller coasters make me dizzy 
 And cotton candy makes me sick 
 I wish I had some Bromo fizzy 
 Now that would do the trick 
 Everyone knows that the clowns arent happy 
 And everyone knows that the people dont care 
 I wish I could laugh at the way that theyre acting 
 But Im so sick I just dont dare to 
 High wire dancers kick and balance 
 White silk horses step in time 
 The tattooed man displays his talents 
 Im not the talented kind 
 I always go to the circus on Sunday 
 And there I can laugh at the people I see 
 But when I leave home in the morning on Monday 
 Everybody laughs at me 
 I make other people nervous 
 I guess thats why they laugh at me 
 But to me my life is a threering circus 
 And I can see it for free 
 Have you seen my wife Elvira 
 She can tame a lion you know 
 Well I once had a bushy mane 
 But that was so damn long ago 
 Tightcollared clowns in plastic buildings 
 Have happy families as their fate 
 Happy jobs and happy clubs 
 And happy people they hate 
 Everyones juggling and everyones acting 
 With smiles of grease paint three feet wide 
 Everyones caught on a carousel pony 
 And one time around is a lifetime rideWhen Im worried and I cant sleep 
 I count my blessings instead of sheep 
 And I fall asleep counting my blessings 
 When my bankroll is getting small 
 I think of when I had none at all 
 I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads 
 And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds 
 If youre worried and you cant sleep 
 Just count your blessings instead of sheep 
 And youll fall asleep counting your blessings 
 And youll fall asleep counting your blessingsThe spirit of Fatima still rules the earth 
 She knows your future she knows what its worth 
 Sister Fatima has godgiven powers 
 On 42nd street in a shop that sells flowers 
 Is her palace 
 Come and be healed 
 She knows all your business your health and your ills 
 Shell counsel your weddings divorces and wills 
 For full restoration five dollars an hour 
 With each consultation a free holy flower 
 If she likes you why you can have two 
 And I came from nowhere like you and your friend 
 My searching and wandering went on without end 
 My future was dim my spirit was crushed 
 In one sacred moment my questions were hushed 
 Im a servant of fate in this garden of truth 
 A humble recruit of the taffeta booth 
 Where all things are known but few are revealed 
 Where sins are forgotten and sickness is healed 
 For five dollars 
 The flower is freeThe pattern is broken the pieces dont fit 
 Pull them apart and move them a bit 
 See what youve made and see who you are 
 The plans that youve laid can go just so far 
 Before the pattern gets broken the pieces dont fit 
 Then its the end of sunny weather 
 When all the pieces fit together 
 And it looks like the final ending 
 But its really the beginning 
 And though the pieces are apart now 
 And you got a broken heart now 
 Someday the sun is gonna shine on a fabulous design 
 That only you can see Ah 
 But then the pattern gets broken the pieces dont fit 
 The patterns broken and the pieces dont fit 
 Pull them apart and then move them a bit 
 See what youve made and see who you are 
 The plans youve laid will only go just so far 
 Ah ahaha ah ahaha ah ahhhaWell thats all right mama

 Oh mama mama mama she done told me

 She said The woman that you been mesin with

 Well thats all right yes thats all right 
 Yeah well thats all right now mama 
 Piano 
 Yeah thats all right now mamaSouth of the border down Mexico way 
 Thats where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play 
 And now as I wander my thoughts ever stray 
 South of the border down Mexico way 
 She was a picture in old Spanish lace 
 Just for a tender while I kissed a smile upon her face 
 Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay 
 South of the border Mexico way 
 Then she sighed as she whispered manana 
 Never dreaming that we were parting 
 And I lied as a whispered manana 
 Cause our tomorrow never came 
 South of the border I jumped back one day 
 There in a veil of white by the candlelight she knelt to pray 
 The mission bells told me that I mustnt stay 
 The mission bells told me ding dong that I must not stay 
 Stay South of the border down Mexico wayI told Mary about us I told her about our great sin 
 Mary cried and forgave me and Mary took me back again 
 Said if I wanted my freedom I could be free evermore 
 But I dont wanna be and I dont wanna see Mary cry anymore 
 Oh devil woman devil woman let go of me 
 Devil woman let me be and leave me alone I wanna go home 
 Mary is waitin and weepin down in our shack by the sea 
 Even after Ive hurt her Marys still in love with me 
 Devil woman its over trapped no more by your charms 
 Cause I dont wanna stay I wanna get away woman let go of my arm 
 Devil woman youre evil like the dark coral reef 
 Like the winds that bring high tides you bring sorrow and grief 
 You made me ashamed to face Mary I barely had the strength to tell 
 Skiesre not so black Mary took me back Mary has broken your spell 
 Running along by the seashore running as fast as I can 
 Even the seagulls are happy glad Im coming home again 
 Never again will I ever cause another tear to fall 
 Down the beach I see what belongs to me the one I want most of all 
 Oh devil woman devil woman dont follow me 
 Devil woman let me be and leave me alone Im going back homeYou saw me crying in the chapel 
 The tears I shed were tears of joy 
 I know the meaning of contentment 
 Now I am happy with the lord 
 Just a plain and simple chapel 
 Where humble people go to pray 
 I pray the lord that Ill grow stronger 
 As I live from day to day 
 Ive searched and Ive searched 
 But I couldnt find 
 No way on earth 
 To gain peace of mind 
 Now Im happy in the chapel 
 Where people are of one accord 
 We gather in the chapel 
 Just to sing and praise the lord 
 Evry sinner looks for something 
 That will put his heart at ease 
 There is only one true answer 
 He must get down on his knees 
 Meet your neighbor in the chapel 
 Join with him in tears of joy 
 Youll know the meaning of contentment 
 Then youll be happy with the lord 
 Youll search and youll search 
 But youll never find 
 Take your troubles to the chapel 
 Get down on your knees and pray 
 Your burdens will be lighter 
 And youll surely find the wayIf you wanna make me happy here is all you gotta do 
 Take me where youre going and Ill take care of you 
 Cause I got this need thats growing to keep you satisfied 
 And if you keep your green light showing well you can take me for a ride 
 Cause I la la la la la la love you 
 And I la la la la la la care 
 And I really want you with me baby everywhere 
 Well I like the way youre moving and I like a the way you go 
 I like the way you let your locomotion show 
 Cause my drivin wheel is drivin and my pistons working good 
 And if your motor gives you some trouble baby Ill take a look underneath your hood yes I would 
 Well I know you like your transportation with a motor and a rubber wheel 
 But when you move you cause a transformation in this lover and the way I feel 
 So if you want to make me happy here is all you gotta do 
 Just let me ride your boxcar and Ill hobo with you 
 Cause all I got is on my shoulder Im walkin on my travlin shoes 
 And before I get much older Im gonna kick these lovesick blues 
 Yes I la la la la la la love you 
 Cause IChestnuts roasting on an open fire 
 Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
 Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
 And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
 Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
 Help to make the season bright 
 Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 They know that Santas on his way 
 Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mothers child is gonna spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 So Im offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from one to ninety two 
 Although its been said many times many ways 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
 Merry Christmas to youI could have loved her but she would change her mind 
 I couldnt leave her cause when her sweet face shined 
 I could believe in all her dreams and lies 
 But I could not leave those crazy eyes 
 Her clothes just suit her theres no one cuter 
 But watch your step cause shes a real straight shooter 
 Shes got a string of broken hearted guys 
 That just could not leave those crazy eyes 
 Now you hear about all those guys that hang around in bars 
 Weepin and moanin about the gal that got away 
 Moanin the blues to soft guitars 
 Wonderin what time the bars gonna close and 
 How much longer in their lives theyre gonna have to pay 
 Cause someone smacks you with a thousand highs 
 And just attracts you hardly even tries 
 Thats why I know I won the sweetest prize 
 When I found love in those crazy eyes 
 When someone smacks you with a thousand highs 
 When I found love in those crazy crazy eyesToday I passed you on the street 
 And my heart fell at your feet 
 I cant help it if Im still in love with you 
 Somebody else stood by your side 
 And she looked so satisfied 
 A picture from the past came slowly stealing 
 As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you 
 Then suddenly I got that old time feelin 
 Its hard to know anothers lips will kiss you 
 And hold you just the way I used to do 
 Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you 
 I cant help it if Im still in love with youIt was in the spring one sunny day 
 My sweetheart left me Lord she went away 
 And now shes gone and I dont worry 
 For Im sitting on top of the world 
 Mississippi river is deep and wide 
 My sweethearts living on the other side 
 Now shes gone and I dont worry 
 You dont like my peaches dont you shake my tree 
 Get out of my orchard let my peaches be 
 For Im sitting on top of the worldI cant answer the questions you ask me 
 I dont know what to say 
 The answers are somewhere lost in the stars 
 When the night has turned to day 
 But I know if the silence of night could be here 
 It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear 
 And I could reach out and draw you so near to me 
 Touch me and warm me and I will lie still 
 And all that you ask me to give you I will 
 One living moment well have for our own 
 A brief flash of time that we spent unalone 
 But you ask me for nothing and give what you can 
 And were wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again 
 And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one 
 Closely were falling through time 
 And the earth will turn in the silence of space 
 Always in motion yet always in place 
 And all things will change yet remain what they are 
 And far will be near and near will be far 
 And the ages will darken and blend into time 
 And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme 
 But our moment together is forever sublime 
 For the time has arrived when we must understand 
 That were lost in a void on this sad speck of sand 
 And nobody knows where we are no one cares 
 And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares 
 And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame 
 Have forgotten that no one remembers their name 
 But time and the universe are always the same 
 Closely were falling through timeThe story of my life is very plain to read 
 It starts the day you came 
 And ends the day you leave 
 The story of my life begins and ends with you 
 The names are still the same 
 And the storys still the truth 
 I was alone 
 You found me waiting and made me your own 
 I was afraid 
 That somehow I never could be a man that you wanted of me 
 Youre the story of my life and every word is true 
 Each chapter sings your name 
 Each page begins with you 
 Its the story of our times and never letting go 
 If I die today I wanted you to know 
 Stay with me here 
 Share with me care with me 
 Stay and be near 
 And when it began Id lie awake every night 
 Just knowing somewhere deep inside 
 That our affair just might write 
 The story of my life its very plain to read 
 It ends the day you leaveMust you dance every dance with the same fortunate man 
 You have danced with him since the music began 
 Wont you change partners and dance with me 
 Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face 
 Cant you see Im longing to be in his place 
 Ask him to sit this one out and while youre alone 
 Ill tell the waiter to tell him hes wanted on the telephone 
 Youve been locked in his arms ever since heavenknowswhen 
 Wont you change partners and then 
 Ill tell the waiter to tell him hes wanted on the telephone 
 Youve been locked in his arms ever since heaven knows when 
 You may never want to change partners again 
 You may never want to change partners againYour cheatin heart will make you weep 
 Youll cry and cry and try to sleep 
 But sleep wont come the whole night through 
 Your cheatin heart will tell on you 
 When tears come down like falling rain 
 Youll toss around and call my name 
 Youll walk the floor the way I do 
 Your cheatin heart will tell on youThe auctioneer said Im not through yet 
 Heres a horse the likes of which youve never seen 
 And the straw hats in the sun with a face beneath each one 
 Shown doubtful and the auctioneer got mean 
 Do you think that you can find a horse like this every day 
 I dont think theres any better on this earth 
 And the more you pay the more its worth 
 Then out she came a snowwhite mare 
 Prancin and a dancin in the silver sun 
 They watched her from behind as she did her bump and grind 
 Walkin naked sad and graceful for their fun 
 Oh how I wished I could afford that lady painted white 
 A queen with high nobility of birth 
 But the more you pay the more its worth 
 My pockets hung with empty blues 
 Silent heels were standin on my growin pains 
 My bid was not too bad two bits was all I had 
 And the stable boy just handed me the reins 
 Well the gallery went wild and the auctioneer half smiled 
 What we dont sell we shoot or give away 
 Cause the more you pay the more its worth 
 And where was the boy who rode on her back 
 With his arms holding tight round her neck 
 How tightly he clung 
 When they both were young 
 And fate had not let this poor girl be so 
 DisgracedBlack crows in the summer sky Wheat fields turned to gold 
 Workers in the blazing sun Forests in the cold 
 Farmers in a cabin room Portraits of your eyes 
 Look at me in painful gloom theyve seen so many lies 
 You who love the truth you who love the truth 
 You who love the truth have seen so many lies 
 Skeletons smoke cigarettes A blazing sun that never sets 
 A purple forest in the haze Hands that know of common ways 
 Some survive their shattered dreams but you are lost in colour schemes 
 Falling down between the seams youve seen so many lies 
 I wonder how youd feel today if you knew the millions that theyd paid 
 For canvas glowing with your heat shown in airconditioned suites 
 With glass and steel and carpet floors stored in crypts as cold as yours 
 Portraits of your bleeding eyes eyes that saw so many lies 
 You who love the truth you who love the truth you who love the truthTheres a danger zone not a stranger zone 
 Than the little plot I walk on that I call my home 
 Full of eerie sights weird and skeery sights 
 Evry vicious animal that creeps and crawls and bites 
 On the Amazon the prophylactics prowl On the Amazon the hypodermics howl On 
 The Amazon youll hear a scarab scowl and sting zodiacs on the wing 
 All the stalactites and vicious vertebrae 
 Hunt the stalagmites while laryngitis slay 
 All that parasites that come from Paraguay in the spring 
 Hmm hmm hmmm 
 Snarling equinox among the rocks will seize you 
 And the fahrenheit comes out at night to freeze you 
 Wild duodenum are lurking in the trees 
 And the jungle swarms with green apostrophes 
 Oh the Amazon is calling me 
 On the Amazon the pax vobiscum bite 
 On the Amazon the epiglottis fight 
 On the Amazon the hemispheres at night all slink where the agnostics drink 
 All the hippodromes that lie concealed in mud 
 Hunt the metronomes that live in swamp and flood 
 Then the kodachromes run out and drink their blood poor ginks 
 While velocipedes among the weeds will scare you 
 And the menopause with hungry jaws ensnares you 
 Frenzied adenoids infest the hills and slopes 
 Everyone avoids the deadly stethoscopes 
 Oh the Amazon is calling 
 Yes the Amazon is calling 
 Oh the Amazon is calling meeeAs I was agwine down the road 
 With a tired team and a heavy load 
 I crackd my whip and the leader sprung 
 I says dayday to the wagon tongue 
 Turkey in the straw turkey in the hay 
 Roll em up and twist em up a high tuckahaw 
 And twist em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw 
 Went out to milk and I didnt know how 
 I milked the goat instead of the cow 
 A monkey sittin on a pile of straw 
 Awinkin at his motherinlaw 
 Met Mr Catfish comin down stream 
 Says Mr Catfish What does you mean 
 Caught Mr Catfish by the snout 
 And turned Mr Catfish wrong side out 
 Came to a river and I couldnt get across 
 Paid five dollars for a blind old hoss 
 Wouldnt go ahead nor he wouldnt stand still 
 So he went up and down like an old saw mill 
 As I came down the new cut road 
 Met Mr Bullfrog met Miss Toad 
 And every time Miss Toad would sing 
 Old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing 
 Oh I jumped in the seat and I gave a little yell 
 The horses ran away broke the wagon all to hell 
 Sugar in the gourd and honey in the horn 
 I never been so happy since the day I was born 
 And twist em up a tune called Turkey in the StrawTheres a saying old says that love is blind 
 Still were often told seek and ye shall find 
 So Im going to seek a certain lad Ive had in mind 
 Looking everywhere havent found him yet 
 Hes the big affair I cannot forget 
 Only man I ever think of with regret 
 Id like to add his initial to my monogram 
 Tell me where is the shepherd for this lost lamb 
 Theres a somebody Im longing to see 
 I hope that he turns out to be 
 Someone wholl watch over me 
 Im a little lamb whos lost in the wood 
 I know I could always be good 
 Although he may not be the man some 
 Girls think of as handsome 
 To my heart he carries the key 
 Wont you tell him please to put on some speed 
 Follow my lead oh how I need 
 Someone to watch over meO little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 For Christ is born of Mary 
 And gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love 
 O morning stars together 
 Proclaim the holy birth 
 And praises sing to God the King 
 And peace to men on earth 
 O holy Child of Bethlehem 
 Descend to us we pray 
 Cast out our sin and enter in 
 Be born in us today 
 We hear the Christmas Angels 
 The great glad tidings see 
 For born to us in Bethlehem 
 Is Jesus Christ the King 
 Born to us in Bethlehem 
 Is Jesus Christ the KingA step in the right direction a stitch in time saves nine 
 To me you are perfection and the love you saved was mine 
 When I think of all the girls that Ive ever kissed 
 And the ones that Id wished I could know 
 Its a real short list with just one name youre one in a row 
 Youre a class by yourself 
 Youre the state of the art 
 Youre alone on the shelf 
 Youre the top of the chart 
 Youre the singular case 
 Youre the queen of the place 
 Youre the star of the show 
 Youre one in a row 
 Theres one chance in a million theres one sun up in the sky 
 Im glad you were willin and heres the reason why 
 Youre the unrivaled champ 
 Youre the boss of the camp 
 Youre the mavin of charm 
 Youre a shot in the arm 
 Youre alone in the bunch 
 Youre a dark horse hunch 
 Youre a heavyweight blow 
 Youre one in a rowBy the waters 
 The waters 
 Of Babylon 
 We lay down and wept 
 And wept 
 For thee Zion 
 We remember 
 Thee remember 
 Thee ZionOnce I lived the life of a millionaire 
 Spending my money I didnt care 
 I carried my friends out for a good time 
 Bying bootleg liquor champagne and wine 
 Then I began to fall so low 
 I didnt have a friend and no place to go 
 So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again 
 Im gonna hold on to it till them eagles green 
 Nobody knows you when you down and out 
 In my pocket not one penny 
 And my friends I havent any 
 But If I ever get on my feet again 
 Then Ill meet my long lost friend 
 Its mighty strange without a doubt 
 I mean when you down and out 
 Mmmmmmmm when youre down and out 
 Mmmmmmmm not one penny 
 Mmmmmmmm Well I felt so low 
 Nobody wants me round their door 
 Mmmmmmmm Without a doubt 
 No man can use you wen you down and out 
 I mean when you down and outI got no money got no job Im just another shufflin slob 
 Well weve all been disappointed weve had our dreams before 
 For with dreams you learn to take your turn 
 In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore 
 Some believe in Jesus They dont act like they do 
 Some believe in Mohammed I dont believe thats true 
 Cause they do believe in money and gold is what its for 
 All the gold cant buy no peace of mind 
 She is a woman with a baby child A sacrificed human Now shes runnin wild 
 Well her dreams have all been shattered her dignity defiled 
 She has lost her way but she must stay 
 Some believe in love Where did it go 
 Some believe in children Even they now know 
 That we do believe in money and gold is what its for 
 I believe in you I believe in me and I dont care what the papers say 
 I believe in struggle I believe in life I believe that we will find a way 
 I believe in hope I believe in dreams I believe in luck I believe in schemes 
 I believe in fate I believe in time I believe what I believe aint worth a dime 
 Cause we do believe in money and gold is what its for 
 Ill go on livin Ill pay the cost Ill keep on givin to those who are lost 
 Cause the children will be coming and theyll soon know the score 
 They must understand Ive played my hand 
 In a world that dont believeIve got your picture that you gave to me 
 And its signed with love just like it used to be 
 The only thing different the only thing new 
 Ive got your picture hes with you 
 Ive got the records that we used to share 
 And they sound the same as when you were here 
 Ive got your records hes got you 
 Ive got your memory or has it got me 
 I really dont know but I know it wont let me be 
 Ive got your class ring oh that proved youd care 
 And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear 
 Ive got these things and hes with youI dont know why I did it I guess I lost my head 
 I should have said I love you but used angry words instead 
 Angry words that were so unfair 
 Angry words I should have said I care 
 Its easy to apologize its harder to forget 
 You made the loving easy but I made you so upset 
 With angry words that were so unfair 
 Ive stood right beside you Ive changed in many ways 
 I stand here ever faithful but I still have my bad days 
 And angry words can sometimes fly 
 Angry words where once I use to cry 
 With angry words that were so unfair 
 Angry words that were so unfair 
 I should have said I careWinter has me in its grip 
 Think Ill take a summer trip 
 On a sunny sailing ship 
 Where the shells lie in the sand 
 I feel so lonely 
 Im to young to feel this old 
 I need you and you only 
 When the weather gets this cold Thats why 
 Winter has me in its grip 
 Theres no use in going 
 Cause its cold inside my heart 
 And its always snowing 
 Since the day we broke apart 
 Where the shells lie in the sand 
 I tried to run from winter 
 Like this spring and summer run to fall 
 But when the weathers in you 
 Theres no hiding place at all thats why 
 Where the shells lie in the sandI want her so bad 
 Mother Nature has a hold on me 
 I want her so bad 
 Mother Nature wont you let me be untied 
 Cause it hurts my pride 
 To be tossed off like the morning covers 
 And crossed off like her other lovers 
 Casually 
 I see her walking by my window mhmmhmmhmmhmm 
 It seems to me I know her well 
 But like the flowers in the springtime 
 Growing toward the sunshine 
 Her beauty falls upon me in a fragrant springtime spell 
 And I want her so baaaaad 
 Mother Nature has a HOLD on me 
 Is she an icy winter woman Mmhhmm 
 That chills my body when shes near 
 Sweet fever in the morning 
 I dont know if Ill survive 
 She walks by me as though she didnt 
 Know I was alive 
 Tossed off like the morning covers 
 Crossed off like her other lovers 
 Crossed off like her other loversFrom what I have been hearing dear youve really got it made 
 Got a lot of fellers on your lovers hit parade 
 If I cant be your number one I dont know what Ill do 
 Gotta get my love up to the top Im so in love with you 
 On the hit parade of love I know Ill never stop 
 Ive got a long long way to climb before I reach the top 
 But if I do get there soon Ill really have it made 
 Then Ill know Im number one on your lovers hit parade 
 Well we get along dear like all good lovers should 
 Yet we could make a go of it I know itd turn out good 
 We could have so much fun wed really have it made 
 Then I know Im number one on your lovers hit parade 
 Well its your heart Im after dear cause youre so nice and fine 
 And another to replace you dear would sure be hard to find 
 So put your arms around me now and call me turtle dove 
 Then I know Im number one on your hit parade of love 
 Then I know Im number one on your lovers hit paradeNo one can take your place with me 
 And time has proven that Im right 
 Theres no place Id rather be 
 Than at your place for the night 
 No time can pass your sight unseen 
 No moment steals away unfound 
 Lifetime lived in such a dream 
 Floats like a feather to the ground 
 And for the first time Ive been seeing 
 The things Id never notice without you 
 And for the first time Im discovering 
 The things I used to treasure about you 
 The birds like leaves on Winterwood 
 Sing hopeful songs on dismal days 
 Theyve learned to live life as they should 
 They are at peace with Natures ways 
 You are as natural as the night 
 And all that springs from you is good 
 And the children born beneath your light 
 Are like the birds on Winterwood 
 The things I used to treasure about youI find you in my arms this is how it begins 
 Still nobody can see that were joined at the heartIsnt it strange how a man hides his feelings 
 Sometimes the one that he loves never knows 
 And isnt strange when shes finally leaving 
 That it all starts to show when she goes 
 I passed my friend he didnt look the way he did before 
 I always knew he was a stronger man than me 
 I asked my friend if he needed any help from me 
 He said shes all I need I know you know 
 I only wish I had told her long ago 
 Isnt it strange how a man hides his feelings 
 I once found love but never got beyond my selfish dreams 
 I took for granted that shed be there every day 
 I closed her out knowing she could never change he lovin ways 
 Things fell apart and she got scared 
 I wonder if she knew how much I really cared 
 That it all starts to show when she goes starts to go away 
 Yeah isnt it strange when shes finally leaving 
 You may find love if you do youre fortunate 
 Cause thats the rarest thing in all the world youll find 
 Someone who cares who shares the good an bad of it 
 You just make sure she understands how much you care 
 And wherever you may go she will be there 
 That it all starts to show when she goes starts to go awayI coulda been most anything I put my mind to be 
 But a cowboys life was the only life for me 
 Its a strong mans occupation ridin herd and livin free 
 But strong men often fail 
 Where shrewd men can prevail 
 Im an old man now with nothin left to say 
 But oh god how I worked my youth away 
 Well you may not recognise my face I used to be a star 
 A cowboy hero known both near and far 
 I perched upon a silver mount and sang with my guitar 
 But the studio of course 
 Owned my saddle and my horse 
 But that sixgun on the wall belongs to me 
 Oh god I cant live a memory 
 You know Id like to put my finger on that trigger once again 
 And point that gun at all the prideful men 
 All the voyeurs and the lawyers who can pull a fountain pen 
 And put you where they choose 
 With the language that they use 
 And enslave you till you work your youth away 
 Oh god how I worked my youth away 
 Whoopee ty yioh 
 Whoopee ty yi ay 
 One mans work is another mans play 
 You see I always liked the notion of a cowboy fighting crime 
 This photograph was taken in my prime 
 I could beat those desperados but theres no sense fightin time 
 But the singin was a ball 
 Cause Im not musical at all 
 I moved my lips to someone elses voice 
 I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be 
 But oh god how I worked my youth awayTime goes by and I still love you 
 Place no one on earth above you 
 Time goes by and still I havent changed 
 Time goes by and I still miss you 
 Wanna hold you close and kiss you 
 You told me to forget you 
 And find somebody new 
 But I dont want somebody else 
 Im still in love with you 
 I love you and you should know it 
 What else must I do to show it 
 I love you I do so madly 
 So completely and so gladly 
 Like a ship that needs a captain 
 I need you thats all Im askin 
 So give me what I cry for 
 Its you Im thinkin of 
 I cant be any different 
 You see Im still in love 
 Say you care and really show it 
 Hold me close and make me know it 
 Time goes by and still I havent changedThere you go and baby here am I 
 Well you left me here so I could sit and cry 
 Well golly gee what have you done to me 
 Well I guess it doesnt matter any more 
 Do you remember baby last September 
 How you held me tight each and every night 
 Well whoopsy daisy how you drove me crazy 
 Theres no use in me acryin 
 Ive done everything and now Im sick of tryin 
 Ive thrown away my nights 
 Wasted all my days over you 
 Now you go your way and Ill go mine 
 Now and forever till the end of time 
 Ill find somebody new and baby well say were through 
 And you wont matter anymore 
 Well you go your way and Ill go mine 
 And you wont matter anymoreWhen I see you on the street I lose my concentration Just the thought that we 
 Might meet creates anticipation 
 Wont you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to 
 Know Well Ive been thinkin about you day and night and I dont know if 
 Itll work out right but somehow I think that it just might if we try 
 Faces come and faces go in circular rotation But something yearns within to 
 Grow beyond infatuation 
 Know Well youve got me standin deaf and blind cause I see love as just a 
 State of mind and who knows what it is that we might find if we try 
 Youre walking a different direction from most people Ive met Youre givin 
 Me signs of affection I dont usually get I dont want you to pledge your 
 Future the futures not yours to give Just stand there a little longer and let 
 Me watch while you live 
 Cause when I see you on the street I lose my concentration And just the 
 Thought that we might meet creates anticipation 
 Know Well Ive been thinking about you day and night and I dont know if it 
 Will work out right but somehow I think that it just might if we try 
 Somehow I think that it just might if we try Yes somehow I think that it just 
 Might if we tryspoken 
 One two three four 
 Fortune has me well in hand armies wait at my command 
 My gold lies in a foreign land buried deep beneath the sand 
 The angels guide my evry tread my enemies are sick or dead 
 But all the victories Ive led havent brought you to my bed 
 You see everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you 
 Wont ya tell me what did I do to offend you 
 Now the purest race Ive bred for thee to live in my democracy 
 And the highest human pedigree awaits the firstborn boy baby 
 And my face on evry coin engraved the anarchists are all enslaved 
 My own flag is forever waved by the grateful people I have saved 
 Now no land is beyond my claim when the land is seized in the peoples name 
 By evil men who rob and maim if war is hell Im not to blame 
 Why you cant blame me Im Heavens child Im the second son of Mary mild 
 And Im twice removed from Oscar Wilde but he didnt mind why he just smiled 
 Yes and the ocean parts when I walk through and the clouds dissolve and the sky turns blue 
 Im held in very great value by everyone I meet but you 
 Cause Ive used my talents as I could Ive done some bad Ive done some good 
 I did a whole lot better than they thought I would so cmon and treat me like you should 
 Because everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you 
 Tell me what did I do to offend you whoo yeah 
 Everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you 
 Tell me what did I do to offend you 
 Yeah everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you 
 Tell me what did I do to offend youThere was a mummy at the fair all crumpled in a folding chair 
 The people passed but didnt care that the mummy was a man 
 So tell me if you can 
 Who are you Who are you 
 Where have you been where are you going to 
 Well Andrew McCrew must have lost his way 
 Cause though he died long ago he was buried today 
 Down on nightmare alley where the shady people sway 
 A hobo came ahikin on a salty summer day 
 Well he hopped a freight in Dallas and he rode out of sight 
 But on a turn he slipped and he lost his grip 
 And he fell into the night 
 Well Andrew had one leg of wood the other leg was small 
 And when he fell off the train that night he found he had no legs at all 
 Well they found him in the thicket and the undertaker came 
 And they mummified his body for a relative to claim 
 But no one came to claim him until the carnival passed through 
 The carnies took him to their tent and they decided what to do 
 Well they dressed him in a wornout tux and they put him on a stand 
 And millions saw the legend called the famous mummy man 
 Well what a way to live a life and what a way to die 
 Left to live a living death with no one left to cry 
 Petrified amazement and wonder beyond worth 
 A man who found more life in death than life gave him at birth 
 But what about the ones who live and wish that they could go 
 Whose lives are lost to living and performing for the show 
 Well at least you got the best of life until it got the best of you 
 So from all of us to whats left of you 
 Farewell Andrew McCrewIm a travelin man 
 Ive made a lot of stops all over the world 
 And in every part I own the heart 
 Of at least one lovely girl 
 Ive a pretty Seniorita waiting for me 
 Down in old Mexico 
 If youre ever in Alaska stop and see 
 My cute little Eskimo 
 Oh my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town 
 Makes my heart start to yearn 
 And my China doll down in old Hong Kong 
 Waits for my return 
 Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea 
 I remember the night 
 When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki 
 And I held you oh so tight 
 Oh Im a travelin man 
 Yes Im a travelin manYou have lived such a gentle life upon this earth 
 That I am stunned by your sight 
 If I could give but a token of the love you have 
 Then I might not be this lonely tonight 
 Let them have their smug and their cool confined by fashion and peer 
 I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere 
 Oh there are so few brave ones like you Need I explain 
 Never wondering what to do what to venture what to gain 
 And you have loved in a total way from flesh to soul 
 You speak without coy without pose 
 Your eyes can see that the emperor has lost his clothes 
 And whats more youll tell the whole world what he stole 
 Let them have their fad and their fix confined by fashion and peer 
 I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphereI dont want to be like old George Reeves 
 Stuck in a Superman role 
 Ive got a long way to go in my career 
 And some day my fame will make it clear 
 That I had to be a Superman 
 He came from another place deep in his mind 
 As far as the planets in space 
 As galaxys mysteries start to unwind 
 Some changes are bound to take place 
 Though gravity constantly weighs on my travels 
 My mission is close to adrift 
 Though I can be strong when my power unravels 
 I still come to you for a lift 
 I dont want to be like old George Reeves 
 I know I can fly when my plane hits the sky 
 I believe Ive got nothing to lose 
 But when Im alone with the bed and the phone 
 I get the terminal metropolis blues 
 I flew to the coast where Supermans Ghost 
 Lay shot on the bedroom floor 
 He said Watch out for TV it crucified me 
 But it cant crucify me no more 
 Im red white and blue Ive got justice to do 
 Im the man of your fantasy dreams 
 But Im an alien man from an alien land 
 Whos alive on your orthicon screens 
 I once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled 
 I performed for you live not on tape 
 But the public is cruel when played for a fool 
 As you see by the blood on my cape 
 Well I never was real or stronger than steel 
 Im a figment of Freudian need 
 And the video screen is a psychotic scene 
 And its all done with mirrors and green 
 My agent just called the talks have been stalled 
 I soon will be pulled from the air 
 But the image persists in the video mists 
 That a Superman still will be there 
 That I had to be a SupermanSometimes when Im thinkin that loves not around 
 My heart begins sinkin I dont hear a sound 
 And the world is in blackness no light shines on me 
 I suffer no blindness no one can I see 
 Then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire 
 And the silence is broken and the night is on fire 
 Its like chain lightning this love that I feel 
 Who knows where it strikes or when it will hit 
 How long it will last or when it will quit 
 In the forest Im burning struck down by the blast 
 The fever is churning and the heat rises fast 
 And those standing nearest can show their concern 
 But I swear if they touch me that they too will burn 
 They fear for their lives for death will soon dwell 
 In the warmth of your love is the fire of hell 
 Who knows where it strikes or when it will hit 
 And soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame 
 And love will soon shatter what it cannot tame 
 And the cycle continues from life into dust 
 For I am now in you with the fire of lust 
 And I hear the explosion of thunder and rain 
 The water is falling the ashes remain 
 Who knows where it strikes or when it will hit 
 The Indians tell us that the phoenix can rise 
 From the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes 
 And watch beautiful colours from black and from grey 
 Be formed into wings and take me away 
 Where evil is darkness and goodness is light 
 And love is the lightning that cuts through the night 
 And strikes only once in a dark place in time 
 And forms a gold stairway that all of us climbRust on your fingers you got rubble at your feet 
 Keep the home fires burning but look out for the heat 
 Cause theres a man at the window who knows just what you think 
 And theres a water boy behind you who wont give you a drink 
 Well its a hard hard times no easy road in sight 
 It takes a great big man to win a great big fight 
 When it comes to dying no matter what you tell 
 Theyre gonna let you into heaven cause you lived your life in hell 
 Well theyve got no way to reward you but to let those breezes blow 
 And youve got nothing left to do but to let your anger show 
 Cause its a hard hard time no easy road in sight 
 Think about your baby think about your wife 
 Just think about your banker whos trying to take your life 
 Think about this planet thats rolling through the night 
 Then tell me 
 Can you turn your back on such a great big fight 
 Youve got the muscle big man you got the power 
 But youre getting weaker with each passing hour 
 Just like a flame in the rain like a light in the night 
 Well if its you that must stay well then its you that must fight 
 Cause its a hard hard time your futures not bright 
 It takes a great big man to win a great big 
 Great big man to win a great big fightI chased a lot of rainbows 
 Down a lot of roads 
 Thinking love was something to be bought or sold 
 But I finally found a treasure 
 And its right here in your eyes 
 Now my golden dreams are of golden rings 
 Precious love without a price 
 Im going for the gold 
 For the hearts thats in you 
 Im going for the love 
 That I know will be true 
 Ive had enough 
 Of those one night stands 
 Im going for the gold thats in a wedding band 
 I followed those illusions 
 That sparkled in the night 
 But they were fantasies that disappeared in the light 
 The midnight fires that burned so bright 
 Turn to ashes in the dawn 
 I didnt realize how empty I was inside 
 Until you came along 
 Im going for the gold thats in a wedding bandOh Mary this Londons a wonderful sight 
 With people here working by day and by night 
 They dont sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat 
 But theres gangs of them diggin for gold in the street 
 At least when I asked them thats what I was told 
 So I just took a hand at this diggin for gold 
 But for all that Ive found there I might as well be 
 In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea 
 I believe that when writin a wish you expressed 
 As to how the fine ladies of London were dressed 
 But if youll believe me when asked to a ball 
 They dont wear no tops to their dresses at all 
 Oh Ive seen them myself and you could not in truth 
 Tell if they were bound for a ball or a bath 
 Dont be startin them fashions now Mary McRee 
 Theres beautiful girls here oh never you mind 
 Beautiful shapes nature never designed 
 Lovely complexions of roses and cream 
 But let me remark with regard to the same 
 That if at those roses you venture to sit 
 The colors might all come away on your lip 
 So Ill wait for the wild rose thats waitin for me 
 You remember young Diddy McClaren of course 
 But hes over here with the rest of the force 
 I saw him one day as he stood on the strand 
 Stopped all the traffic with a wave of his hand 
 As we were talking of days that are gone 
 The whole town of London stood there to look on 
 But for all his great powers hes wishful like me 
 To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the seaIn Nineteen Sixty Seven the draft caught up with me 
 Me and my pal Joe went off to war 
 We might find heros heaven but wed keep the country free 
 We would surely win just like before 
 Roy Rogers he was on his horse and Buck Jones drew his gun 
 We would surely win of course when the battle was all done 
 Nineteen Sixty Seven I came back alone 
 They brought Joe back in plastic on the plane 
 Nineteen Sixty Seven seems so long ago 
 But I cant forget my friend or ease my pain 
 His family may forget him his children may regret him 
 His wife may find another and go on 
 His picture may grow faded and the world he knew gone jaded 
 But as long as I shall live I surely know 
 I never will forget my buddy Joe 
 In Nineteen Sixty Seven the war was raging on 
 Our country was divided and reborn 
 Though I was back at home I had never left Saigon 
 Cause all I got was ridicule and scorn 
 This was no place for heros now they all seemed to resent me 
 They saidThe river of love is risin at my doorstep it wont let me be 
 I keep dreamin of you and what the river will do 
 As it starts flowin over me 
 The river of love is risin by my window it wont let me sleep 
 Its so windy and black and theres no turnin back 
 Cause I know Im in so deep 
 In so deep in so deep 
 In so deep 
 So deep in the river of love 
 I got to go where it takes me 
 I got to follow the flow 
 I got to follow that feelin 
 Wherever the river may go 
 The river of love is always all around me since I took my leap 
 It will carry me through and keep me with you 
 Cause you know Im in so deep 
 The river of loveOn the first floor On the first floor 
 On the first floor theres a young girl reeling 
 Her bodys numb and without feeling 
 As illusions dance on the midnight ceiling 
 Now shes falling now shes kneeling 
 Its almost like shes bowed in prayer 
 A savior shes about to bear 
 She screams for help but no ones there 
 On the first floor 
 On the first floor people walk the halls 
 But none can hear her desperate calls 
 There is no sound beyond the walls 
 So to the telephone she crawls 
 She telephones her only friend 
 The one on whom she can depend 
 But the phone rings on without an end 
 Then rings no more On the first floor 
 Theres a party on the second floor 
 And through the picture window you can see them all 
 Theyre laughing and theyre dancing 
 Admiring the Renoir thats hanging on the wall 
 But in the master bedroom where the coats are piled high 
 A silent satin lady thinks of what its like to die 
 And as she dwells on all the years she still has left to face 
 She wonders how shell ever find someone to take his place 
 Then suddenly shes jarred by the ringing of the phone 
 Oh why do you ring now just when I want to be alone 
 So she walks into the bathroom and drinks some water from a cup 
 But the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up 
 My family was very poor 
 So I worked hard to be secure 
 I married one I had to wed 
 And not the one I loved instead 
 When I was young my blood ran wild 
 But we stayed married for the child 
 Now three flights up Im all alone 
 My wife is dead my child is grown 
 My daughter leads a wayward life 
 Shes been a failure as a wife 
 And though she lives just one floor down 
 She never calls or comes around 
 Step off the platform and onto the train 
 Look out your window and into the rain 
 Watch all the buildings that pass as you ride 
 And count all the stories that go on inside 
 And then ask yourself if it must be this way 
 Should walls and doors and plaster ceilings 
 Separate us from each others feelingsRound and round the years go round and round 
 And many a dream is lost in the nasty city sound 
 Now shes down and out everyones above her 
 Tried everything a gal could try 
 She takes the notion that nobody loves her 
 And heres the reason why 
 She came to the city like a good gal should 
 Found a little pad in a bad neighborhood 
 She learned about life and it was quite a shock 
 But now she knocks em down with the best on the block 
 Ah right 
 Yeah and its really a shame too 
 Cause she was her daddys pride and joy 
 Daddy wont you buy that pretty dolly for me 
 Its the only toy I ever wanted 
 Wont you take me for a walk in the park 
 I love the big brass band 
 And the chestnut stand 
 And that sad old man 
 Round and round the years go round and round 
 Oh but shes wrong you know 
 Because I love herShow the world and all its people 
 All the wonders love can bring 
 Give us strength and understanding 
 Give us all one song to sing 
 Let the music play 
 Play it loud and make it clear 
 Its time to stand up 
 To a new world that is now so near 
 From the bottom to the top 
 To the leaders of the land 
 We all have one heart 
 Everyone of us must lend a hand 
 And let there be joy in the world 
 And let there be no sorrow 
 Let there be 
 And let there be peace on earth 
 For all the world 
 Weve got to see 
 That love oh love 
 What a blessed thing oh yeah 
 Say it loud 
 Make it clear today 
 All the walls are falling down 
 No more children off to war 
 If we search in our hearts 
 All the suffering will be no more 
 For all gods children 
 Let them see 
 And freedom no more lies 
 We can save this world if we try 
 One world I know we can make it 
 Yes its only in your heart 
 Yes its only in your dreams 
 You can climb the highest mountains 
 You can make the whole world sing 
 Love oh love 
 Make it clear todayHush little baby dont say a word 
 Mamas gonna buy you a mockingbird 
 And if that mockingbird wont sing 
 Mamas gonna buy you a diamond ring 
 And if that diamond ring turns brass 
 Mamas gonna buy you a looking glass 
 And if that looking glass gets broke 
 Mamas gonna buy you a billy goat 
 And if that billy goat wont pull 
 Mamas gonna buy you a cart and bull 
 And if that cart and bull turn over 
 Mamas going to buy you a dog named Rover 
 And if that dog named Rover wont bark 
 Mamas going to buy you a horse and cart 
 And if that horse and cart fall down 
 Youll still be the sweetest little baby in townThey were married in the old Church yard 
 And they promised to be true to each other 
 No matter how hard their lives might be 
 But like meteors that fell through moments parallel 
 They were soon to cross 
 And on different plots of earth they both did fall 
 Though their lives had really not been hard at all 
 Oh my what a shame 
 No ones to blame 
 It just happened that way 
 And theres nothing you can say 
 When two people say goodbye 
 Oh my 
 Two brothers promised theyd return 
 When the war that they were fighting was over 
 But only one lived to keep his vow 
 And the story I was told said he lived to be quite old 
 Before time won out 
 Someone asked if he knew what they both fought for 
 But he could not recall he had ever been to war 
 For theres nothing you can say when its over 
 And theres nothing you can do when its done 
 Theres no battle you can win 
 And theres nothing to begin 
 Thats not begun 
 On this moment I recall your face 
 And I wonder if you still think about me 
 Occasionally I still think of you 
 And I watch the river flow and I know I must let go 
 But its oh so hard 
 For the waves are all around my small canoe 
 I had always hoped this boat could carry two 
 Oh myI feel like a spinning top or a dreidel 
 The spinning dont stop when you leave the cradle 
 You just slow down 
 Round and around this world you go 
 Spinning through the lives of the people you know 
 We all slow down 
 How you gonna keep on turning from day to day 
 How you gonna keep from turning your life away 
 No days you can borrow no time you can buy 
 No trust in tomorrow its a lie 
 I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel 
 And I feel like Im dippin and divin 
 My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels 
 Im lost in this star car Im drivin 
 But my air sole keeps pushin big wheels 
 My world is a constant confusion 
 My mind is prepared to attack 
 My past a persuasive illusion 
 Im watchin the future its black 
 What do you know 
 You know just what you perceive 
 What can you show 
 Nothing of what you believe 
 And as you grow 
 Each thread of life that you leave 
 Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs 
 As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds 
 And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds 
 And your habits grow and your conscience feeds 
 On all that you thought you should be 
 I never thought this could happen to me 
 How you gonna keep from turning your life away Oh 
 You just 
 Slow 
 DownWell I got crazy yesterday and I called her to say 
 Please baby wont you come home tonight 
 I cant even trust my brain to get my heart in from the rain 
 I know that girls a hurricane in her own right 
 Then early this mornin after she was goin 
 I sat there in my chair all alone 
 Well I called my friend cryin and asked him why 
 That girl was always doing me so wrong 
 He said When the gates are all down and the signals are flashin 
 The whistle is screamin in vain 
 And you stay on the tracks ignoring the facts 
 Well you cant blame the wreck on the train 
 No you cant blame the wreck on the train 
 Well how many times have I promised myself 
 Not to do the same thing as before 
 I swear I will leave it alone and believe it 
 Then Ill turn around and do it some more 
 Oh fool me one time and its shame on you 
 Fool me twice and its shame on me 
 Thats what my best friend warned me when I called him this mornin 
 Then he reminded me 
 And the whistle is screamin in vain 
 No you cant blame the wreck on the train 
 Man you gotta quit blamin the trainLove hurts love scars love wounds and mars 
 Any heart not tough or strong enough 
 To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain 
 Love is like a cloud it holds a lot of rain 
 Love hurts oohooh love hurts 
 Im young I know but even so 
 I know a thing or two I learned from you 
 I really learned a lot really learned a lot 
 Love is like a flame it burns you when its hot 
 Some fools think of happiness blissfulness togetherness 
 Some fools fool themselves I guess theyre not foolin me 
 I know it isnt true I know it isnt true 
 Love is just a lie made to make you blue 
 Love hurts oohooh love hurts oohooh love hurtsDont know much about history 
 Dont know much biology 
 Dont know much about a science book 
 Dont know much about the French I took 
 But I do know that I love you 
 And I know that if you love me too 
 What a wonderful world this would be 
 Dont know much about geography 
 Dont know much trigonometry 
 Dont know much about algebra 
 Dont know what a slide rule is for 
 But I do know that one and one is two 
 And if this one could be with you 
 Now I dont claim to be an A student 
 But Im tryin to be 
 For maybe by being an A student baby 
 I can win your love for me 
 Dont know much about history 
 Dont know much biology 
 History 
 Biology 
 Science book 
 French I took 
 What a wonderful world this would beIn the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand 
 And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land 
 And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new 
 And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew 
 And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their kind 
 And man was but a molecule that God had left behind 
 We have grown we have grown we have captured the throne 
 Of the kingdom God made for our winning 
 We have grown we have grown but our children alone 
 Have so little time left for beginning 
 And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life 
 And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife 
 And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea 
 While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony 
 And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land 
 And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand 
 And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall 
 The drop of blood became a man the tree of life grew tall 
 And perfect in his loneliness a rib pulled from his chest 
 Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast 
 And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat 
 And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet 
 Tree of knowledge tree of death upon the ground they trod 
 The serpent said your eyes will see and ye will be a god 
 Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die 
 And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky 
 And man was banished east of Eden See what we have lost 
 For though the father sets the price the children pay the cost 
 Have so little time left for beginningWindows in a silent room 
 Sunlight burns the walls to black 
 Angles and dimensions melt 
 While colors drip and pillows crack 
 Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet 
 A ribbon film of separate frames 
 Lying curled up at my feet 
 The film is just a snakedesign 
 And the photographs are fading fast 
 These are not memories of mine 
 I have no future no past 
 I have seen a thousand afternoons 
 Dissolve into the night 
 Like sugar crystals on a spoon 
 They disappear from sight 
 Grey days from the crispest morning 
 To the warmest afternoon 
 In this room 
 And I like to draw 
 The face I saw so long ago 
 My image in the mirror tells the jagged lines 
 Which way to go 
 A blackandwhite description of 
 The sole survivor of the Holocaust 
 All the rest were lost 
 Do you see this paper face 
 It has no color or no mood 
 My eyes are ageless as am I 
 I need no sleep I need no food 
 I am a king But like a child 
 The other children laugh at me 
 Tongues of fire wagging wild 
 They dance around me merrily 
 Ill kill them all 
 And if I fail 
 Ill kill whoever I can find 
 Then theyll beg me to be kind 
 My eyes have seen far more 
 Than eyes can ever tell 
 This planet plunged through mushroom fires 
 Of earthly hell 
 I know that my sweet Jesus said He would return 
 But Babylon has fallen 
 And the cities 
 BurnThe lonesome sight of a train going by 
 Makes me wanna stop and cry 
 Oh I recall the day they took you away 
 Im blue Im lonesome too 
 And when I hear that lonesome whistle blow 
 I want to pack my trunk and go 
 Oh the lonesome sight of a train going by 
 Makes me want to stop and cry 
 Makes me want to stop and cryWell you better jump jump jump 
 If you wanna live at all 
 Yes you better jump jump jump 
 Even though youre bound to fall 
 Cause theyre gonna make you sorry gonna make you cry 
 If you dont jump jump jump into the seat by and by 
 Well you jump for joy and happiness 
 You jump when things go right 
 You jump when youre asleep 
 And you hear a strange voice in the night 
 Sometimes we get to use to things they dont mean what they did 
 I know that what make my floor make another fellows lid 
 Well you better jump jump jump 
 Well Im always on the lookout 
 For somethin fresh and new 
 Like bein on a cookout with a crazy Kangaroo 
 Just when I think Ive found a place where Im sure I wanna stop 
 My body wont quit cookin and my mind begins to hop 
 Well Im thinkin about a thousand things 
 Im a losin lots of sleep 
 Im glidin on my inner wings Im gettin set to leap 
 Im ridin on my pony Im lettin out my rope 
 Im lookin for an idea that a big bar of soap 
 Well one man was cold and hungry 
 One man was rich and well 
 One man stood at the window as the crowd began to yell 
 While the poor man prayed to Jesus and the rich man made a deal 
 One man was standing naked yellin do what you feel 
 If you dont jump jump jump into the seat by and byHappy trails to you until we meet again 
 Happy trails to you keep smilin until then 
 Who cares about the clouds when were together 
 Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather 
 Happy trails to you till we meet again 
 Some trails are happy ones 
 Others are blue 
 Its the way you ride the trail that counts 
 Heres a happy one for you 
 Happy trails to you until we meet again 
 Happy trails to you till we meet againA long long time ago 
 I can still remember how that music used to make me smile 
 And I knew if I had my chance 
 That I could make those people dance 
 And maybe theyd be happy for a while 
 But February made me shiver 
 With every paper Id deliver 
 Bad news on the doorstep 
 I couldnt take one more step 
 I cant remember if I cried 
 When I read about his widowed bride 
 But something touched me deep inside 
 The day the music died 
 So byebye Miss American Pie 
 Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry 
 And them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye 
 Singin Thisll be the day that I die 
 Thisll be the day that I die 
 Did you write the book of love 
 And do you have faith in God above 
 If the Bible tells you so 
 Now do you believe in rock and roll 
 Can music save your mortal soul 
 And can you teach me how to dance real slow 
 Well I know that youre in love with him 
 Cause I saw you dancin in the gym 
 You both kicked off your shoes 
 Man I dig those rhythm and blues 
 I was a lonely teenage bronkin buck 
 With a pink carnation and a pickup truck 
 But I knew I was out of luck 
 I started singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye 
 Now for ten years weve been on our own 
 And moss grows fat on a rollin stone 
 But thats not how it used to be 
 When the jester sang for the king and queen 
 In a coat he borrowed from James Dean 
 And a voice that came from you and me 
 Oh and while the king was looking down 
 The jester stole his thorny crown 
 The courtroom was adjourned 
 No verdict was returned 
 And while Lenin read a book on Marx 
 A quartet practiced in the park 
 And we sang dirges in the dark 
 We were singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 Helter skelter in a summer swelter 
 The birds flew off with a fallout shelter 
 Eight miles high and falling fast 
 It landed foul on the grass 
 The players tried for a forward pass 
 With the jester on the sidelines in a cast 
 Now the halftime air was sweet perfume 
 While the sergeants played a marching tune 
 We all got up to dance 
 Oh but we never got the chance 
 Cause the players tried to take the field 
 The marching band refused to yield 
 Do you recall what was revealed 
 The day the music died 
 We started singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 And singin Thisll be the day that I die 
 Oh and there we were all in one place 
 A generation lost in space 
 With no time left to start again 
 So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick 
 Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 
 Cause fire is the devils only friend 
 Oh and as I watched him on the stage 
 My hands were clenched in fists of rage 
 No angel born in Hell 
 Could break that Satans spell 
 And as the flames climbed high into the night 
 To light the sacrificial rite 
 I saw Satan laughing with delight 
 He was singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 I met a girl who sang the blues 
 And I asked her for some happy news 
 But she just smiled and turned away 
 I went down to the sacred store 
 Where Id heard the music years before 
 But the man there said the music wouldnt play 
 And in the streets the children screamed 
 The lovers cried and the poets dreamed 
 But not a word was spoken 
 The church bells all were broken 
 And the three men I admire most 
 The Father Son and the Holy Ghost 
 They caught the last train for the coast 
 And they were singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 They were singin byebye Miss American Pie 
 And singin Thisll be the day that I dieEvery thread of creation is held in position 
 By still other strands of things living 
 In an earthly tapestry hung from the skyline 
 Of smouldering cities so gray and so vulgar 
 As not to be satisfied with their own negativity 
 But needing to touch all the living as well 
 And every breeze that blows kindly is one crystal breath 
 We exhale on the blue diamond heaven 
 As gentle to touch as the hands of the healer 
 As soft as farewells whispered over the coffin 
 Were poisoned by venom with each breath we take 
 From the brown sulphur chimney and the black highway snake 
 And every dawn that breaks golden is held in suspension 
 Like the yolk of the egg in albumen 
 Where the birth and the death of unseen generations 
 Are interdependent in vast orchestration 
 And painted in colors of tapestry thread 
 When the dying are born and the living are dead 
 And every pulse of your heartbeat is one liquid moment 
 That flows through the veins of your being 
 Like a river of life flowing on since creation 
 Approaching the sea with each new generation 
 Youre now just a stagnant and rancid disgrace 
 That is rapidly drowning the whole human race 
 And every fish that swims silent every bird that flies freely 
 Every doe that steps softly 
 Every crisp leaf that falls all the flowers that grow 
 On this colorful tapestry somehow they know 
 That if man is allowed to destroy all we need 
 He will soon have to pay with his life for his greedTheres no need to find a reason for your dreams 
 For there is always more to dreaming than there seems to be 
 And Ill be thankful if through out my life you dream of me 
 Its all that I could ask for while I live 
 A dream is such a lovely gift to give 
 Your fragile beauty caught me in its web 
 And I am held by every silver strand of love you spin 
 Here in a swirl of sweeping circles all my dreams begin 
 Dreams that somehow always end with you 
 Youre the one that makes my dreams come true 
 Sleep is lovely when you sleep next to me 
 And while youre dreaming let your thoughts all run free 
 But if I could understand what makes you free 
 Then I would capture you and hold you for eternity 
 But Im afraid that would destroy the love you feel for me 
 And loving you is how it has to be 
 Reasons dont mean anything to me 
 Loving you is how it has to be 
 Reasons dont mean anything to meI was a cowboy ridin the range 
 I got a little boy I guess its not strange 
 I got a little cowboy now 
 We have fun when we shoot our gun 
 He always falls to the ground 
 He rides away with a yippyiay 
 And he makes that pony sound Whinny 
 I was a cowboy ridin the range 
 I saw the cowboys on the TV 
 Now my little boy does just like me 
 He spins a rope and he rides at a lope 
 And he keeps his saddle dry 
 And he makes his pony fly Gallop sound 
 I got a little cowboy nowThe grave that they dug him had flowers 
 Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colours 
 And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone 
 Hes gone 
 When the wars of our nation did beckon 
 A man barely twenty did answer the calling 
 Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation 
 Hes gone 
 But Eternity knows him and it knows what weve done 
 And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers 
 Leaving brown muddy clay where the earth had been dry 
 And deep in the trench he waited for hours 
 As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die 
 But the silence of night was shattered by fire 
 As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air 
 And one after another his comrades were slaughtered 
 In morgue of Marines alone standing there 
 He crouched ever lower ever lower with fear 
 They cant let me die They cant let me die here 
 Ill cover myself with the mud and the earth 
 Ill cover myself I know Im not brave 
 The earth the earth the earth is my grave 
 The grave that they dug him had flowers 
 Hes goneTake me back to my boots and saddle 
 Woohoohooh oohoohooh oohoohahooh 
 Let me see that general store 
 Let me ride that range once more 
 Gimme my boots and saddle 
 Let me ramble along the prairie 
 Ropin steers on old BarX 
 With my buddies Slim and Tex 
 Oh gimme my boots and saddle 
 Got a hankerin to be with a banjo on my knee 
 Strummin a pretty western tune 
 Theres a gal in Cherokee 
 And shes waitin there for me 
 Waitin neath a Texas moon 
 Take me back to my boots and saddle 
 Woohoohooh oohoohooh ahooh 
 Let me greet each blazin morn 
 On the ranch where I was born 
 Oh gimme my boots and saddleCrazy Im crazy for feeling so lonely 
 Im crazy crazy for feeling so blue 
 I knew youd love me as long as you wanted 
 And then someday youd leave me for somebody new 
 Worry why do I let myself worry 
 Wondring what in the world did I do 
 Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you 
 Im crazy for trying and crazy for crying 
 And Im crazy for loving you 
 And Im crazy for loving youWhen evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains 
 And theres nothing left to do but lay around 
 I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail 
 Just to watch the desert sun go down 
 White faced cattle lowing sagebrush everywhere 
 Granite spires are standing all around 
 Ill tell you folks its heaven to go ridin down the trail 
 Ridin down the canyon to watch the sun go down 
 A picture that no artist ere could paint 
 Cactus plants are bloomin on the mountain side 
 I hear a coyote calling to its mate 
 When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains 
 Just to watch the desert sun go downI feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless night 
 Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright 
 Beams of blue come flickering through my windowpane 
 Like Gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame 
 And I wonder if you know 
 That I never understood 
 That although you said youd go 
 Until you did I never thought you would 
 Moonlight use to bath the contours of your face 
 While chestnut hair fell all around the pillowcase 
 And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head 
 A sympathy bouquet left with the love thats dead 
 Never thought the words you said were true 
 Never thought you said just what you meant 
 Never knew how much I needed you 
 Never thought youd leave until you went 
 Morning comes and morning goes with no regret 
 And evening brings the memories I cant forget 
 Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs 
 And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs 
 Until you did I never thought you wouldIn the night while you lay sleeping 
 Dreaming of your amber skies 
 Was a poor boy broken hearted 
 Listening to the winds that sigh 
 My little darling oh how I love you 
 How I love you none can tell 
 In your heart you love another 
 Little darling pal of mine 
 Many a day with you Ive rambled 
 Happiest hours with you Ive spent 
 For I had your heart forever 
 But I find its only lent 
 There is just three things I wish for 
 Thats my casket shroud and grave 
 When Im dead dont weep for me 
 Just like those lips that you betrayedI looked through every barroom 
 And I searched from coast to coast 
 You were scarce as lowcost housing 
 Baby when I needed you most 
 And where were you baby when my heart went out 
 You left me ba by in all this darkness and doubt 
 Now I peeked through fancy boudoirs 
 And I peeked through window grates 
 I only saw Republicans romancing Southern states 
 Now I tried to replace you with a streetwalker named Desire 
 But prices up so high hell I couldnt afford to try her 
 It takes you my baby baby baby  to put my body out 
 You left me baby in all this darkness and doubt 
 But tonight I think Im gonna take some good advice 
 Im gonna look around and find somebody thats a really nice 
 Well perhaps a bankers daughter and if her Papas a cuss 
 Well I hope to do to her what her Papa does to us 
 And well have fancy shack and a fancy Cadillac 
 And shell be studying to be a nymphomaniac 
 And well have a little rye and well play a little gin 
 Well have another rye and well play another gin 
 And then well have another rye just to get a little glow 
 Have another rye just to make the conversation flow 
 And then well have another rye and well play a little gin 
 Well have another rye and well tune some music in 
 And then well have another gin and well play a little rye 
 And well suddenly realize that were getting kind of high 
 And so well turn the lights down low to keep the bulbs from getting hot 
 And well play a little game called  YesNo  
 Why not 
 But tonight I think Im gonna find me something swell 
 So I can wake up in the morning miserable as hell 
 Now when butter costs a dollar bread costs more than cake 
 Come back soon cause babe think of what a gal like you could make 
 Yes come back baby baby baby  dont ever say that were through 
 Cause this time pretty baby Id like to walk right out on youIts a wonderful night and the music is right 
 Will you dance with me and hold me tight 
 I dont know why I feel this way 
 Its how I feel when they start to play 
 That old song we heard so long ago 
 That I wonder if I can remember every word 
 Its amazing how fast years have gone past 
 And that some kinds of love just dont seem to last 
 But win or loose I love you still 
 Its you I choose and I always will 
 And that old song we heard so long ago 
 Still reminds me of the girl I used to know 
 But thats all in a dream thats been over for years 
 Now things are what they seem only minus the tears 
 So I think of you now the way you were then 
 And Ill manage somehow to keep trying again 
 But I dont mind if you dont write 
 Cause I recall that magic night 
 Was more beautiful than the love we used to share 
 Yes that old song we heard so long ago 
 Yes that old song Take a look at this little girl Prettiest in this little world 
 Got a little twist and curl 
 And she calls me DaddyO And she calls me DaddyO 
 Take a look at this little smile Cutest one Ive seen in a while 
 Got a lot of class and style 
 Oh oh oh got a funny feelin Oh oh oh its my heart shes stealin 
 Oh oh oh she is so appealin 
 When she calls me DaddyO When she calls me DaddyO 
 She can make the Earth stand still She can reach the window sill 
 She can give my heart a thrill 
 Take a look at silk and lace Take a look at this little face 
 When shes in her dads embrace 
 Oh oh oh Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh Oh oh ohEveryday 
 Its getting closer going faster 
 Than a rollercoaster 
 Love like yours 
 Will surely come my way 
 Ahey ahey hey 
 Everyday 
 Its getting faster 
 Everyone said 
 Go on and ask her 
 Love like yours will surely come my way 
 Seems a little longer 
 Everyway 
 Loves a little stronger 
 Come with me 
 Do you ever long for true love from me 
 Will surely come my wayStandin on a trap door theres a hole in the ground 
 Underneath the door theres a hole and it goes to infinity 
 Standin on a dark street theres a light in the sky 
 Followin the light through the night as it goes to infinity 
 How can I avoid infinity How have I annoyed infinity 
 Im movin slow in infinity I even glow in infinity 
 Its hard being small hard bein small 
 Shrinkin into space shrinkin into space 
 The world is just a ball world is just a ball 
 It was my favorite place it was my favorites place 
 Lookin for the blue skies watchin for the sunrise 
 One thing you can bet you wont see it set in infinity 
 Gonna take a light beam on the wings of the Jet Stream 
 Gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity 
 How can I be friends with infinity Can I make ammends with infinity 
 How can I complain to infinity Whatll I explain to infinity 
 Give me just a time shield before the world has its fate sealed 
 Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity 
 I hope I can contribute oh but I dont want a tribute 
 Hypocrites will come and say somethin really dumb in infinity 
 I cant hear you sing in infinity I cant change a thing in infinity 
 The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity 
 It was my favorite place it was my favorites placeJust walk on out the door its all over 
 Forgivin you is just a waste of time 
 I dont believe that Ill live to regret it 
 Youre ancient history to this heart of mine 
 So many times Ive heard the same old stories 
 Why any fool can learn to read between the lines 
 But this time honey youve burned all your bridges 
 Well Ive marked you down as just another lonely page 
 In the book of heartaches that you leave behind 
 Cause Ive found out Im better off without you 
 Youre ancient history to this heart of mineIm walkin away and leavin you standin 
 Ive nothing to say for Ive said it all the best way I know how 
 Cry cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you 
 Cause thats the wrong thing to do 
 Does it ease you to know that Ive thought about stayin 
 Yet I think I will go and let the words of goodbye go unsaid 
 Speak speak if you need to but I cant stay to hear you 
 All the words that you whisper are words that have nothing to say 
 And the thoughts they reveal are the reasons Im goin away 
 From the touch of your voice I can feel separation 
 So you leave me no choice for to remain would mean living apart 
 Touch touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you 
 Thats the wrong thing to do 
 Thats the wrong thing to doWonderful baby livin on love the 
 Sandman says maybe hell take you above 
 Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows where babies float by just 
 Counting their toes 
 Wonderful baby nothin but new the 
 World has gone crazy Im glad Im not you 
 At the beginning or is it the end It goes 
 In and comes out and starts over again 
 Wonderful baby livin on love the

 I knew the future youd be first to know But I dont know nothin of what

 Theyll whisper sweet things to make untrue So be good to yourself thats all 
 You can do Youre a wonderful baby livin on love the sandman says maybe hell 
 Take you above up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows where babies float 
 By just counting their toes where 
 Babies float by just counting their toesWell this is life this is Prime time 
 This is livin in the U S A 
 Well this is life this is Prime Time 
 This is livin the American way 
 I was ridin on the subway in the afternoon 
 I saw some kids a beatin out a funky tune 
 The lady right in front of me was old and brown 
 The kids began to push her they knocked her down 
 I tried to help her out but there was just no way 
 A life aint worth a damn on the street today 
 I passed the ambulance and the camera crews 
 I saw the instant replay on the evening news 
 Well this is life this is Prime time 
 Well will you take the car or will you take the trip 
 Remove annoying hair from your upper lip 
 Whats it really worth Does she really care 
 Whats the best shampoo that I can use on my hair 
 Hey whats the real future of democracy 
 Howre we gonna streamline the bureaucracy 
 Hey hey the cost of life has gone skyhigh 
 Does the deodorant Im using really keep me dry 
 Well spin the magic wheel and try to break the bank 
 Think about your life when you fill in the blank 
 Heres a game thats real if you wanna try 
 One spot on the wheel that says you must die 
 American roulette is the game we play 
 But noone wants to have to be the one to pay 
 You get to pass GO you get to pass away 
 But before we start our show heres our sponsor to say 
 Well this is life this is Prime time 
 This is livin the American way 
 Well down in Mexico the laundrys on the line 
 Theres where you can go if you land on the nine 
 Canada is nice if youre fond of ice 
 If you land on the two then well send you there twice 
 We interrupt this game for a news release 
 A man has gone insane and been killed by police 
 Now back to the game thats a dangerous play 
 Cause if they see you in CUBA you must pass away 
 My suppers on the stove the war is on the screen 
 Pass the bread and butter while I watch the Marine 
 The shot him in the chestPass the chicken breast 
 The general is saying that hes still unimpressed 
 We had to burn the city cause they wouldnt agree 
 That things go better with democracy 
 The weather will be fair forget the ozone layer 
 But strontium showers will be here and there 
 Well livin in the country watchin shadows fall 
 My reception aint too good in a power stall 
 Bombers in the air missiles in the sea 
 Chemicals in everything including me 
 They dont keep their promise in the promised land 
 Its getting mighty hard to find an honest man 
 But coming very soon a show youll die to see 
 Its called The End Of The World on channel C 
 This is livin the American wayMornin Mrs Campbell 
 Lovely day today 
 I heard about the fire 
 I wonder what the papers say 
 Lets see now 
 Give me fifty shotgun shells 
 And a hundred feet of rope 
 Just add that to my bill 
 Says here there aint no hope 
 They all were burned alive 
 And four packs of cigarettes 
 No I think Ill make it five 
 I heard about the wedding 
 Im so happy for the bride 
 Why that fire house looked mighty nice 
 And the whole town swelled with pride 
 Weve watched her grow to womanhood 
 Shes found an upright man 
 Shell learn this life aint easy 
 You do the best you can 
 No no my family aint so good 
 My wife just had a spell 
 And I cant afford the medicine 
 She needs to make her well 
 Ive been laid off at that factory 
 For sixteen months or more 
 I came home last Wednesday evenin 
 I found her lyin on the floor 
 Bye now Mrs Campbell 
 Say howdy to your son 
 You can tell him well go huntin 
 When he gets a bigger gun 
 It was too bad about that fire 
 But dont you get me wrong 
 Weve gotta teach these people 
 How to stay where they belongLove letters straight from your heart 
 Keep us so near while apart 
 Im not alone in the night 
 When I can have all the love you write 
 I memorize evry line 
 I kiss the name that you sign 
 And darlin then I read again right from the start 
 Love letters straight from your heartIf you wanna make me happy 
 Heres all you gotta do 
 Just take me where youre going 
 And Ill take care of you 
 Cause Ive got this need thats growin 
 To keep you satisfied 
 And if you keep your green light showin 
 Then you can take me for a ride 
 Cause I la la la la la la love you 
 And I la la la la la la care 
 And I really want you with me baby everywhere 
 Well I like the way youre movin 
 And I like the way you go 
 Well I like the way you let your 
 Locomotion show 
 Cause my drivin wheel is drivin 
 And my pistons are workin good 
 And if your motor gives you some trouble baby 
 Ill take a look underneath your hood 
 Well I know you like your transportation 
 With a motor and a rubber wheel 
 But when you move you cause a transformation 
 In this lover and the way I feel 
 So if you wanna make me happy 
 Just let me ride your box car 
 And Ill hobo with you 
 Cause all I got is on my shoulders 
 Im walkin on my travellin shoes 
 And before I get much older 
 Im gonna kick these lovesick blues 
 And I la la la la la la love you 
 And I really want you with me baby everywhereI was all right for a while 
 I could smile for a while 
 But when I saw you last night 
 You held my hand so tight 
 When you stopped to say hello 
 And though you wished to me well 
 You couldnt tell 
 That Id been 
 Crying over you 
 Then you said so long 
 Left me standing all alone 
 Alone and crying 
 Crying 
 Its hard to understand 
 That the touch of your hand 
 Can start me crying 
 I thought that I was over you 
 But its true so true 
 I love you even more than I did before 
 But darling what can I do 
 While you dont love me 
 And Ill always be 
 Yes now youre gone 
 And from this moment on 
 Ill be crying 
 Crying 
 Crying over you

 But Narcisissma gives me peace of mind

 Pomona says she looks like me 
 But she will look like you when Im set freeWhat can this be can you tell me 
 Would you like to discover why were not free 
 To be lovers 
 Ive been wanting to ask you 
 Where has all the love gone 
 And what have we become 
 Storm clouds full of thunder 
 Move silent as they drum 
 And when theyre gone 
 Well be fine till tomorrow 
 Though I hope it wont rain 
 You will be mine 
 And my sorrow 
 Will take wings in the morning 
 High above the heavens 
 A rainbow paints the sky 
 White doves sing their songs of love 
 I watch them as they fly 
 And wonder what can this be 
 Can you tell me 
 To be loversDont worry bout me its all over now 
 Though I may be blue Ill manage somehow 
 Love cant be explained cant be controlled 
 One day its warm next day its cold 
 Dont pity me cause Im feeling blue 
 Dont be ashamed it might happen to you 
 Oh oh oh oh oh love kiss me 
 One time then go love Ill understand 
 Dont worry bout me 
 Sweet sweet sweet love will I want you to be 
 As happy as I when you love me 
 Ill never forget you your sweet memory its all over now Dont worry bout me 
 When one heart tells one heart one heart goodbye 
 One heart is free one heart will cry 
 Oh oh oh oh oh sweet sweet baby sweet baby sweet 
 Its all right dont worry bout meWell Ive been left for dead on the road of love 
 I was doin high speed with a load of love 
 Forgot the first creed in the code of love 
 Alls fair in love and war 
 Well Im an honest man and I try to be true 
 I did unto her like Ill do unto you 
 Now you prefer to tell me were through 
 Im bleedin through my shirt and tie 
 Im bleedin and Ill tell you why 
 Well Ive been left for dead on the road of love 
 Well now who is the guy and when did he come 
 When did he start to go beatin your drum 
 Well hes hittin on you Im feelin numb 
 And she dont believe a word I told her 
 Im cryin on a gravel shoulder 
 Watch what youre doin 
 Look where youre goin 
 Give me a signal 
 Some way of knowin 
 Well now whos at the wheel in the life that drove by 
 I could swear it was her made me shift into high 
 Shes got those dangerous curves 
 And theyre wrackin my nerves 
 She always wiggles and swerves 
 Shes gonna give her driver everything he deserves 
 Well now who could want this to lie here alone 
 With a palate of bricks a pillow of stone 
 Well to think that one kiss pulled me out o my zone 
 And I wonder whats the change inside her 
 This road has got a long divider 
 Alls fair in love and warIm in love 
 Im in love 
 Im in love with a girl 
 Thats whats the matter with me 
 Im in love with a beautiful girl 
 But she dont give a darn about me 
 To make her love me I tried 
 How I sighed and I cried 
 But she just refused 
 And ever since shes gone away 
 Ive got those lovesick blues 
 Got the feeling called the blue hoos 
 Since my sweetie said Good Bye 
 Seems I dont know what to Do Hoo 
 All day long I sit and cry 
 That last long day we spent alone 
 Im yearning for it yet 
 She thrilled me filled me 
 With a kind of lovin 
 I never will forget the way she called me sweet daddy 
 Twas just a beautiful dream 
 I hate to think that its all over I lost my heart it seems 
 I got so used to her somehow 
 But Im no bodys baby 
 Now gee its awful when youre lonesome 
 And get those lovesick blueoohoohoohoohs 
 I never will forget the way she called me sweet daddy 
 And get those lovesick blueoohoohoohoohsOh Mary this Londons a wonderful sight 
 Dont be startin them fashions now Mary McRee 
 Beautiful shapes Nature never designed 
 To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the seaI need headroom 
 Got to have headroom 
 Some place to rest my head 
 Im gettin taller 
 Thinkins gettin smaller 
 Time is winnin out instead 
 Well I heard it on the news 
 Theyre selling everything they can 
 And the American flag 
 Is manufactured in Japan 
 Theyre fightin battles in the stars 
 Theyre pourin billions into Mars 
 And layin right there at my feet 
 Therere people sleepin in the street 
 Give me room room room room room room 
 Well Im livin on the farm 
 Where chemistry has lost its charm 
 And every dusty wind that blows 
 Is burnin big holes in my clothes 
 Theyre burnin big holes in the sky 
 Makin people wonder why 
 With all our land and sea and space 
 Progress is wreckin every place 
 Well if you want an assenell 
 The government will wish you well 
 And if you steal a million bucks 
 The government will wish you luck 
 And they might even give you more 
 If youre makin things for war 
 But if youre poor and stealin cars 
 Youll spend your life behind the bars 
 Theyre talkin ethics on the hill 
 Theyre talkin union at the mill 
 Theyre talkin justice at the farm 
 Theyre talkin safety in the car 
 Theyre talkin murder in the states 
 Theyre talkin cash to get a fix 
 Theyre talkin virus in the bed 
 Im talkin room to rest my head 
 I need headroom 
 Some place to rest my headIm always lighthearted and easy 
 Not a care in this world have I 
 Because I am loved by an Ollie 
 And I couldnt forget if I try 
 She lives far away oer the mountains 
 Where the little birds sing on the trees 
 And the cabins all covered with ivy 
 And the Ollie is waiting for me 
 The day I said goodbye to Allie 
 Is a day I will never forget 
 For the tears bubbled up from their slumber 
 I fancy I see them yet 
 They looked like the pearls in the ocean 
 As she wept her tale of love 
 And she said my dear boy dont forget me 
 Till we meet here again or abovePretty paper pretty ribbons of blue 
 Wrap your presents to your darling so true 
 Pretty pencils to write I love you 
 Pretty paper pretty ribbons of blue 
 Crowded street busy feet hustle by him 
 Downtown shoppers Christmas is nigh 
 There he sits all alone on the sidewalk 
 Hoping you wont pass him by 
 Should you stop You better not youre much too busy 
 Youre in a hurry how time does fly 
 And in the distance the ringing of laughter 
 And in the midst of the laughter he cries 
 Pretty paper pretty ribbons of blueIf I could say the things I feel it wouldnt be the same 
 Some things are not spoken of some things have no name 
 And though the words come hard to me Ill say them just for you 
 For this is something rare for me this feeling is so new 
 You see I love the way you love me 
 Love the way you smile at me 
 I love the way we live this life were in 
 Long ago I heard the song that lovers sing to me 
 And through the days with each new phrase I hummed that melody 
 And all along I loved the song but I never learned it through 
 But since the day you came along Ive saved it just for you 
 Love the way you smile at me 
 I dont believe in magic but I do believe in you 
 And when you say you believe in me 
 Theres so much magic I can do 
 Now you see me now you dont watch me dive below 
 Deep down in your love lake where the sweet fish come and go 
 And I might sink and I might drown but death dont mean a thing 
 Cause life continues right or wrong when I play this 
 Birthday song 
 I learned from you 
 And you cant even singOld man rhythm is in my shoes 
 No use tsittin and asingin the blues 
 So be my guest you got nothin to lose 
 Wont ya let me take you on a sea cruise 
 Oohee oohee baby 
 Feel like jumpin baby wont ya join me please 
 I dont like beggin but Im on bended knee 
 I got to get trockin get my hat off the rack 
 I got to boogie woogie like a knife in the back 
 I got to get tmovin baby I aint lyin 
 My heart is beatin rhythm and its right on time 
 Wont ya let me take you on a sea cruiseIts a sunshine life for me 
 If I could get away from this cloud over me 
 Seems to just follow me around 
 Its a sunshine life for me 
 Theres a good life had for free 
 When youre out in the country 
 Thats what I could use if I could get away there soon 
 Theres a good life had at sea 
 If youre not in the Navy 
 Thats the life for you sail away Raymond sail away 
 Now most folks just bore me 
 Always imposing and Id rather meet a tree 
 Somewhere out in the cornfield 
 And its a sunshine 
 Seems to just follow me 
 Its a sunshine 
 Its a sunshineI walk down to the sea 
 And I saw this crazy man 
 He was looking at me 
 And he said I have a plan 
 Yes he said I have a plan 
 He was black from the sun 
 And his eyes were in tears 
 And his hand was so thick 
 From the work of the years 
 Yes his hand was so thick 
 He said Please come with me 
 To my home by the sea 
 We can smoke drink and eat 
 And youll sit at my feet 
 And Ill tell what I know 
 While the sea breezes blow 
 For Ive tried to be free 
 But Ill soon have to go 
 And his house was his art 
 And nature his wish 
 It was sculpted from clay 
 In the shape of a fish 
 In the shape for a fish 
 And the caves in the back 
 Had been arched into stone 
 And the creatures he kept 
 Made him far from alone 
 Yes the creatures he kept 
 I have only one son 
 In Chicago for life 
 He is separate from me 
 And so is my wife 
 And I live in the sun 
 And I hate what theyve done 
 To my beautiful sea 
 And what theyll do to me 
 And we walked from the house 
 For miles by the shore 
 And we picked up the trash 
 That theyd left by his door 
 Yes we picked up the trash 
 And the oil and the sludge 
 Got stuck to my feet 
 And the fish that were dead 
 Were too poisoned to eat 
 Yes the fish that were dead 
 And the blade cut his hand 
 And its stiff from the scar 
 And the butchers called doctors 
 Leave you worse than you are 
 And were all like the butchers 
 We cut into life 
 And we like to see blood 
 On the end of our knife 
 And someday they will come 
 And bulldoze him down 
 For he has not a permit 
 From the kings of the town 
 No he has not a permit 
 And the doctors will come 
 And say hes afraid 
 And theyll ruin this man 
 And destroy what he made 
 And the pictures he kept 
 Will be torn from his hand 
 With the beautiful house 
 That he built on the sandJust asittin in the balcony 
 Just awatchin a movie 
 Or maybe its a symphony 
 I wouldnt know 
 Dont care about the symphonies 
 Those cymbales and tympanies 
 Just asittin in the balcony 
 On the very last row 
 I hold your hand and I kiss you too 
 The features over but were not through 
 Mmmm just asittin in the balcony 
 Holdin hands in the balcony 
 We may stop lovin to watch Bugs Bunny 
 But he cant take the place of my honey 
 Just asnootchin in the balcony 
 Just ahuggin and akissin 
 With my baby in the very last rowWhen a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world 
 Its the end of a world that you had with a girl 
 Though its hard to admit that the memorys sad 
 When you think what you had when a good thing goes badÂ 
 Love is so strange its a mystery to me 
 Its easy to change and to lose what could be 
 So you wait and you watch for the one wholl agree 
 With the things that you need and the life that you lead 
 When a good thing goes right its a joy beyond worth 
 As the roots of your love intertwine with the earth 
 And your bodies are one but youre living for two 
 And your future looks bright oh yes when a good thing goes right 
 But time is the test like the sea pounds the rocks 
 And those who love best sometimes fail with the shocks 
 And the waves break you down and you watch your love drown 
 And shes so far from reach as you stand on the beach 
 When a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world 
 When you think what you had when a good thing goes badHere I am back home again 
 Im here to rest 
 All they ask is where Ive been 
 Knowing Ive been West 
 Im the familys unowned boy 
 Golden curls of envied hair 
 Pretty girls with faces fair 
 See the shine in the Black Sheep Boy 
 If you love me let me live in peace 
 Please understand 
 That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece 
 And hold a winning hand 
 So if you love me let me live in peace 
 See the shine in the Black Sheep BoyJerusalem Jerusalem all roads lead to you 
 Jerusalem Jerusalem your light is shining through 
 And you will show show the way to all who see it shine 
 That we can live in peace in Jerusalem this time 
 The walls will keep you in the walls will keep you out 
 The gates are calling those who know what its about 
 Jerusalem Jerusalem all roads lead to you 
 And you will show you will show show the way show the way to all who see it shine 
 Jerusalem is old Jerusalem is new 
 Jerusalem can hold Moslem Christian Jew 
 In Jerusalem Jerusalem all roads lead to you 
 The markets and the alleys the temples and the tombs 
 A place for all believers it has so many rooms 
 Yes we can live in peace in Jerusalem this timeIn someones hand there is a land where I must surely go where she is 
 To learn what she must know when she gives all her love away 
 To him that seems as in her dreams unbroken by the storm on the sea 
 But quiet deep and warm ever free to give his love away 
 And when these two have found the land the world is not the same 
 For though it spins when love begins the world is not the same 
 This is one change I always have longed for 
 I always belonged more to you than to anyone 
 And in your hand the stars the sand the rain and wind are new as we live 
 And learn what love can do when we give all our love away 
 And now we too have found the land the world is not the same 
 For though it spins when love begins the world is not the sameEvery night I hope and pray 
 A dream lover will come my way 
 A girl to hold in my arms 
 And know the magic of her charms 
 Cause I want 
 A girl 
 To call 
 My own 
 I want a dream lover 
 So I dont have to dream alone 
 Dream lover where are you 
 With a love oh so true 
 And the hand that I can hold 
 To feel you near as I grow old 
 Someday I dont know how 
 I hope shell hear my plea 
 Some way I dont know how 
 Shell bring her love to me 
 Dream lover until then 
 Ill go to sleep and dream again 
 Thats the only thing to do 
 Till all my lovers dreams come true 
 Please dont make me dream alone 
 I beg you dont make me dream alone 
 No I dont wanna dreamWhy do I do just as you say 
 Why must I just give you your way 
 Why do I sigh 
 Why do I try to forget 
 It must have been that something lovers call Fate 
 Kept on saying I had to wait 
 I saw them all 
 Just couldnt fall till we met 
 It had to be you it had to be you 
 I wandered around and finally found the somebody who 
 Could make me be true could make me be blue 
 And even be glad just to be sad thinkin of you 
 Some others Ive seen might never be mean 
 Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldnt do 
 For nobody else gave me a thrill 
 With all your faults I love you still 
 It had to be you wonderful you it had to be youI got a color TV for a limited time 
 And you can have it by tonight itll bend your mind 
 I wouldnt just sell it to an ordinary fool 
 Y have to be sure that the fool has cool 
 Since you look like a man with heart and soul 
 If you buy it from me now you get a free mixing bowl 
 Ill even let you have a little button I got 
 That says have a nice day youre gonna like it a lot 
 Popular music is the national craze 
 Rock and Roll stars have the kids in a daze 
 But twist the knob around for a different point of view 
 And youll twist that knob till it comes unscrewed 
 Theres only one song that the TV sings and thats 
 Pennies From Heaven while the register rings 
 So its easy to see right from the start 
 That what makes good money makes good art 
 Now did you read the encyclical thats written by the Pope 
 Sayin folks with private property just got no hope 
 The rich aint welcome in the heavenly Palladium 
 But the Knights of Columbus own Yankee Stadium 
 Now I aint sayin that the Pope was wrong 
 But he can easily afford to sing that song 
 If youd like to call him up when you need some dough 
 His numbers Et Cum Spiri 2 2 0 
 The kids that fought the war are livin outa state 
 And the CIA is runnin things of late 
 When we elect a man we put him on the spot 
 Cause if he dont play ball he might get shot 
 The national security keeps it from the voters 
 Cause whats good for America isnt good for General Motors 
 We went and found ourselves some mighty strange lovers 
 The kind that like to blow from underneath the covers 
 Well millions can avoid with Dr Sigmund Freud 
 Those realities of life that tend to make me paranoid 
 Lookin for the answer just gives me indigestion 
 I spent so much time just dealin with the question 
 Wed rather talk of dollars and forget about events 
 When what we have to decide is Does it all make sense 
 Well everybodys happy I saw it on the news 
 But me I got a case of color TV blues 
 You know just cause youre paranoid 
 Doesnt mean theyre not trying t get yaThe angels are lost in the city of stars 
 The wise men are down on their knees 
 And the fruitman of freeway will sell you his cars 
 When hes sure that you cant find the keys 
 And the ladies on Magdalene lane 
 All worship the sun and the sand 
 And the migrants who come cant complain 
 For this is their promised land 
 MGM studios cant make the nut 
 Theyre auctioning Dorothys shoes 
 Gable is gone the Good Witch is a slut 
 And Ive got the parking lot blues 
 The wizard brought Benzedrine smiles 
 And he never let Dorothy doze 
 She died as she walked down the aisle 
 And all that remains is her clothes 
 Over the rainbow a Kansas tornado 
 Can twist up a little girls head 
 Aunt Ems on relief and the Tinmans a thief 
 And even The Wizard cant wake the dead 
 The prophet has come to the kingdom of lights 
 But theres no one to listen or learn 
 And the savior performs for the prophets delight 
 While dissenters are banished or burned 
 And the heretics beg to be heard 
 But the saviors on tour for the week 
 Salvation is found in his word 
 If only hed learn how to speak 
 And Lincoln is laughing with Amos n Andy 
 Concerning the Great Civil War 
 And Paul Revere sleeps with the worst looking creeps 
 While revolutions knockin at his door 
 Magdalene Lane is the red light domain 
 Where everyones soul is for sale 
 A piece of your heart will do for a start 
 And you can send us the rest in the mail 
 For we have our own families to feed 
 And we cant let them starve just for you 
 But wed rather not watch while you bleed 
 So come back in an hour when youre through 
 Its just another city full of sorrow 
 Makes no difference why I came 
 And I only know Im leaving here tomorrow 
 And only the motel man knows my nameDid you know that love can grow any place where people go 
 And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me 
 The sun is high the day is new and 
 I have found a place with you 
 Evry place and evry face casts a spell and leaves a trace 
 With you in mind and with you near the myth is gone the past is clear 
 And here with scars of now and then so you and I begin again 
 Did you know Ive been searchin Did you know Ive been blind 
 Did you know Ive been touchin anything I could find 
 Did you know that here below moving where my feelings flow 
 You live with me in time thats new suspended in a love thats true 
 And far beyond the fatal noise and bathed in all lifes simple joys 
 Did you know that love can grow any place where people go 
 And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with meI wish my brain would operate instead of standing still its all so complicated 
 The thread of my own thoughts is disappearing to what seems to be a logical conclusion I guess Ive run out of ideas 
 Ive heard a million songs about this and that and it gave me satisfaction 
 But I see its a beautiful life 
 Now comes the second verse and I have to at least keep the measure straight 
 Its been a long time and Im really insecure about it all I guess I didnt like seeing the things I saw 
 Who needs it 
 Its been a little painful and I hope I dont like pain cause Id hate to think of myself like that 
 Cause I see its a beautiful life 
 How did I ever let some of those ideas out of the box 
 It was just a feeling I had and I liked the verses they were so nice and even 
 My eye will never be that good again 
 I lost a certain sense of rhythm but I gained a certain sense of time 
 I like the old things but I cant give up the idea of trying something just a little bit different even if its stupid 
 Yes I see its a beautiful life 
 And I see its a beautiful lifeToyland toyland 
 Little girl and boy land 
 When you dwell within it 
 You are ever happy there 
 Childhood toyland 
 Mystical merry toyland 
 Once you pass its borders 
 You can never return again not again 
 Childhood toyland Toyland 
 You can never return again 
 Toyland Toyland Toyland Toyland 
 Toyland ToylandThe lonesome sound of a train going by 
 I recall the day it took you away 
 Well when I hear that whistle blow 
 I want to pack my suitcase and go 
 The lonesome sound of a train going by 
 In the still of night in the pale moonlight 
 The wind it moans and sighs 
 These awfelt blues I just cant lose 
 Well when I hear that lonesome whistle blow 
 Im blue Im lonesome tooStarry starry night 
 Paint your palette blue and gray 
 Look out on a summers day 
 With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
 Shadows on the hills 
 Sketch the trees and the daffodils 
 Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
 In colors on the snowy linen land 
 Now I understand 
 What you tried to say to me 
 And how you suffered for your sanity 
 And how you tried to set them free 
 They would not listen they did not know how 
 Perhaps theyll listen now 
 Starry starry night 
 Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
 Swirling clouds in violet haze 
 Reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue 
 Colors changing hue 
 Morning fields of amber grain 
 Weathered faces lined in pain 
 Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand 
 For they could not love you 
 But still your love was true 
 And when no hope was left in sight 
 On that starry starry night 
 You took your life as lovers often do 
 But I couldve told you Vincent 
 This world was never meant for 
 One as beautiful as you 
 Portraits hung in empty halls 
 Frameless heads on nameless walls 
 With eyes that watch the world and cant forget 
 Like the strangers that youve met 
 The ragged men in ragged clothes 
 The silver thorn of bloody rose 
 Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 
 Now I think I know 
 They would not listen theyre not listening still 
 Perhaps they never willIf you want to make me happy here is all you gotta do 
 And if your motor gives you some trouble baby 
 Ill take a look underneath your hood yes I would 
 Cause II dont have plans and schemes and I dont have hopes and dreams 
 I dont have anything since I dont have you 
 I dont have fond desires I dont have happy hours 
 I dont have happiness and I guess I never will again 
 When you walked out on me in came old misery 
 And hes been here since then 
 Now I dont have love to share and I dont have one who cares 
 I dont have anything since I dont have  
 You you you you youTimber timber timber 
 Timber timber timber 
 Oh the mountains high down the canyons wide 
 Let me roam and ride ride through timber 
 When the day is done by the campfires gleam 
 Let me lie and dream dream of timber 
 Tall timbers callin and the echoes ring 
 All nature sings a song along the timber trail 
 Blue shadows fallin down the canyons vale 
 And the whispering pines entwine along the timber trail 
 High in the sky above 
 The love song of the trees 
 Will blend and wend its way 
 Out on the breeze 
 All nature sings a song along the timber trail 
 The timber trail timber timber 
 Timber timber timber timberIt started out quite simply as complex things can do 
 A set of sad transparencies till no one could see through 
 But least of all the one inside behind the iron glass 
 A prisonor of all your dreams that never come to pass 
 Alone you stand corrupted by the vision that you sought 
 And blinded by your hunger all your apetites are bought 
 But in spite of what becomes of you your image will remain 
 A reminder of your constant loss a symbol of your gain 
 And your friends are together 
 Where the people are all gathered 
 All along the road you travelled all your days 
 And soon you have succumbed to what the others all believe 
 And though the lie affects them still its you that they deceive 
 And all at once youre lost within the emptieness of you 
 And theres no one left whos near enough to tell you what to do 
 Youre left with nothing but your selfpotential in the dark 
 Like tinder resting on a rock protected from the spark 
 But your fire just consumes you you alone can feel the pain 
 And you stand in all your glory and you know you cant complain 
 But you are surely just as evil as the worst my tongue can tell 
 For youll never face my heaven and Ill not endure your hell 
 You have lost your chance to mingle with your constant quiet lies 
 Deceptions hidden with your lips but spoken with your eyes 
 For I know you for what you are not for thats really all you are 
 And your talents of a minor order seem to stretch too far 
 And we both know that this masquerade cant carry on too long 
 Youre deep inside the Pride Parade but where do you belong 
 All along the road you travelled all your daysLove me oh love me 
 Love me like nobody else can do 
 Need me 
 And just let me go one needing you 
 Well if you want to try to make me over 
 And theres something else that fits your plan 
 Its all right if you would only tell me 
 What its going to take to be your man 
 If you ever say youre going to leave me 
 Lord I dont know what on earth Ill do 
 I could never face a new tomorrow 
 If I had to face it without you 
 And just let me go on needing youAs the seasons go circlin and the years spin away 
 And the highway grows narrow at the end of the day 
 Theres a promise I made you on the first day of spring 
 To have and to hold this gold wedding ring 
 To have and to hold till death do us part 
 In sickness or health with all the love in my heart 
 For richer for poorer till we both have grown old 
 Through all of lifes seasons to have and to hold 
 And if we can have children or live all alone 
 The light of our love will forever be shown 
 Our union is timeless our love beyond worth 
 To have and to hold till the ends of the earth 
 Through all of lifes seasons to have and to holdIt came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old 
 From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold 
 Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heavn all gracious King 
 The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing 
 For lo the days are hastning on by prophets seen of old 
 When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold 
 When the new heavn and earth shall on the Prince of peace their king 
 And the whole world send back the song which now the angels singIm building my body 
 Im happy when Im building my body 
 Im tired of fighting lets make friends 
 Im tired of burning both ends 
 Thats why Im building my body 
 It hurts me but Im building my body 
 And I know what the pain is worth 
 I know I feel the pain of birth 
 Im pushin up 
 And gettin down with my body 
 Theres noone else around with my body 
 One look says Im a stone disgrace 
 Dont kick no sand in my face 
 Because Im building my body strong 
 Im watching what I eat 
 And Im sorting out right from wrong 
 Hey not a lot of meat 
 And I know that it wont be long 
 Before I gotta quit smoking 
 Because Im building my body 
 Im peaceful when Im building my body 
 Im sweating out mistakes Ive made 
 Im getting back the dues Ive paid 
 Im doing more 
 And getting sore with my body 
 But Im gaining a rapport with my body 
 And this seems like the perfect time 
 They say Im in my prime 
 Thats why Im building my body strong 
 Im thinking at the table 
 Im reading every label 
 Cause Im building my body 
 Theres someone else inside of my body 
 Hes waiting to be born againThe winter season of the year 
 When to this world our Lord was born 
 The ox and donkey so they say 
 Did keep his holy presence warm 
 How many oxen and donkeys now 
 If they were there when first he came 
 How many oxen and donkeys you know 
 At such a time would do the same 
 And on that night it has been told 
 These humble beasts so rough and rude 
 Throughout the noght of holy birth 
 Drank no water ate no food 
 As soon as to these humble beasts 
 Appeared our Lord so mild and sweet 
 With joy they knelt before his Grace 
 And gently kissed His tiny feet 
 Dressed in ermine silk and such 
 At such a time would do as muchYou took me up to Heaven 
 When you took me in your arms 
 I was dazzled by your beauty 
 Blinded by your charms 
 I was lost in a fools paradise 
 Good and lost in a fools paradise 
 Now when you told me that you loved me 
 Well then I gave my heart to you 
 Oh well I wonder if there could be 
 Any truth in love so new 
 The whole world was my kingdom 
 And your love the gem in my crown 
 But when I saw you glance at a new romance 
 You know my love came tumbling down 
 Well you treat me kinda coolish 
 And you never let me know 
 That you think Im being foolish 
 And because I love you so 
 I still get lost in a fools paradise 
 Well the whole world was my kingdom 
 You know you treat me kinda coolish 
 Because I love you so 
 Lost with you in a fools paradise 
 Yes I still get lost in a fools paradise 
 So goddarn lost in a fools paradiseOn the first floor 
 On the first floor 
 She screams for help but no ones there 
 Then rings no more 
 A silent saddened lady thinks of what its like to die 
 But the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up 
 She never calls or comes around 
 Separate us from each others feelingsAnd I love you so 
 The people ask me how 
 How Ive lived till now 
 I tell them I dont know 
 I guess they understand 
 How lonely life has been 
 But life began again 
 The day you took my hand 
 And yes I know how lonely life can be 
 The shadows follow me 
 And the night wont set me free 
 But I dont let the evening get me down 
 Now that youre around me 
 And you love me too 
 Your thoughts are just for me 
 You set my spirit free 
 Im happy that you do 
 The book of life is brief 
 And once a page is read 
 All but love is dead 
 That is my belief 
 And yes I know how loveless life can be 
 But I dont let the evening bring me down 
 I tell them I dont knowI hate fashion I hate it with a passion 
 Are you a fashion victim Are you a fashion victim 
 Are you a fashion victim I bet you are 
 I see them on the video theyre wearin fashion shoes 
 Theyre singin bout their troubles they never paid their dues 
 The rhythms in the background the fashions in the front 
 They tricked us out of music with this latest fashion stunt 
 I hate fashion I hate it with a passion 
 The candidate is handsome hes wearin tailored clothes 
 Hes following the pollster everywhere he goes 
 His teeth have all been straightened his hair is very full 
 His stupidity is hidden by this imagemaking bull 
 School is just a showcase where fashion children go 
 As long as they look cool theres little they should know 
 Ideas have no power when people cannot read 
 Fashion can go sour its not cool to be in need 
 How did the land of Jefferson how did the land of King 
 Become the land of hamburgers and raisins that can sing 
 Roosevelt was cripple Lincoln was a geek 
 Theyd never get elected their clothes were never chic 
 Are you a fashion victim I bet you areIve got nothing on my mind 
 Nothing to remember 
 Nothing to forget 
 And Ive got nothing to regret 
 But Im all tied up on the inside 
 No one knows quite what Ive got 
 And I know that on the outside 
 What I used to be 
 Im not 
 Anymore 
 You know Ive heard about people like me 
 But I never made the connection 
 They walk one road to set them free 
 And find theyve gone the wrong direction 
 But theres no need for turning back 
 Cause all roads lead to where I stand 
 And I believe Ill walk them all 
 No matter what I may have planned 
 Can you remember who I was 
 Can you still feel it 
 Can you find my pain 
 Can you heal it 
 Then lay your hands upon me now 
 And cast this darkness from my soul 
 You alone can light my way 
 You alone can make me whole 
 Once again 
 Weve walked both sides of every street 
 Through all kinds of windy weather 
 But that was never our defeat 
 As long as we could walk together 
 So theres no need for turning back 
 Cause all roads lead to where we stand 
 And I believe well walk them all 
 No matter what we may have planned
