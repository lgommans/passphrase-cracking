Youre such a beautiful freak 
 I wish there were more just like you 
 Youre not like all of the others 
 And that is why I love you 
 Beautiful freak 
 That is why I love you 
 Some people think you have a problem 
 But that problem lies only with them 
 Just cause you are not like the others 
 But that is why I love you 
 Too good for this world 
 But I hope you will stay 
 And Ill be here to see that you dont fade away 
 Youre such a beautiful freak 
 I bet you are flying inside 
 Dart down and then go for cover 
 And know that I I love you 
 You know that I I love you 
 Beautiful freakLittle Bird 
 Hoppinlong my porch 
 I know it sounds kinda sad 
 But whats it all for 
 Right now youre the only friend I have in the world 
 And I just cant take how very much 
 Goddamn 
 I miss that girl 
 Little Bird 
 You look all right 
 Im sure its not easy 
 Getting through your night 
 So tell me this cant be 
 How its gonna end 
 Tell me my heart 
 Somehow 
 Dear God 
 Its gonna mend 
 I guess youre right 
 I cant let it take me out 
 Without a fight 
 Right now I cant see 
 Makin sense of this world 
 I just cant take how very much 
 I miss that girlMy love is always just as she seems 
 A force of nature all her own 
 To be reckoned with 
 Whatevers wrong with me 
 Her kiss redeems 
 And its all there in my dreams 
 In my dreams 
 My love is soaring 
 She glides through the sky 
 Hardly a warning she takes my hand 
 Says 
 Open your eyes 
 We look down on the earth 
 And all its schemes 
 We laugh and its all there in my dreams 
 We swoop down below the clouds 
 Destination unknown 
 And then she says 
 Lets go home 
 My love is resting under a tree 
 She whispers softly in my ear 
 As she lay next to me 
 That was the funnest day 
 Her sad eyes beam 
 In my dreamsNot much of a man 
 But still I am a man 
 And you bring out something inside me 
 A perfect little diamond 
 A fragile little fire 
 Youre everything good in the world 
 To me 
 I want to protect you 
 I want you to be safe and sound 
 At night in this world 
 Such a delicate girl needs someone 
 To look out for the wolves 
 I say some stupid shit 
 Dont mean a word of it 
 You know I got a lot of love inside me 
 This worlds an ugly place 
 For such a pretty face 
 Theyre comin at you from all sides 
 But they gotta get through me 
 Not many understand 
 But im your biggest fan 
 The savage fools cannot appreciate 
 The miracle of you 
 How could it be true 
 Fellas just look at her 
 aw 
 We gotta keep an eye out on her behalf 
 yeahPeople talking sound like dogs 
 Barking through the trees 
 Making no sense at all 
 Meaning nothing to me 
 Mother Mary 
 Quite contrary 
 I did not mean to let you go 
 So quick 
 People talking crack me up 
 They dont have a little clue 
 What its like to be me 
 What its like to lose you 
 I grow weary 
 People talking sound like dogs 
 Barking up the wrong tree 
 Take a good man down 
 And set the evil free 
 So quickShe’s a true original 
 Not some store bought rebel 
 She can find her own way home 
 You just have to let her 
 Whichever path she finds 
 It’s hers to take 
 And if she says she’s fine 
 You just have to wait for her 
 She’s an artist in the world 
 She composes from the heart 
 The finished song is always there 
 Well before she starts 
 And any time she might 
 Get the words wrong 
 You just turn it up and you 
 You sing along with her 
 And if a gun was pointed at her 
 I would stand between the bullet and her 
 And if not being with me is what makes her happy 
 I’d take that bullet too 
 Which ever path she finds 
 I’ll just have to wait for her 
 She’s a true originalAll the little children playin in the yard 
 A sunny day for them nothings really hard 
 But they dont know what its like to wear 
 Shoes so big that people stare 
 All the little children forget my name 
 Theyre all to busy playin their stupid game 
 But they have no clue what it is 
 To be inside of todays showbiz 
 I am a sad clown 
 My smile is upside down 
 No amount of makeup can conceil 
 The pain in my heart that I feel 
 Laughing fools at what I say 
 But know inside theres hell to pay 
 All the little children forget my nameSaw a UFO in the sky last night 
 Makes me wonder if everythings gonna be all right 
 Searching the skyline for a little light 
 All the love in the world inside of you 
 Been there all along to see you through 
 Saw a UFO and it made me cry 
 Could I be so stupid to think that Im 
 Gonna be here forever 
 Saw a UFO then it disappeared 
 Made me wonder if its gonna be back next year 
 Maybe I dont have anything to fear 
 All the love in the world inside of youI write the bsides 
 That make a small portion of the world cry 
 I like the seaside 
 And singing songs that make you not wanna die 
 Throw a stone into the sea 
 And wait for it to come back to me 
 Better get out on the boat 
 Cause someone told me that stones dont float 
 I like to sit out back 
 And look up at the squirrels in the trees 
 They dont like radio tracks 
 And they dont ever talk down to me 
 Throw a nut up in the tree 
 Gonna fall right back on me 
 Well these guys know who they are 
 And what they needs in their own backyard 
 Hoo hoo 
 I like to play in the snow 
 I stick my hand in now where did it go 
 It might be mighty cold 
 But thats all part of not doing what youre toldTheres nothing that I wanna do 
 More than get alone and be with you 
 Trouble with dreams is they dont come true 
 And when they do they cant catch up to you 
 You dont need a thing from me 
 But I I need something big from you 
 Cause you know Ive got 
 An awful lot of big dreams 
 Im walking down a lonely road 
 Clear to me now but I was never told 
 Trouble with dreams is you never know 
 When to hold on and when to let go 
 If you let me down its alright 
 At least that leaves something for me 
 This is the life that I must lead now 
 Crossing fingers and wiping brow 
 Trouble with dreams is you cant pretend 
 Something with no beginning has an end 
 But I need something big from you 
 An awful lot of big dreamsThe kids are screaming and the wife is crying 
 Sunday morning aint no time to find 
 Things are breaking he is rabid he is riven 
 Its very clear that the kids are not alright 
 When grey told me that he didnt like my curtains 
 Just to sad in  not keys 
 He turns some classic rock on the radio 
 And points the speakers right in my face 
 Theres something strange going on over there 
 Somebody should call the cops I swear 
 I dont know whats going on for sure 
 Inside the nightmare next door 
 The walls are shaking with his mannin foot steps 
 Look out for vulcano shes gonna blow 
 The kids are crying out I know that aint please 
 It throws the christmas tree right out the window 
 It starts the day with the hit on the porche and 
 He wakes us up with a hackin  
 He in some night on a basketball court 
 Im tryina sleep you stupid git 
 Somebody should call the cops I swearSundown on the sorry day 
 By night lights the children pray 
 I know youre probably getting ready for bed 
 Beautiful woman get out of my head 
 Im so tired of the same old crud 
 Sweet baby I need fresh blood 
 Ho ow 
 The moon shines in the autumn sky 
 Growing cold as the leaves all die 
 Im more alone than Ive ever been 
 Help me out of the shape Im in 
 After the fires before the flood 
 My sweet baby I need fresh blood 
 Ho howoo 
 Whatever trepidation you may feel 
 In your heart you know its not real 
 In a moment of clarity 
 Summon an act of charity 
 Youve got to pull me out of this mud 
 Ho howooo 
 Ho howoooEverett 
 Millicent dont blame yourself 
 Sweetheart theres no one else more important to me than you 
 Theres nothing that you need to do 
 To prove to me that you care I know you do 
 Millicent just let em talk 
 Cause this thing its a lock and no ones gonna make that untrue 
 Theres nothing anyone can do 
 To change the way I feel about you and you know thats true 
 Millicent just lean on me 
 I know that I can be everything you need me to be 
 Theres no wall that I cant crash through 
 Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you 
 Sweetheart theres no one else in the worldA monk with a hardon and a lavender robe 
 That scratches his thighs through the hat that he strode 
 As he follows a path filled with every desire 
 And mimics his footsteps and sets his prayers on fire 
 Well I too have chosen that which left no choice 
 To sing without loving a solitary voice 
 To observe with passion each careful denial 
 The protrusions which give my life meaning for a while 
 Sometimes I see you in berries and weeds 
 Youre brushing your teeth with liquorice seeds 
 Standing too close pulling your clothes 
 Smiling at God and the meaning of life grows 
 No and Ill never tell and Ill never know 
 What candles you light after the show 
 And Ill never tell and Ill never ask 
 The meaning of life after massScary little suicide bomber 
 On the way to paradise 
 Gonna take yourself and be with her 
 Killin once and killin twice 
 Well its a real hard time 
 Singin the paradise blues 
 Kinda hard to blame somebody 
 For goin to a better place 
 For thinkin theres some kinda magic 
 Up there past outer space 
 Well thats some crazyass shit 
 Im gonna walk these filthy streets 
 Im gonna raise my head 
 I may not be in paradise 
 Woo but Im not dead 
 Aint gonna fly blind 
 Singin these paradise blues 
 Your contempt and your sarcasm 
 Its all so transparent 
 Why dont you give up the act now kid 
 Woo and let some love in 
 Cause thats all that we got 
 Singin these paradise bluesAre you one of the beautiful people 
 Is my name on the list 
 Wanna be of the beautiful people 
 Wanna feel like Im missed 
 Hey you with the walkietalkie 
 I know my clothes are not right 
 I wish I had my own walkietalkie 
 That reached to God every night 
 Everyone needs to be somebody 
 Everyone needs to find someone who cares 
 But I dont know if you know what I mean cause Im 
 Never on your list 
 Are you one of the beautiful people 
 Am I on the wrong track 
 Sometimes it feels like Im made of egg shell 
 And it feels like Im gonna crack 
 Im never on your list 
 Im never on your listThree ghosts and I 
 Sitting on the couch last night 
 Catching up on all the time 
 Its been a while 
 Since we got together 
 And you know that its often on my mind 
 So long ago 
 I left it in the dust 
 Well I was so young and dumb 
 Ran far away 
 But I have to admit 
 Sometimes I miss where Im from 
 Lets have a drink 
 To everything that we went through 
 It wasnt always so bad 
 We cant forget 
 Each others company 
 And all of the good times we had 
 Three ghosts and I 
 Sometimes I miss where Im fromOh man feels so nice 
 That was a long cold night 
 But then the sun came out 
 To thaw the ice 
 Open the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily the merrygold 
 Oh look at her shes got something to say 
 And I cant wait to hear it 
 Wont let her get away 
 Oh yeah oh my goodness 
 You gotta love whats happening here 
 There aint nothing for me to fear 
 Oṗen the window man to smell the peach blossom 
 The tiger lily the merrygoldWell I just heard it the other day 
 My little lady got things she dont say 
 In front of me and Im not to proud 
 She tells her friends my name is walking cloud 
 Well it sounds to me like an Indian name 
 And Im not so sure that I want my fame 
 To hinge on the fact that Im a bad egg 
 She says Im like a big black cloud on legs 
 Well Im not so bad I must defend myself 
 I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf 
 Well its a crazy mixed up life 
 When its hard for man and wife 
 To get along in a crowd 
 When youre walking cloud 
 Well I guess I can be such a bitter old fuck 
 And its true that Ive fallen on some pretty hard luck 
 But I think shes forgetting all the things we vowed 
 Aint it wrong to call your man a walking cloud 
 Cause Im not so bad I must defend myself 
 Well I just heard it the other day 
 She tells her friends my name is walking cloudIn the yard behind the church where 
 Butterflies and blackbirds search for 
 A safe place to rest the night away 
 We will go down to the brook and 
 Sit upon the overlook then 
 Forget about the troubles of the day 
 We will walk among the graves of 
 Men long dead with presidents names and 
 Listen to the water flow softly by 
 I will kiss you on the lips now 
 And as the sky grows dark well strip down 
 And let the water wash away all lies 
 In the yard behind the church where 
 Butterflies and blackbirds perch on 
 Gray stones as the gardens growing dim 
 We will lay down on the ground and 
 Put our cheeks against the dirt down 
 Where it no longer matters where youve beenGuess Im doing something wrong 
 Never feel right in these shoes 
 A pocket full of matches and a head full of flames 
 Got to warn you that Im bad news 
 She tugs me in and then she screams 
 One day you will have to choose 
 Either take care of me or take care of you 
 And dont pretend youre not bad news 
 Come on now Ill take you home 
 You dont have a thing to lose 
 But stick around long enough and youll find out 
 I am nothing but bad news 
 You can never change where youre from 
 No matter who I will accuse 
 Gonna get on with a better life 
 And one day I wont be bad news 
 Its the same every day when I wake up 
 Its the same in the way that you gave me up 
 In the middle of a swan dive 
 And I was soaring down perfect and slowSome folks ride like the wind 
 With the whispering pines to guide them 
 And the burning light inside them 
 Keeps them warm in the snow 
 Others fear the sounds they hear 
 Make banditos out of molehills 
 Fill their hearts with porcupine quills 
 Theyre dead and buried long before they go 
 Charlton Heston movies are no longer in demand 
 His immortal soul my lay forever in the sand 
 The angels wouldnt take him up to heaven like he planned 
 Cause they couldnt pry that gun from his cold dead hand 
 It takes a cold dead hand to decide to pull the trigger 
 It takes a cold dead heart and as near as I can figure 
 With your cold dead aim youre trying to prove your dick is bigger 
 But we know your chariot may not be swinging low 
 Cold dead hand  cold dead hand 
 Youre a big big man with an little bitty gland 
 So you need something bigger just to fill 
 Your cold dead hand 
 Imagine if the lord were here 
 And he knew what youve been thinkin 
 Would his sacred heart be sinkin 
 Into the canyon of dismay 
 And on the ones who sell the guns 
 Hed sick the vultures and coyotes 
 Only the devils true devotees 
 Could profiteer from pain and fear 
 With your cold dead aim youre trying to prove your junk is bigger 
 So you need something bigger with a hairpin trigger 
 You dont want to get caught with your trousers down 
 When the psycho killer comes around 
 So you make your home like a thunderdome 
 And youre always packin everywhere you roam 
 But the psychos win no matter what you do 
 Cause theyre gonna buy way more guns than you 
 And while youre stumbling out of bed 
 They put five rounds in the back of your head 
 Or you get depressed cause the money runs out 
 Then you put your own shotgun in your mouth 
 And your kids walk in and they find you there 
 Like a headless stump in your underwear 
 And they move the gun and it kills them too 
 And your wife just doesnt know what to do 
 But she takes a hand grenade from her shoe 
 And she pulls the pin 
 And its all on you 
 And your cold dead handShut up you dont have to shout it 
 Its fucked up if you think about it too long 
 Feeling like Im all used up 
 Half empty its a broken cup thats all 
 You little fool you could be happy 
 Come take my hand well go for a ride 
 Shut up you dont have to remind me 
 Its not enough to fully blind me from it 
 Feeling like a stupid asshole 
 Take me now if this is it this sucks 
 Look up ahead off in the distance 
 The sun is shining on the bright side 
 The sun is shining on the bright sideTake five take five 
 Not gonna be alright 
 No Im not gonna be alright 
 Nothin is alright now 
 Im not gonna see the sun come up 
 When Im goin down 
 Cause everyday Im here 
 All I feel is sheer agony 
 Friends tellin me that maybe I need 
 Some pychiatric help 
 Yeah theyre always so quick to tell you 
 Just how to get over it 
 But I look into the mirror 
 And all I see is age fear 
 And agony 
 If i could just remember what it was like 
 When I was younger 
 Oh the joy and happiness 
 Replaced with hunger 
 Now all Ive got to show 
 For the seeds that didnt grow 
 Is agonyLook in the mirror I am The Man 
 Mrs Miller says I am The Man 
 Ask the birds singin I am The Man 
 Everyone is a fan 
 A little walk through the neighborhood 
 People nod cause its understood 
 Mr Henry comes out to stand 
 A wave and shoutout to The Man 
 By popular demand 
 The little skinhead with the tattooed face 
 Shows me a moment of style and grace 
 The old hippie with the tiedye headband 
 Flashes a peace sign to The Man 
 Well I do what I can 
 The angry redneck in his pickup truck 
 Tips his hat and gives the thumbsup 
 The New Age guy with the yoga mat 
 Blesses me with a pat on the back 
 The longhaired indie rock kid in a band 
 Looks through his hair and shakes my hand 
 The old homeless guy who smells like pee 
 Stops talking nonsense and says Morning E 
 Its all part of the plan 
 The thug rapper with the gold and chains 
 Puts in his grill and says Good day 
 The politician going door to door 
 Says No vote means more to me than yours 
 You know Id win if I ranI like your toothy smile 
 It never fails to beguile 
 Whichever way the wind is blowing 
 I like the way this is going 
 I like the color of your hair 
 I think we make a handsome pair 
 I can only see my love growing 
 I like to watch tv with you 
 Theres really nothing I would rather do 
 Then maybe we can go to bed 
 And get up and do it all again 
 I like the way your pants fit 
 And how you stand and how you sit 
 Whatever seeds that youre sowing 
 I dont care about the past 
 None of it was made to last 
 Its not what who youve known but who youre knowing 
 I like the way this is goingFeeling scared today 
 Write down I am OK 
 A hundred times the doctors say 
 I am OK 
 Im not OK 
 Skin is crawling off 
 Mopping the sweaty drops 
 Sticking around for this shit 
 Another day 
 Not another day 
 Pink pill feels good 
 Finally understood 
 Take me in your warm embrace 
 I am trying 
 I am tryingLiving lost has been the way 
 Since the day I came along 
 Drifting through the deadeyed days 
 When every turn is wrong 
 And I knew it was the darkest road 
 That Id never know just how 
 To travel on to get somewhere 
 But I thought Id have some answers by now 
 Meaning to find meaning 
 In the most meaningless of times 
 Believing I believed in something 
 Beyond equals in time 
 And I opened up my heart and said 
 This much Ill allow 
 All who enter welcome in 
 And I thought Id have some answers by now 
 Living lost is not the way 
 To go from here on out 
 Existing in the deadeye age 
 Is not all its about 
 And I may not have that far to go 
 I might make it somehow 
 The brightest lights may shine ahead 
 But I thought Id have some answers by nowLalalalalalalala 
 Springfields looking pretty dusty today 
 I see their dreams coming undone 
 The view from inside ward 9 affords this much 
 A town teeming with the unloved 
 Close the window and lock it so its good and tight 
 Lalalalalalalala 
 Lalalalala 
 Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost 
 Have a notsonice day 
 The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake 
 You know I think Im gonna stay 
 Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say 
 Come visit me tonight at eight oclock and then youll see 
 How I am not the crazy one 
 Voices tell me Im the shit 
 Twenty days go by and every day looks the same 
 Im the shitYou know what Im in a good mood today 
 Well Im so happy its not yesterday 
 Man it was brutal with plenty of tissues 
 I guess you could say that I had issues 
 Well its looking good I dug my way out 
 Im changing up what the storys about 
 When the world stops making sense 
 Just takin what you can get 
 When the people on the street 
 Start looking like silhouettes 
 When the words just sound like noise 
 I need a new alphabet 
 I make a new alphabet 
 Small thinking people with their small thinking ways 
 I dont have time to hear what they say 
 This is my world Im staking my claim 
 Thanks for the invite no thanks just the same 
 Its looking good now full speed ahead 
 Ill live today by tomorrow Im dead 
 I see everything 
 Its crystal clear 
 Its here 
 You know what Im in a good mood today 
 Man it was brutal but its all in the past 
 Its good to know that it dont have to last 
 When the world stoṗs making sense 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh ohGot a 3 speed and banana seat 
 Sitting back on the sissy bar 
 Went to Sev and got a drink 
 Wish I was driving in your daddys car 
 And I looked up at the sky last night 
 And I thought I saw a bomb 
 And why wont you just tell me whats going on 
 Riding down on Springhill Road 
 Meeting Alfred out in the woods 
 Dogs bark and mosquitoes bite 
 Scratching the itch that makes it feel good 
 And I looked into the mirror last night 
 All I saw was a pretty blonde 
 Life is funny but not ha ha funny 
 Peculiar I guess 
 You think I got it all going my way 
 Then why am I such a fucking mess 
 Want a pony and a birthday cake 
 Want a party with a scary clown 
 Kneel down and bow to the princess 
 Kneel down for the queen of the town 
 Tell me whats going onWoman driving man sleeping 
 With a suitcase on the rack 
 White lines shooting by 
 On the pavement like the sky 
 Looking straight ahead into the black 
 Woman driving man sleeping 
 Theres no radio to play 
 Sitting with the map 
 Laying crumpled on her lap 
 Looking for the toll money to pay 
 Man sleeping is man dreaming 
 In a large apartment house 
 Walking and knocking on doors 
 Passing all the other cars 
 Searching in the black 
 But never turning to look back 
 A little metal box under the stars 
 Woman driving man sleepingWhat I have to offer 
 Well theres a lot 
 Now Im a modest man 
 But look at all I got 
 For all the wear and tear 
 I look OK 
 I got good manners 
 And I make a good pay 
 And you know Im all full of love 
 For you 
 What I have to offer 
 Well theres so much 
 A caring nature and a 
 Tender touch 
 I got a pleasin 
 Disposition 
 And I dont care about 
 Football or fishin 
 And you know that Im all full of love 
 Well check it out 
 Ive learned some things 
 And I know what its about 
 Im quite discerning and 
 Im pretty smart 
 And it takes an awful lot to 
 Win my heart 
 But you know that Im so full of love 
 For youA happy accident 
 Me running into you 
 Was off of my beaten path 
 Got lost from my crew 
 Out of my element 
 Lost hold of the wheel 
 I didnt anticipate 
 A pleasant ordeal 
 I was getting tired of 
 Always being alone 
 Good thing that Ive always been so 
 Accident prone 
 What made me go that way 
 Well I really dont know 
 Who do I have to thank 
 To what do I owe 
 I was feeling so bereft 
 All my chances blown 
 A happy accident 
 To what do I oweSitting in the funeral parlor 
 On the night before the day 
 Think I mighta left the stove on 
 think I mighta left the door unlocked 
 I dont know if 
 The stores will all be closed when I get out 
 The chores will all be done when I get home 
 Sitting in the funeral parlor 
 Listen to the organ play 
 What if I forgot the trashcans 
 What if I forgot to telephone 
 I wrote the number down in my book 
 I can stand to stay here one more secondCame home tonight 
 And I felt like Id die of loneliness 
 Strange you think 
 Popularity 
 Looking for a simple life 
 Life aint simple 
 Im tired and sick 
 But I dont wanna be alone 
 Ill go to a party 
 But I dont really want to 
 For now Im sitting out here on my porch 
 Writing in the dark air 
 Listening to my little black cat meow 
 Trying to vent some of the terrible passion 
 Thats coursing through me 
 Something about you 
 Something about spending the afternoon 
 Asleep in your arms 
 I hate you 
 FuckerBuying the deluxe edition and all

 How about you just lay back put your feet up 
 And listen to these exclusive bonus Eels tracks right now 
 And here they are ladies and gentlemen 
 The brand new Eels bonus tracks 
 Hold on to your hatMy beloved monster and me 
 We go everywhere together 
 Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves 
 Gets us through all kinds of weather 
 She will always be the only thing 
 That comes between me and the awful sting 
 That comes from livin in a world thats so damn mean 
 My beloved monster is tough 
 If she wants she will destroy you 
 But if you lay her down for a kiss 
 Her little heart it could explode 
 La la la la la la la la 
 La la la la la laIf youre travelin the north country fair 
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline 
 Remember me to one who lives there 
 For she once was a true love of mine 
 If you go when snowflakes storm 
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends 
 Please see she has a coat so warm 
 To keep her from the howling winds 
 Please see if her hair hangs long 
 It rolls and flows all down her breast 
 Please see for me if her hairs hangin down 
 For thats the way I remember her best 
 Im awonderin if she remembers me at all 
 Many times Ive often prayed 
 In the darkness of my night 
 In the brightness of my of my day 
 So if youre travelin the north country fair 
 For she once was a true love of mineIf the worlds a rotten place 
 You better just forget it 
 In the crowd just another face 
 Gonna make em regret it 
 Take a heart and squash it hard 
 Like a little grape 
 Push it down tween boot and ground 
 Til it loses shape 
 And if you feel like you cant swim 
 When youre thrown in the lake 
 Just watch the bugs 
 Passin by you as you 
 Slip under their wake 
 Again 
 If you let your feelings shine 
 You better cover em up kid 
 Aint no sense in wastin time 
 Dream behind your eyelids 
 Like a little bug 
 Swig it down and spit it out 
 And kick it under the rug 
 Like a little ant 
 Scrape it off the sole of your shoe 
 On the welcome mat 
 Ooh 
 OohThat wind ablowin 
 Its getting strong 
 The rain afallin 
 Been falling too long 
 The pressure in the clouds has changed 
 Death rattles our window panes 
 Honey were in a lockdown hurricane 
 They tried to warn us 
 I didnt care 
 Said dont be stupid 
 Get out of there 
 But now I know its much too late 
 Who will discover the remains 
 Dont you see it 
 Were goddamn fools 
 We always had to break the rules 
 That wind ablowin 
 The pressure in the house has changed 
 Honey were in a lockdown hurricaneI bought some rock star ashes 
 From the back of 
 Rolling Stone 
 I guess he wouldnt mind it 
 They couldnt sell his soul 
 The tiger in my tank 
 Is going to go extinct 
 And Im not feelin so good myself 
 I think Im on the brink of disaster 
 I had a dream last night 
 The TV and the phone 
 Grew some legs and took a walk 
 And left me all alone 
 When I grow up Ill be 
 An angry little whore 
 Ill give you all the finger 
 Ill sell you all what for 
 And Im not feeling so good myself 
 I think Im on the brink of disasterYou think youll get under ol monsieurs lid 
 And try to imagine all the things that he did 
 You dont know where Im gonna go 
 You dont know where Ill go 
 Ill go none too bravely into the night 
 Im so tired of living the suicide life 
 That aint no reason to live 
 Wake up in the night and think of all the years 
 Falling from the ceiling and covering your ears 
 You dont know how youre gonna get out 
 You dont know how youll get out 
 Call up your best friend and tell him a lie 
 Youve got to be kidding Im not really high 
 I dont know where Im gonna go 
 I dont know where Ill go 
 That aint no reason to liveSouljacker cant get my soul 
 Ate my carcass in a black man hole 
 Souljacker cant get my soul 
 He can shoot me up full of bullet holes 
 But the Souljacker cant get my soul 
 Left my carcass with the worms and moles 
 He can hang my neck from the old flagpole 
 But the Souljacker cant get my soulIn my heart there lives a little riddle 
 I’m always trying to find my way 
 Everything feels older in the morning 
 I’ll find an answer some day 
 But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But you know I’m alright 
 I’m feeling kinda fuzzy 
 But the sun’s shining bright 
 Don’t mess with me I’m up for a fight 
 It’s a tangled cobweb that I weave 
 The dusty room of an aching mind 
 Anything that keeps the sun rising 
 I got to see if I can find 
 But the future looks bright 
 Don’t mess with me I’m up for the fight 
 Riding through like an outlaw drifter 
 Never knowing which way to turn 
 In the moment I think I’ve got it 
 It’s gone 
 Pull the curtains open wide 
 Gotta know that I’m about it 
 Good God It’s another day 
 Don’t ever doubt it 
 You know I’m alright 
 In my heart there lives a little riddle 
 I don’t know what it’s going to take man 
 I only need a little break man 
 I know you know that I’m a good man 
 Yeah 
 Yeah owIf you see natalie 
 Send along this message 
 I know that youve been through 
 An awful lot of late 
 Girl 
 Steady the trembling hand 
 Thats what you do 
 Steady your trembling hands 
 And see whats in front of you 
 Friends and fortunetellers 
 They all say youre gonna die 
 If you dont brighten up 
 You know you gotta try 
 Then see whats in front of you 
 If you see natalie 
 You may not need this world 
 But this world needs you here 
 You might not feel it now 
 But youre gonna get there 
 And see it somehow 
 Youre gonna be alright girlMy timing is off 
 She isnt ready for my love 
 Its all that Ive got 
 But its a pretty big thing 
 That she should recognize 
 The truth between us cannot hide 
 She knows that its real 
 But the situation doesnt fit 
 I know what I feel 
 And I know that this is really it 
 The thing its all about 
 And I dont have a single doubt 
 My timing is off 
 But sometimes thats how it all works 
 Believe it or not 
 We dont have a choice in matters of the heart 
 Just gotta be brave enough 
 To love and let yourself be loved 
 But Im not worried about a thing 
 She couldnt throw it all away 
 For fear of happiness 
 This isnt like that other messShe locked herself in the bathroom again 
 So I am pissing in the yard 
 I have to laugh when I think how far its gone 
 But things arent funny any more 
 I drew a line into the dirt 
 And dared her to step right across it 
 And she did 
 So I am knocking on the door again 
 I say Do you want to be alone 
 She says No I dont wanna be alone 
 But I think that you do 
 And I know shes right I know how it would be 
 If I had my own way with the world 
 As I know it should be 
 She locked herself in the bathroom again 
 So Ive been shutting down the lights 
 And I dont know if Ill ever go back again 
 Im drivin straight into the night 
 And she didHello this is Koool G Murder 
 OK so that was the new Eels album

 Wonderful and life enhancing experiencing listening to it is 
 But hold on there since you made the smart choice to purchase a deluxe edition 
 More of your life is about to be enhanced 
 Please sit back now and enjoy some bonus Eels material 
 I think youre going to dig itLittle field mice living under the house 
 Never eating much tough life for a mouse 
 And if you think youre gonna be spared 
 Youre wrong 
 Field mice head lice 
 Spiders in the kitchen 
 Dont think twice 
 Bout whatever keeps you itchin 
 Ice water flyswatter 
 Gonna get you through 
 The day 
 Heat is rolling in like Hells red rug 
 Stinking like the breath of Beelzebub 
 And if you think you wont walk on coals 
 You will 
 Thats real goodStanding in the dark outside the house 
 Breathing the cold and sterile air 
 Well I was thinking how it must feel 
 To see that little light 
 And watch it as it disappears 
 And fades into 
 And fades into the night 
 So I know youre going pretty soon 
 Radiation sore throat got your tongue 
 Magic markers tattoo you 
 And show it where to aim 
 And strangers break their promises 
 You wont feel any 
 You wont feel any pain 
 And the streets are jammed with cars 
 Rockin their horns 
 To race to the wire 
 Of the unfinished line 
 Thought that Id forget all about the past 
 But it doesnt let me run too fast 
 And I just wanna stand outside 
 And know that this is right 
 And this is true 
 And I will not 
 Fade into 
 Fade into the night 
 Standing here in the darkIn the morning 
 When the birds are still asleep 
 You can feel it 
 No cars are on the street 
 Its anybodys day 
 It could go any way 
 Why wouldnt you want to make 
 The most of it 
 In the morning 
 Theres nothing left to prove 
 If its your game 
 Its time to make a move 
 Dont look the other way 
 Youre gonna have your say 
 It really count 
 Yesterday is just a dream 
 Out the window 
 Take a look at all you see 
 Baptized by the sun 
 Go on and have some fun 
 Why wouldnt you want to have 
 The greatest dayI need a mother 
 Im sorry but its true 
 I need a lover 
 Not someone like you 
 I been your daddy for too long of a time 
 Need a little mothering just once in a while 
 I need a mother 
 Its undercover the way its always been 
 I should have said something 
 But I didnt know where to begin 
 Youve been taking everything I have to give 
 But I dont have no more 
 This aint no way for me to live 
 Im sorry thats just how it is 
 Its really nothing new 
 A little help sometimes 
 Thats just what you do 
 Need a little help you know 
 Just once in a while 
 Im sorry but its trueMother couldnt love me 
 But that didnt stop me 
 From liking her 
 She was my mom 
 And I was no son of a bitch 
 Daddy was a drunk 
 A most unpleasant man 
 Asleep on the floor 
 Just inside the front door 
 With a smile underneath his red nose 
 The wrong look his way 
 Well that could really wreck his day 
 And believe me when I say 
 It would wreck your day too 
 Grandma took me in 
 Though times were pretty thin 
 Said I was no son of a bitch 
 Down on my knees 
 Begging God pleaseWas I wrong about the world 
 Its a beautiful new place 
 Where else could a creep like me 
 Meet such a pretty face 
 Meeting every day with the rising sun 
 Looking up its looking like 
 My losing streak is done 
 Used to always feel like 
 Wished that I was dressed better 
 Never had a lot of luck 
 Until I finally met her 
 Feeling like the weight that weighed a ton 
 Lifted off my shoulders now 
 Always felt like giving in 
 To the feeling I cant win 
 But I took it on the chin 
 Now Im finally cashing in 
 I said my losing streak is done 
 Did you hear me 
 I said my losing streak is doneEvery time I find myself in this old bind 
 Watching the death of my hopes 
 In the ring so long gonna prove em wrong 
 Im not knocked out but Im on the ropes 
 Ive got enough fight left inside this tired heart 
 To win this one and walk out on my feet 
 No retreat 
 I may never get everything I bet 
 But Im a man who always copes 
 Im hurting bad and fighting mad 
 Everything that I hold near and dear to me 
 Is riding on this moment here and now 
 I know how 
 No defeat 
 Gonna feel so good when its understood 
 Behold the rebirth of my hopes 
 In the ring so long gotta prove em wrong 
 Im not knocked out but Im not on the ropesSad foot sign 
 Why you gotta taunt me this way 
 The happy side is broken now 
 Its gonna be an awful day 
 And if I have to drive back by 
 To see from a different side 
 Would it be enough to say 
 The first time was a lie 
 Sad foot sign 
 The end is coming 
 Thats what they say 
 Maybe you could see it in 
 Your heart for one day 
 To let me feel what its about 
 To really be alive 
 To live and breathe and see and feel 
 Then I can die 
 And when I come back to this world 
 Ill put on the uniform 
 And go into the foot sign shop 
 Where you were bornYou need help baby youve come unhinged 
 Its clear to everybody youre on the fringe 
 Thought Id stay until I died 
 But the twinkle in your eye is gone 
 And now all thats left is a mean old girl 
 Behind her crazy eyes 
 We were good together as good as it gets 
 I only wanted to help you from the day we met 
 And Im sleeping on the couch for months on end 
 You were more than my girl 
 You were my best friend 
 All thats left is a mean old girl 
 I defy you to defy me 
 In your crazy state 
 You dont which way is up 
 And its way too late 
 To ever fix all of the things 
 That you did break 
 Not least of which 
 Is my heartI know I went too far this time 
 Got the world out got nothing inside 
 Painted myself in a little corner 
 No one dares to knock at the door now 
 Things that I I ever heard was 
 Itll be alright you shoulda heard that one 
 Have a laugh when you think about it 
 Just try not to think about it right now 
 This time will be the last time 
 Its not that I dont admire your reserve 
 Its just that Im not feeling so good 
 Think about it itll be alright 
 Think about me I got nothing inside 
 Think about me I got nothing insideBlue light is flickering 
 Through the city streets 
 One billion tv sets 
 Glowing off concrete 
 One day closer to death 
 I know that I dont have too long 
 Whatever happened to Soy Bomb 
 Lunch box collector loves 
 All the pussycats 
 But when he goes to bed 
 He wonders where hes at 
 Thrift store shirts and old haircuts 
 Living in an old sitcom 
 The day is coming 
 When youll have to think of it 
 Was it really worth it 
 All that shit 
 Blue light is flickering 
 Though the cloudy sky 
 One billion lonely hearts 
 Beat until they die 
 Whatever happened to Soy BombI am a lone wolf 
 I always was and will be 
 I feel fine I am resigned to this 
 I am a lone wolf 
 Got my cares 
 Wrapped up all nice and neat 
 In my suitcase 
 Ill take it down the street 
 To a place with plenty of space for me 
 It blows my mind 
 That people wanna try to get inside my tired head 
 Nobody needs to get too close to me 
 Youll only see this truth 
 I am a lone wolfAah aah aah aah 
 Before I sputter out 
 Aah aah aah aah 
 Before I sputter outThings were good for a couple of minutes 
 But now its one hard faith 
 The super marking card makes you home 
 I push it by myself 
 Im your brave little soldier 
 And everything will be alright 
 Coming home to you tonight 
 Gonna be alright 
 Stand in line at the playboy rigor 
 Ski mask yawning at my face 
 Laying on the floor thinking how I 
 Forgot to pray last night 
 Its money in the cup big loves a gift 
 I wont forget you 
 Gonna be alright alrightI wanna open my present 
 Look at it rapped up in little pink bows 
 Packed up tight just waiting for me 
 To rip it open and set it free 
 Relieve my state I just cant wait 
 I wanna open my present 
 Well Im a good boy I behave myself 
 Ive been patient and waiting so long 
 But waiting any longer it just feels wrong 
 I know its great I just cant wait 
 Its right in front of me 
 I cant stop thinking about it 
 Whats the harm in letting me 
 Go no longer living without it 
 Well Ive been working too hard for too long 
 Sayin my prayers and gettin my sleep 
 Been real quiet not making a peep 
 Look at it wrapped up in little pink bows 
 I wanna open my presentWell its another warm day 
 In the city of cold hearts 
 They all just play the part 
 Of who they are 
 And Im here on my own 
 Id rather be alone 
 Than try to be someone that Im not 
 And you seem like someone 
 Who could appreciate the fact 
 That Im no ordinary man 
 And its misunderstood 
 What youve heard about me 
 I see why you would doubt me 
 But know this 
 No one has a right 
 Until theyve fought my fight 
 To understand just where Im coming from 
 And its that fight that brought me here today 
 Exactly as I am 
 No ordinary man 
 Well its another warm day 
 It ends before it starts 
 In their maze 
 But you youre not like that

 Our love told in a heart 
 Its there drawn in the playground 
 Love kiss hate or adore 
 I love Jennifer Eccles 
 And I know that she loves me 
 And I know she loves me 
 La la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 I used to carry her satchels 
 She used to walk by my side 
 But when we got to her doorstep 
 Her dad wouldnt let me inside 
 One Monday morning found out Id made the grade 
 Started me thinking that maybe she done the same 
 I hope that Jennifer Eccles 
 Is going to follow me there 
 Our love is bound to continue 
 I know that she loves me 
 And I know that she loves EAt the dark end of the street 
 Thats where wed always meet 
 Hiding in shadows where we dont belong 
 Living in darkness to hide our wrong 
 You and me at the dark end of the street 
 You and me 
 I know that times gonna take its toll 
 Weve got to give back all the love that we stole 
 Its a sin and we know its wrong 
 Oh but our love keeps coming on strong 
 Steal away to the dark end of the street 
 Theyre going to find us 
 Oh someday 
 And if by chance we walk downtown 
 If you should see me just walk on by 
 But darling please dont cry 
 Tonight well meet at the dark end of the streetThe old oak tree had roots so far down in the ground 
 I fell from it and hit the dirt without a sound 
 I dreamt at night of growing wings so I could fly 
 A caterpillar to a moth before I die 
 I plodded through ordinarily earthbound 
 I knew my feet could never leave the ground 
 I went about my way unsteady and afraid 
 How could I know I was headed for this day 
 All the seconds 
 And the minutes 
 And the hours 
 And the days 
 And the weeks 
 And the months 
 And the years of my life 
 It was all worth it 
 To be here now 
 Im a hummingbird 
 Floatin tree to tree 
 Beautiful and free 
 The old oak tree was dead I had to cut it down 
 The sapling roots were new and sprouting through the ground 
 New worlds were taking shape unseen and unknown 
 A branch to rest upon a place to call my own 
 Something had changed and Im not sure how or why 
 I wasnt dreaming I was awake I was alive 
 Gave up the ghost he had nothing left to say 
 But it was him who brought me to this day 
 Beautiful and freeThe kids are digging up a brand new hole 
 Where they put their deadbeat mom 
 Grandpas happy watching video porn 
 With the closed caption on 
 And father knows best 
 About suicide and smack 
 Well hehehe 
 Cancer for the cure 
 Buckle up and endure now baby 
 Cancer for the 
 Cure 
 Old blue eyes is back again 
 But he was never here in the first place 
 A heart attack may be something to fear 
 But take a look out back 
 Cause Courtney needs love 
 And so do I 
 Well hehehehe 
 Cancer for the cure my baby 
 Buckle up and endure now sweet thing 
 The cancer for the 
 The cancer for the cure 
 Hehehe 
 Cancer for the cureEveryday I wake up and wonder why 
 Im alone when I know Im a lovely guy 
 Birds come down from skies so blue 
 See all the beautiful things you do 
 Why cant I just get with you 
 Every night I carry out my plan 
 Pray to God that one day I could be your man 
 Why cant I just get with 
 Youd be my only friend in the world 
 Or you could just be my girl 
 And if I do run away from this life 
 There wont be much for me in the afterlife 
 Although I know that you dont even care 
 Id rather stay in a world where 
 OohMy beloved monster and me 
 That comes from living in a world thats so damn mean 
 If she wants she will disrobe you 
 La la la la la laHey Man What 
 Hey Man What 
 Hey man What 
 Dig this 
 Well I went walkin out yesterday 
 A man was carryin a sign that says 
 The world is gonna end tomorrow 
 Hey buddy got a nickel I can borrow 
 This rotten worlds gonna chew you up 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back out 
 The sooner you recognize this simple fact 
 Then this rotten world gives you what you lack 
 Old Miss Headtrip shes gettin down 
 You dont see her much walkin round town 
 Well you could say that she needs a little lovin 
 Lookin for a light with her head in the oven 
 Then this rotten world gives you what you lack lets rock 
 Miss Kovalov shes lookin good 
 Walkin her ass through the neighborhood 
 She knows somethin that you dont know 
 Somethin she learned about a long time ago 
 Swallow you whole and then spit you back outJehovahs Witness leave me alone 
 Jehovahs Witness Im not at home 
 Keep on aknockin and aringin the bells 
 Knockin your way straight to Hell 
 Jehovahs Witness lets not pretend 
 That for one second you are my friend 
 Knock on my door and Ill turn out the light 
 Close the curtains and turn in for the night 
 Jehovahs Witness why must it be 
 Just when Im feelin good I look out and see 
 Youre walkin up in your very nice suit 
 Walk down some alley where theyll give up a hoot 
 Jehovahs Witness leave me alone 
 Jehovahs Witness Im not at homeThe longing is a pain 
 A heavy pressure on my chest 
 It rarely leaves 
 My day becomes a quest 
 To try not to think about her 
 And all that she brings 
 Forget about her magic 
 All the beautiful things 
 Surely there are other things to life 
 But I cant think of one single thing 
 That matters more than just to see her 
 Just to see her 
 Her smile 
 Her touch 
 Her smell 
 Her laugh 
 The longing is a friend 
 A way to stay close 
 And feel like shes here 
 And feel like she knows 
 That when I say I would die for her 
 Its not just words I really would 
 And to make the world a safer place for her 
 Well I believe I really could 
 To see her 
 Her tears 
 Her sorrow 
 Her faults 
 Her doubts 
 I love them allMy friend was lyin 
 The grass was dyin 
 It felt like a story you dont care where it leads 
 A change of venue 
 Will it mend you 
 If the grass is not greener you know what it needs 
 I knew that I had to throw down some seeds 
 Oh so lovely 
 Lord above me 
 I feel my heart changin in mysterious new ways 
 Everybody 
 Now how can I tell you how grateful I am 
 Fairweather friends 
 They make amends 
 But you look in their eyes and you know its not real 
 A little carin 
 And soulbarin 
 The actors contract pays him how to feel 
 I knew it was time to make a new deal 
 Jacaranda bloomin 
 No clouds are loomin 
 The trees are swayin 
 In the wind 
 Up in the mornin 
 Without a warnin 
 The sun is ashinin like a newborns smile 
 Its time we faced it 
 Dont wanna waste it 
 I could run away but thats just not my style 
 And I think that I just might stay here a while 
 YeahI was wrong about Bobby I admit 
 Hes not the dumbest angry young nitwit 
 No he can cut it with the best 
 And youd better get out of his way 
 His girlfriend keeps him living in 
 A world where fear will always win 
 And if you see him out tonight 
 Well youd better get out of his way 
 You gotta give it up for the new modern man 
 Hes gonna have a ball give it all that he can 
 Someday hes gonna show us all I bet 
 Out in the sun while were all soaking wet 
 If its a dry life that you want 
 Then youd better get out of his way 
 I was wrong about Bobby dont you know 
 Hes had it tough and he had to make a go 
 But if he doesnt stop fucking with me 
 Well hed better get out of my way 
 Yeah hed better get out of my way 
 Hed better get out of my wayWell the sun is shining but it dont feel good 
 Dont smile down on this neighborhood 
 When I go walking through this stinkin town 
 Well mister I keep my eyes down 
 The brotherhood of the misunderstood 
 Live and die here in all likelihood 
 Youre livin in this town 
 Better pray for sundown 
 And baby when you go downtown 
 You keep your eyes down 
 Fairweather friends need not apply 
 The man of the house is not inside 
 Baby Im keeping my eyes down 
 Go with the flow or ya gotta be sick 
 Think Id rather hear my heart not tick 
 But if ya dont wanna wear a hospital gown 
 Better get out now or keep your eyes down 
 Well the sun is shining but it dont feel good 
 Mister I keep my eyes down 
 The sun is shining but it dont feel good 
 I keep my eyes down 
 Mister I keep my eyes 
 I keep my eyes downWe were on this car trip and I was looking at these rows and rows of trees all along the highway 
 I dont know what kind of trees apples or something 
 There were just like thousands and thousands of rows with a thousand trees each 
 And I picked one tree that I could see about eight trees back in this one row in the middle 
 Just one in a billion and thats how I feltI like a girl with a dirty mouth 
 Someone that I can believe 
 We had a window not open too long 
 But that time is good and gone 
 And if I ever see her again 
 Just walking by with some new guy 
 I know that we will need to pretend 
 And hope our eyes keep telling lies 
 Sit on the back porch and wonder bout her 
 What is she doing right now 
 Making somebody a happier man 
 Dying her hair back to brown 
 Once in a while your life gets so good 
 Worth all the trouble of the past 
 That was the case but I think I always knew 
 Good things dont ever last 
 I like a girl with a dirty mouth 
 Know that I can trust her 
 We had our time but it didnt last too long 
 And that time is good and gone 
 That time is good and gone 
 That time is good and goneVice President Fruitley

 Cmon to where you need to go 
 I think you know where Im goin 
 This song is all about you 
 I wanna be with you 
 Every day and night 
 Cause I say

 Oh come on baby 
 Oh baby baby baby 
 I really think that maybe we could go 
 Oh I think youre cool 
 Come on lets drool 
 La dee da doo 
 Doo dee doo dee doo doo 
 Get off your sled and go to bed 
 Dont you ever tire 
 Throw a bone Im finally home 
 Curled up by the fire 
 Snow is falling from the sky 
 Like ashes from an urn 
 Sweet dreams my little one 
 Now its my turn 
 Well Christmas is going to the dogs 
 Wed rather have chew toys than Yule logs 
 And things arent looking very good its true 
 So Ill just lay here and chew 
 Now when I sleep I like to dream 
 Of rabbits in the snow 
 Jumping right into my jaws 
 From their rabbit hole 
 Take one home and set him down 
 Right next to your shoes 
 Wake up to a big surprise 
 My gift to you 
 And Christmas is going to the dogs 
 Were scarfing down the turkey and egg nog 
 So Ill just stay here and chewLaying on the bathroom floor 
 Kitty licks my cheek once more 
 And I I could try 
 But waking up is harder when you wanna die 
 Walters on the telephone 
 Tell him I am not at home 
 Cause I think that I 
 Am going to a place where I am always high 
 My names Elizabeth 
 My life is shit and pissIf youre scared to die 
 Youd better not be scared to live 
 Ive been spending all my days 
 Giving all I can give 
 Last night I heard someone walk in 
 Through my bedroom door 
 What they wanted Im not exactly sure 
 A friendly ghost is all I need 
 Marking time on a broken watch 
 Counting days till the old pawn shop 
 Sells me back my saxophone 
 Then everyones gonna leave me alone 
 Two times I thought I heard someone 
 Knocking on the glass 
 I hid my head and prayed that it would pass 
 If youre scared to die 
 You better not be scared to live 
 Ive been carrying round a grudge 
 Think I better forgive 
 Last night I heard footsteps walking 
 On the attic floor 
 I got up and I opened up the door 
 A friendly ghost 
 Is all I need 
 Giving all I can giveI was at a funeral the day I realized 
 I wanted to spend my life with you 
 Sitting down on the steps at the old post office 
 The flag was flying at halfmast 
 And I was thinkin bout how everyone is dying 
 And maybe its time to live 
 I dont know where were going 
 I dont know what well do 
 Walked into the Thriftee 
 Saw a man with the hollow eyes 
 Who didnt give me all my change 
 But it didnt bother me this time 
 Cause I know Ive only got this moment 
 And its good 
 I went to the gas station 
 Old woman honked her horn 
 Waiting for me to fix her car 
 Laying in bed tonight Im was thinking 
 And listening to all the dogs 
 And the sirens and the shots 
 And how a careful man tries to dodge the bullets 
 While a happy man takes a walk 
 And maybe its time to liveNew shit 
 New shit 
 Mr E be puttin it down Im the hottest round 
 I told yall mother What yall cant stop me now 
 Listen to me now Im lastin twenty rounds 
 And if you want me Fucker then come on get me now 
 Is you with me now YES then biggie biggie bounce 
 I know you dig the way I swswswitch my style 
 People sing around 
 Now people gather round now people jump around 
 Get your freak on 
 Getcha getcha getcha getcha getcha freak on 
 WHOS THAT BUTCH People you know 
 Me and Tommy been high since twenty years ago 
 What da dilly yo now what da drilly yo 
 You wanna battle me then Cracker lemme know 
 HOLLA Got to feel it son 
 Lemme throw you some Oto muzyka 
 People here I come now sweat me when Im done 
 We got the radio shook like we got a gun 
 In polish it means This is musicIt was late had some drinks 
 It was only our second date 
 She looked good real real good 
 I wanted to do what I could 
 Im not one to jump in the pond without checking 
 How deep the water may be 
 But I knew this was it we each said to get 
 A 200 Tattoo 
 It hurt a little hell it hurt a lot 
 But a man who wont commit is something Im not 
 A little tear rolled down her face 
 When it was done we went back to her place 
 But I knew shes the one and Im telling you son 
 I got a 200 Tattoo she did too 
 A 200 TattooEverettP Boo 
 A lot of what she said and much of what she did 
 I dont doubt that she meant well while drifting and wounded 
 But its a game she plays a game Id never win 
 Those days arent coming back to change the state Im in 
 In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about 
 Making up reality and jealousy and doubt 
 I bow out 
 Everything I am or what I used to be 
 Is not part of the hollow shell of a man that you see 
 All the time unsure all my days a waste 
 Never knowing where I stood much less which way I face 
 I bow outI cant live in a world 
 That you have left behind 
 Seen a lot been through too much 
 But this is where I draw the line 
 Its not where youre coming from 
 Its where youre going to 
 And I just wanna go with you 
 December is a lonely month 
 In a year of lonely days 
 Its hard to tell which way is up 
 Or down or out or through the haze 
 People cheat and people lie 
 While you just watch it all go by 
 Counting days until you die 
 The stars shine in the sky tonight 
 Like a path beyond the grave 
 When you wish upon that star 
 Theres two of us you need to save 
 And I just wanna go with youSomethings not right I dont understand 
 Nowadays I keep to myself 
 Everybody else can look some other way 
 Things I say seem to get me into trouble 
 That Ive been through for too many days 
 And trouble is a friend of mine 
 Id like to leave behind 
 I like my friends more refined 
 Things I lose 
 Weighing on my heart 
 Every time I start to think 
 Maybe its through 
 A little lie 
 Goes a long way when you cant say 
 Quite for sure whats the truth 
 The truth is something no one really 
 Wants to hear you say 
 Just how you doin and have a nice day 
 Nowadays you go for a walk 
 Better not stop and wave or say hello 
 Just this song 
 People will spit give you shit 
 Just for looking at them 
 And for walking too slow 
 Slowly and methodically 
 Ill lock the world away 
 Haunted by my better daysYeah shes all right 
 Just floatin through her day 
 People throwin words round 
 And talkin such trash 
 Theres so much she could say 
 Thats not her way 
 Ive been a fool 
 Other things on my mind 
 Its not hard to assess 
 The many terrible things she could say 
 But thats not her way 
 People thats not her way 
 Yeah shes all right 
 She knows who she is 
 She could stop and remind me of 
 The many ways she brightens my day 
 People thats not her wayIt was only last June when her old man ran away 
 She couldnt stop crying cause she knew he was gone 2 stay 
 1035 on a lonely Friday night 
 She was standin by the bar 
 Mmm she was lookin alright yeah 
 I asked her if she wanted 2 dance and she said that 
 All she wanted was a good man and wanted 2 know 
 If I thought I was qualified yeah 
 And I said baby dont waste your time 
 I know whats on your mind 
 I may be qualified 4 a one night stand 
 But I could never take the place of your man 
 It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 
 He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die 
 He left her with a baby and another one on the way yeah 
 She couldnt stop cryin 
 Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay yeah 
 She asked me if we could be friends 
 And I said oh honey baby thats a dead end 
 U know and I know 
 That we wouldnt be satisfied 
 U wouldnt be satisfied with a one night stand 
 And I could never take the place of your man 
 The place of your manHate a lot of things but I love a few things 
 And you are one of them 
 Hard to believe after all of these years 
 That you are one of them 
 Walk down the street Im thinking 
 Everybody move along 
 Ive got a sadhearted needing 
 To belong 
 Nevertheless its all the mess you made 
 But I cant let it go 
 Look at all the ants in the farm 
 Ive got a sadhearted feeling 
 To harm 
 Hate a lot of things but I love a few things 
 And you are one of themSlept in all day 
 In dirty sheets 
 The stain on my shirt 
 Been there for weeks 
 When I was young I had a dream 
 I would be held in high esteem 
 I thought Id end up a gentleman 
 Distinguished respected refined 
 The life that Ive led 
 Its better unsaid 
 The world has no use for my kind 
 Too many years 
 Getting my way 
 Never let anyone 
 Have their say 
 How could I think it would work out 
 Never a question never a doubt 
 Accomplished revered and admired 
 Im better off dead 
 The world has no room for my kindShe has an easy going way 
 It doesnt matter what youd say 
 I understand just what she means 
 When she says she doesnt care 
 She doesnt let it wreck her day 
 Shes a kindred spirit 
 She doesnt have an act 
 Shes got a real big heart 
 And I gotta win it back 
 Hard to say how much it meant 
 The best days Ive ever spent 
 She understands just what I mean 
 When I say that I dont care 
 She knows my true intent 
 With no plan of attack 
 Every day I live in regret and pain 
 You just dont let that get away 
 Theres a kindness that she hears 
 She knows were all so full of fear 
 When all fades to black 
 And I gotta win it backThwarted again missing in the crowd 
 A friendly voice calling clear and loud 
 My big mistake thinking that I knew 
 How to get by independent of you 
 The imatures they have the chance 
 Quick to forget who brought em to the dance 
 Loyalty is paramount to me 
 Its very clear we make a winning team 
 We gotta stick together 
 Thats right we gotta stick together thats right 
 Stay confident doin Im okay 
 With anything you may do or you may say 
 Were always in quite good company 
 If Im with you and you know you are with me 
 Its me and you taking all now our comers 
 Watching it fall and nothing could be funner 
 The challenges only make us stronger 
 Outlast em all forever maybe longer 
 Battle stations gotta made the guns now 
 Everywhere you look and now they try to take us down 
 Honorable the only thing to do 
 You count on me cause I gotta count on you 
 Im gonna pay up everything I owe 
 You just get ready this is the real show 
 Lets stick togetherThey told me that I couldnt come back here again 
 Took me for some kind of fool 
 Said I was doing things that never should be done 
 But I dont care about their rules 
 As if I cared bout the little minds 
 In the little heads of the herd 
 Theres nothing you could dream 
 Would be more absurd 
 And everybody knows 
 These are rock hard times 
 I gotta make it through 
 I dont know what it is theyre trying to do to me 
 Make me into some sick joke 
 But no ones laughing and least of all not me 
 Its hard to laugh as you choke 
 Hollywood lies piled up to the sky 
 Floating your way soon 
 Hope you like the rotten stench of doom 
 I dont know what it is they think Im gonna try 
 They dont know what they need to fear 
 The surest sign that the end is coming soon 
 Is right there in the bathroom mirror 
 Everybody knows 
 These are rock hard timesDaisy 
 I never thought Id go 
 Crazy 
 But I never thought you so 
 Until now that I see 
 All the crazy things youre doing 
 Why you wanna ruin it 
 And me 
 Counting numbered days 
 Lately 
 I think you know its true 
 Thats it 
 Its all over Im through 
 For a while we can smile 
 For the people that were passing 
 And even if theyre asking 
 We can lie 
 Looks like the sun is gonna set 
 Know that theres nothing I regret 
 All the things that I learned 
 Well Id like to think I earned it 
 No need to go and burn it down now 
 Ooh oohIf I could love you 
 Im sure I would 
 If I could hold you 
 And feel understood 
 Id be there now 
 But I dont know how 
 Cause I am an animal 
 But now Im afraid 
 Wrap me up tight 
 Keep me safe inside 
 Warm at night 
 I am no more 
 I am not good 
 I am so sorry 
 If you misunderstood 
 Id make it up 
 But I cannot 
 If I am an animalToday is a lovely day to run 
 Start up the car with the sun 
 Packing blankets and dirty sheets 
 A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up 
 All the troubles you and I have seen 
 Cross when the drawbridge light is green 
 Dont look back to that messedup scene 
 And all our troubles will be gone 
 Blowing out over that bridge 
 Floating up into the sky 
 Making the storm clouds cry 
 Ladadadada 
 La ladadada 
 Put out that smoke and breath some air 
 Get a new name and cut your hair 
 All the troubles you and I have seenThis is the day 
 That I give myself up cold 
 The dust of ages 
 Settles on your days 
 And so you shake your coat off 
 And get on your way 
 Bloodshot and trembling 
 A new day has begun 
 And you blow it all away 
 But Im not fuckin around anymore 
 Im on my wayI go to bed real early 
 Everybody thinks its strange 
 I get up early in the morning 
 No matter how disappointed I was with the day before 
 It feels new 
 I dont leave the house much 
 I dont like being around people 
 Makes me nervous and weird 
 I dont like going to shows either 
 Its better for me to stay home 
 Some might think it means I hate people 
 But thats not quite right 
 I do some stupid things 
 But my hearts in the right place 
 And this I know 
 I got a dog I take him for a walk 
 And all the people like to say hello 
 Im used to staring down at the sidewalk cracks 
 Im learning how to say hello 
 Without too much trouble 
 Im turning out just like my father 
 Though I swore I never would 
 Now I can say that I have a love for him 
 I never really understood 
 What it must have been like for him 
 Living inside his head 
 I feel like hes here with me now 
 Even though hes dead 
 Its not all good and its not all bad 
 And dont believe everything you read 
 Im the only one who knows what its like 
 So I thought Id better tell you 
 Before I leave 
 So in the end Id like to say 
 That Im a very thankful man 
 I tried to make the most of my situations 
 And enjoy what I had 
 I knew true love and I knew passion 
 And the difference between the two 
 And I had some regrets 
 But if I had to do it all again 
 Well its something Id like to doComming home from the school today 
 Crying all along the way 
 Aint no way for a boy to be 
 Begging 
 Mama shave me please 
 You little punks think you own this town 
 But someday someones gonna bring you down 
 Life aint pretty for a dog faced boy 
 You take back what you said now 
 Thats the last time I cry 
 You dont know what it is to be a friend now 
 Till I walk beside you on the street and now 
 Ma wont shave me Jesus cant save me 
 Dog faced boy 
 Going back to the school tomorrow 
 Hang my heavy head in sorrow 
 Aint no way to set me free now 
 Dog faced boyIm not having any fun 
 Im not having any fun 
 Friday five sixteen PM 
 And every time you crave for me Im here 
 And anything you hunger for Ill share 
 And I will be quietly standing by 
 While slowly I am dying inside 
 Hold me in your arms 
 And let me be the one 
 Who can feel like I am a child 
 In love 
 Everytime I talk to you youre down 
 Im not happy 
 And every time you need a laugh Im around 
 I wanna be happy but Im not happy 
 Alright scumbag 
 And when you forget Im here Im not 
 It isnt really me that you forgot 
 Whisper now 
 And tell me how 
 You watch me and tell me 
 Somehow Im gonna be alright 
 Im over this 
 Im over thisBaby genius 
 Look how youve grown 
 Where do you go from here 
 Didnt we have some good times 
 After all is said and done 
 Small body and small mind 
 Big head and big headaches 
 My back is broken baby genius 
 Find another rideMy love 
 Let me bring anything your heart desires 
 Everything youll ever need 
 When you rise when you retire 
 Sweet thing 
 Oh my word such a very pretty sight 
 As a swallow in the sun 
 As a sparrow in the night 
 My love 
 Can you not feel it 
 I dont know how to let you go on 
 A swallow in the sun 
 A sparrow in the night 
 All alone 
 Dear heart if I may 
 You are beauty of the earth 
 You are broken like a glass 
 You dont know what you are worth 
 I dont how to let you go on 
 All aloneEfils good and the time is right 
 Ill bundleup and slip away 
 The count is down and the drip is up 
 Its time to split this hunk of clay 
 Now you can bring back my suitcase but you cant bring me 
 And you can have all the money cause you say that you must 
 But if you think that it matters take a look at me 
 And dont close your eyes as I turn into dust 
 Efils good 
 Dont tell me that I cant do this 
 As if you knew but you dont know 
 How efils goodAfter the operation 
 I was in a lotta pain 
 But I look fondly on it 
 Just passin all the days in a haze 
 Layin on the couch and watchin TV 
 After the operation 
 I didnt have a care 
 Id spend whole afternoons 
 Just layin there while I stared 
 At things in the room that made me think 
 I ate a lotta junk 
 Id drift off and fall asleep 
 And have these little dreams 
 Where Im feeling back to my old self againWhat would you say if I left this town tomorrow 
 I guess I would but I know Ill miss the train 
 I know I would 
 Ill take a dogs life 
 Just laying in the sun 
 Cause I dont care for this one 
 Chasing trains and planes and rain 
 Where is my rain falling down 
 Upon a thirsty world 
 I never want to be the same 
 Another time I might have fit in alright 
 But not this time I guess Im just too soon 
 To change my town 
 I dont care for this one 
 Dogs life 
 Dogs lifeYour stepmother hates my guts 
 But I dont really care 
 She dont like me coming around 
 With my short greasy hair 
 She would be your best friend 
 If she had it her way 
 She would take all your best friends 
 And put them away 
 Your stepmother hates my guts 
 But I dont give a damn 
 She thinks Im some kind of scum 
 Cause I dont call her maam 
 She would be you best friend 
 But I wont give up yet 
 I want you so goddamn much 
 But she sure is upset 
 Looking down again I knock on the door 
 There she is looking down on me againYou dont have a clue 
 What it is like to be next to you 
 Im here to tell you 
 That it is good that it is true 
 Birds singing a song old paint is peeling 
 This is that fresh that fresh feeling 
 Words cant be that strong my heart is reeling 
 Try try to forget whats in the past 
 Tomorrow is here 
 Love orange sky above lighting your way 
 Theres nothing to fear 
 Some people are good babe in the hood 
 So pure and so free 
 Id make a safe bet youre gonna get 
 Whatever you need 
 That fresh feeling 
 This is that fresh feelingThe feeling of understanding 
 Is very rare 
 For someone like me its hard 
 To find somebody to care 
 Shes got a way about her 
 Changes everything 
 Shes my sweet lil thing 
 Sweet lil thing 
 Making love with her indie rock 
 Playing on her stereo 
 Holding hands going down the road 
 When she drives me home 
 Shes got a magic about her 
 Makes me wanna sing 
 Spent the day laying in her bed 
 My nose against hers 
 Later we went for a drive 
 Didnt know where we were 
 Man I never felt so alive 
 Nobody gets the girl 
 But baby I do 
 Nobody gets me either 
 But she sees through 
 Shes got a glow around her 
 Shines on everything 
 Shes my sweet lil thingAnother morning in the evening 
 Times strewn on the floor 
 And I don’t even know her name 
 Or if she lives here 
 Had enough but I want more 
 I don’t remember how I got here 
 And how long it’s been now 
 A day or two maybe more 
 Home to home I spent the days 
 Never wandered anywhere 
 I always bit the hand that beat me 
 And they wrote me off 
 It was easy not to care 
 Never trusted anyone 
 Don’t see why I should now 
 Fade some blinking never fair 
 You’re all gonna be sorry 
 When I leave town 
 And get it together 
 For the turnaround 
 Six bucks in my pocket and the shoes on my feet 
 The first step is out the door and onto the street 
 The first step is out the door and onto the streetTheres a bright golden haze in the meadow 
 Theres a bright golden haze in the meadow 
 The corn is as high as an elephants eye 
 And it looks like its climbing clear up to the sky 
 Well 
 Oh what a beautiful morning 
 Yes what a wonderful day look out there 
 Ive got a beautiful feeling 
 Everything everythings goin my way 
 Oh the cattle are standing like statues 
 The cattle are standing like statues 
 They dont turn their heads as they see me ride by 
 And a little brown maverick is winkin her eye 
 She says Oh what a beautiful morning 
 Yes what a wonderful day 
 I got everything everythings goin my way 
 Horns stand please 
 Now perform yeah 
 The sounds of the earth are like music 
 The breeze is as busy it dont miss a tree 
 And a little ol weepin willow is laughin at me 
 I got everything 
 Everythings goin my way 
 Oh baby 
 I wanna thank you little girl 
 For such a wonderful day 
 Everythings goin my wayOne two three 
 Two two three 
 I am a man 
 In great pain over 
 Great beauty 
 Its not easy 
 Standing on my feet 
 These days 
 But you know Im pretty sure that 
 Ive been through worse 
 And Im sure I can take the hit 
 I pushed the bed against the window today 
 So thered only be one side 
 Well its a little less lonely that way 
 But Im still dying inside 
 When I wake up 
 In the middle of the night 
 No ones gonna tell me 
 Ill be all right 
 So many thousands 
 Of days in my life 
 That I dont remember 
 And a small handful 
 Of days that I do 
 Hold near to my heart 
 And one of those days 
 That I remember well 
 Is about me and you 
 When its time 
 To look back on my life 
 Most of it wont seem so important 
 The shit that matters 
 And what Ill really miss 
 Is falling asleep with your arms around me 
 Waking up knowing that youre there 
 Making everything feel right in the world 
 People sleeping 
 In Hazmat suits 
 Taping up their windows 
 Its a mad mad mad mad mad mad world 
 And its hard to make any sense of it 
 But one thing I know that is true in this world 
 Is the love that I felt for you 
 Being on my feet these days 
 Well its a wonder I survive 
 No one taught me how to live on my own 
 Im running scared 
 One sweet day Ill be back on my feet 
 And Ill be all right 
 I just gotta get 
 Back on my feetCant help about the shape Im in 
 I cant sing I aint pretty and my legs are thin 
 But dont ask me what I think of you 
 I might not give the answer that you want me to 
 Oh well 
 Now when I talk to God 
 I know he understands 
 He said stick by me and Ill be your guiding hand 
 Oh wellDont got a lot of time 
 Dont give a damn 
 Dont tell me what to do 
 I am the man 
 If theres a God up there 
 Something above 
 God shine your light down here 
 Shine on the love 
 Love of the loveless 
 Dont have too many friends 
 Never felt at home 
 Always been my own man 
 Pretty much alone 
 I know how to get through 
 And when push comes to shove 
 I got something that you need 
 I got the love 
 The love of the loveless 
 All around you people walking 
 Empty hearts and voices talking 
 Looking for and finding 
 Nothing 
 Dont got a lot of time 
 Dont really care 
 Not selling anything 
 Buyer beware 
 Love of the lovelessIts like Im dressed up in my mamas clothing 
 Its like Im talking to a voice that doesnt exist 
 Its like I got a wire crossed upstairs 
 But all I want is just a little truth and thats it 
 They say Im mental but Im just confused 
 Thay say Im mental but Ive been abused 
 They say Im mental cause Im not amused by it all 
 Another anchorman is on the TV 
 Hes got that far away and vacant look in his eyes 
 I turn the channel but nothing is changing 
 The only truth is that everything is a lie 
 Theres truth in everything theres truth in lies 
 With all this knowledge well I think Im gonna be wise 
 Not at all 
 Not at allHold me like a mother would 
 Like Ive always known somebody should yeah 
 Although tomorrow dont look that good 
 Well it just goes to show 
 Though people say were an unlikely couple 
 Im seeing double of you 
 Oh 
 This is life 
 When everythings all right 
 Living living living living living living living life 
 Oh hope for the hopeless 
 Im learning to cope with the emotionless mediocrity ooh 
 Of day to day living 
 How can I help but be restless when 
 Everything seems so tasteless 
 And all the colours seem to have faded away 
 Hold me like a mother would 
 Doris Day and Mott the Hoople 
 Living living living living living living living lifeHow does her world spin 
 without me in her nest 
 Could there really be such happiness 
 Oh shes got a dark side too 
 Even murderous 
 But I love that just like her 
 I dont have a chance at writing the book 
 I just want to be a page 
 In Jeannies Diary 
 One single page 
 in Jeannies diary 
 Yes I am intense 
 Maybe quite obsessed 
 Everything she does is curious 
 Oh shes going to let me in 
 I just know its so 
 But then again who do I care 
 I dont have a prayer for writing the book 
 In Jeannies diary 
 In Jeannies diary ooh 
 She could have anything she wants 
 So why not me 
 She could have anything she dreams 
 Oh to be 
 In Jeannies diaryWoke up with a bang and a bug on your face 
 It crawled in your mouth and gave you a taste of 
 The good life you left behind 
 But I think youre gonna be fine 
 Somebody loves you 
 And youre gonna make it through 
 This nagging malaise is more than a phase 
 It feels like a job 
 But no boss ever pays you to lay there 
 And think how youll die 
 While the tears start to well in your eyes 
 One more Saturday all alone through the night 
 Youve got to be sure when you turn out that light 
 That its going to turn on again 
 Youve got to be your good friend 
 And youre gonna make it throughMama had a epidural 
 Hoping I would be a girl 
 The night was black the sky was blue 
 The darker clouds are showing noon 
 I heard screaming the doctor shouts 
 Didnt give in I came out 
 And here I am 
 I found my way down the street 
 Chicken hawks filled with meat 
 The man was big the gun was loaded 
 She had cash but never showed it 
 I heard screamin bleeding throat 
 And baby I got on that boat 
 Now im up here in the trees 
 Shaking off the bugs and fleas 
 The days are long the sun is beating 
 Each day I dont die is cheating 
 Send me some lovin 
 Send it now 
 Send it by giraffe or jungle telegraph 
 Or jungle telegraph 
 Or jungle telegraphEverettMurder 
 My plan to play it cool has not been going well 
 I have such a hard time keeping the anger hidden 
 Ive run it through my head a dozen times or more 
 And each time it ends with me not acting as I did 
 A grievous oversight that I cannot erase 
 You couldnt know where to take it to 
 And none of it matters now however I appeal 
 All of its gone Ive missed a good deal 
 You disappointed me in ways I cannot count 
 But you were the best thing to happen to me 
 And that is no reason to forget all that youve done 
 I couldnt expect you to give credence to my plea 
 And none of it matters now however I may feel 
 An effortless beauty I had not come across 
 Its a heavy loss and now its my cross to bear forever more I can be sure 
 And nothing else matters now whatever I reveal 
 All of its gone Ive missed a good dealAh its looking up 
 Let me tell you what I mean 
 Used to be kind of bitter 
 Always had a babysitter 
 But Im feeling much fitter 
 Now Im pretty sweet 
 Back on my feet 
 Walking down the street 
 Yeah Im looking up 
 Its looking up 
 I used to be cruel 
 Kind of a tool 
 Like a damn fool 
 Now Im oh so kind 
 Got no worried mind 
 Im a real find 
 Yeah its looking up 
 Im looking up 
 I never had a clue man 
 How it was gonna go 
 But it goes to show you 
 You just never know 
 It took a little while but Im a real fine man now 
 Never could but I always can now 
 Time has healed me 
 Can you feel me looking up 
 Looking up 
 Ah yeah 
 I said time has healed me 
 Ah 
 Im looking up ah 
 Looking upWith a lustful admiration 
 I look upon you 
 Cant wait until tomorrow 
 The things that well do 
 And this 
 Is where 
 It gets good 
 Permission to speak freely 
 Well I really must confess 
 I cant stop thinking bout you 
 Gettin out of your dress 
 The sky in your eyes 
 The earth in your touch 
 The spirits come together 
 Well its almost too much 
 It gets goodWise men say only fools rush in 
 But I cant help falling in love with you 
 Shall I stay Would it be a sin 
 If I cant help falling in love with you 
 Like a river flows surely to the sea 
 Darling so it goes some things are meant to be 
 Take my hand take my whole life too 
 For I cant help falling in love with youAll my life I had 
 This funny little feeling 
 Came and went time and again 
 Among my daily dealings 
 Call it a deficit 
 An emptiness inside 
 Why is true love hard to find 
 Why does true love hide 
 But now I found you and I know that we would be 
 So very happy if you could only see 
 That I was made for you 
 And you were made for me 
 The road in front of us is long and it is wide 
 Weve got beginners luck 
 Weve got it on our side 
 woah 
 If you are willing well I think im qualified 
 And with beginners luck weve gotta take the ride 
 Ive got a plan you know 
 Ive got it all worked out 
 And all you gotta do is pack your bags 
 And check your doubts 
 Youll come around 
 And you will see just what I am 
 A true love through the worst of times 
 A true love till the end 
 So now you found me and youve only got to see 
 How complimentary we could really be 
 Cause I was made for you 
 We will be stronger if our forces are allied 
 Well take the ride 
 As far as anyone can go 
 Well brave it all 
 Hand in hand and toe to toe 
 Dont worry about a thing 
 Just give your hand to me 
 And here put on this ring 
 If you are willing well I think Im qualified 
 WoahLoyalty is easy when youre king 
 Doesnt matter whos around to bring 
 Some friend you turned out to be 
 Looking cool but anyone can see 
 That you dont know where youre going to 
 But I have some idea 
 Count out  of everybodys wins 
 Thats whatll finally do you in 
 Sorry but Ive got a train to catch 
 Gonna leave you and your schemes to hatch 
 But I have some ideaRemember last year when you were on your own 
 You swore the spirit couldnt be found 
 December rolled around and you were counting on it to roll out 
 Well everybodys waiting for you down at the house 
 The tree is looking so inspired 
 Theres a yuletide groove waiting for you to move 
 Come on and throw another log on the fire 
 Everythings gonna be cool this Christmas 
 Baby Jesus born to rock 
 As the days go by the more that we need friends 
 And the harder they are to find 
 If I could have a friend like you in my life 
 Then I guess Id be doing just fine 
 And everythings gonna be cool this Christmas 
 Everythings gonna be cool this ChristmasNobody listens to a whisperin fool 
 Are you listenin I didnt think so

 Tiptoein everywhere I go

 Ive had enough for bein a mouse 
 I no longer keep my mouth shut 
 Bombs away gonna shake the house 
 Bombs away I will be heard 
 You better listen cause you just might learn 
 Bombs away shoot holler and shout 
 And if you not ready then you better get out now 
 Cat run away 
 You better hope its a good day 
 You dont know how I am 
 If its a bad day there will be no end 
 And your opinions gonna wait its turn 
 Nobody listens to a whisperin fool 
 Youre not listenin I didnt think so 
 Ive had enough of being complacent 
 Ive had enough of bein the mouse 
 Baby do go better watch your back

 Bombs away gonna rattle the house 
 Ha oohLets ruin Julies birthday 
 I didnt get my invite 
 Could be lost in the mail or something 
 Im gonna be there tonight 
 I never cared about her anyway 
 And I guess she never cared 
 About me 
 And what do you mean that I cant go 
 Where does it say that Im a fool 
 Doesnt she know that Im an exception 
 To the rule 
 Lets ruin Julies birthday 
 I can see right through her act 
 She said something about me 
 And all the cool kids made a pact 
 What does she have to celebrate 
 Its not a party if Im not there 
 Just her stupid friends and a birthday cake 
 And what do you mean that I cant go What do you mean I cant go 
 Where does it say that Im a fool You take me for a fool 
 To the ruleDid you think that I would laugh when you said I was small 
 Did you think that that would pass as if nothing at all 
 You say a lot of funny things my little bunny 
 And I almost always laugh but thats not really funny 
 You play the little bells and tell a good story 
 You bake delicious pie and thats enough for me 
 But I am big and Im your man and youre my little honey 
 And I like what you have to say but thats not really funny 
 You must not continue to emasculate me 
 The neighbor children through the window clearly see 
 The little boy will wipe his nose because its runny 
 Then point at me and laugh but thats not really funnyKnow is hope 
 And if youre dirty and you need a shower 
 Youd better be clean for a happy hour 
 The kid out of the river jack 
 And dry yourself on the dark 
 Youre a busy man with things to do 
 And were gonna show you how to rock 
 Like this 
 Were gonna rock like this 
 Were gonna rock this is itWoke up lost 
 In a world I didnt know 
 I shook it off and 
 Im trying to make a go 
 Ever get the feeling that the story isnt done 
 And you know that you are not the only one 
 And I know youre out there somewhere 
 And I know that you are well 
 Looking for an answer 
 But only time can tell 
 Parallels 
 All things being equal 
 Id rather not forget 
 The things Ive seen 
 And the people that Ive met 
 But something down inside me makes me think theres something more 
 And I dont have any proof but Im sure 
 Mmm mmm 
 Woke up lost 
 In a world I cant escape 
 What Ill become 
 Is slowly taking shape 
 Start again is not the end but altogether new 
 And Im never giving up till I find you 
 ParallelsHow can you tell me how much you miss me 
 When the last time I saw you you wouldnt even kiss me 
 That rich guy youve been seein must have put you down 
 So welcome back baby to the poor side of town 
 To him you were nothin but a plaything 
 Not much more than an overnight fling 
 To me you were the greatest this boy had ever found 
 And god its hard to find nice things on the poor side of town 
 I cant blame you for trying 
 Im trying to make it too 
 I got one little hang up baby 
 I just cant make it without you 
 So tell me are you gonna stay now 
 Would you stand by me girl all the way now 
 With you by my side they cant keep us down 
 Together we can make it baby from the poor side of town 
 Together we can make it baby from the poor side of townWhen I was born 
 The doctor said 
 Theres something wrong 
 Inside that baby head 
 When I was a boy 
 In Sunday school 
 I told them all 
 That they were fools 
 All in a days work 
 To live and breathe 
 A sight to see 
 And so it goes 
 I went into 
 The fortune tellers 
 She wouldnt read 
 My horoscope 
 I go into 
 The laundromat 
 The people all 
 Buy extra soap 
 A sight to seeAgatha was beautiful 
 Her long black hair and aching eyes 
 Even when she didnt feel so good she looked alright 
 She always had a smile 
 And it was good for a while 
 I wouldnt answer each time the phone rang 
 But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang 
 Agatha she wasnt mean 
 She didnt cheat she never lied 
 Even if she disagreed with you it wasnt a fight 
 Made you feel like youre both right 
 But then I lost sight 
 I couldnt bear to break up my old gang 
 What was so important then 
 I havent a clue 
 How could I have been so blind and cruel 
 Agatha where did you go 
 Do I have the slightest chance 
 I could make up for everything that I did wrong 
 But I know its just a song 
 And youre probably long gone 
 Forgot all about her 
 Each night that I sang 
 But I should have stayed with Agatha ChangIm gonna tell you 
 What you need to hear 
 And Im a little too late 
 By three or four years 
 And it may not make much sense 
 Now that we are apart 
 But Im going to stop pretending 
 That I didnt break your heart 
 You see I never thought enough of myself 
 To realize 
 That losing me could mean something 
 Like the tears in your eyes 
 And I want to tell you Im sorry 
 And its too late to start 
 And its Christmas Eve 
 Years down the line 
 Sitting here wishing Id treated you better 
 When you were mine 
 And I have no way of knowing 
 Where you are 
 I didnt mean to hurt you 
 I didnt know what I was doing 
 But I know what I have doneMiss OMalley didnt mean what she said 
 Got a heart but a head full of lead 
 She can dream but she never can do it 
 Youre alright and youre gonna get through it 
 People spend their days 
 Trying to find new ways 
 To put you down all over town 
 But theyre not fit 
 To lick your boots 
 Nothing harder to watch 
 Than an Englishman trying to cry 
 Even if he can 
 He can dream but he never can do it 
 Saying you youre the one that blew it 
 To lick your bootsLadies and gentleman I give you Butch 
 Thank you 
 Well there is something I wanted to touch upon this evening 
 I dont remember if I had spoken about it here or 
 in other parts of this wonderful land you call 
 the Isle of whatever the hell you call it 
 Everybody has got a different name 
 It is pretty whatever 
 Anyway 
 Whatever dude okay here 
 The problem is and what I wanted to bring up is 
 A little thing I like to call Hot and Cold 
 Listen 
 sound of hot 
 That is the sound of Hot 
 ssshhhhhttttt 
 sound of cold 
 That is the sound of Cold 
 Listen again 
 Hot 
 Cold 
 In America we have a thing cold two faucets and one spigot 
 Over here wherever we go like backstage right now 
 There is a faucet for the fucking hot water and one for the cold water 
 And I cant mix them together 
 I BURN my hand and then I FREEZE  my hand 
 And then I BURN my hand and I FREEZE my hand 
 No no no no … no clapping 
 Its your problem not mine 
 Im just wondering anybody else having the same problem 
 Im just checking 
 Hot hot hot … BURN 
 Cold cold cold …FREEZING 
 Hot hot hot 
 Cold cold cold cold 
 I WANT BOTH I want both 
 In one spigot hot and cold making warm warm 
 Ah feel the warm water 
 Its not BURNING 
 Its not FREEZING COLD 
 Its in the middle its warm warm 
 I cant wait to get back out to my warm water 
 I just wanted to share that 
 Thank you very muchIve got something 
 Maybe I should tell you 
 I may check out 
 At any given time 
 Things wont get better 
 Until they get much worse 
 Is the curse stronger than me 
 Or am I stronger than the curse 
 Everyone is scared of me 
 And Im scared of me too 
 Never know just what Im gonna do 
 Heads up kittens 
 Everything is bad 
 The sky is dark now 
 But its the best dark I ever had 
 Hang on to a little thing 
 And let it guide the way 
 Bring it with you to 
 Ive got something 
 Im hanging on here 
 And Im really gonna try 
 Am I stronger than the curseIn the evening when the sun goes black 
 I sit alone and I plan my stunning comeback 
 I got your worst and you got my best 
 I passed the test 
 I got a lot from your endless mess 
 Thanks I guess 
 I sleep well knowing everything I earned 
 My companion the lesson that I learned 
 The yellow sky the blue around the clouds 
 To still be standing makes a man feel proud 
 Thanks I guessI cant look at the rocket launch 
 The trophy wives of the astronauts 
 And I wont listen to their words 
 Cause I like 
 Birds 
 I dont care for walkin downtown 
 Crazy auto car gonna mow me down 
 Look at all the people like cows in a herd 
 Well I like 
 If youre small and on a search 
 Ive got a feeder for you to perch on 
 I cant stand in line at the store 
 The mean little people are such a bore 
 But its all right if you act like a turd 
 Ive got a feeder for you to perch onSo youve got balls now 
 Murray on the run 
 Down on Newberry Street 
 Seventeen seconds of fun 
 Apes are overrated blocky 
 A kinky batch of pudding yay 
 Garbage dump pumpkin rot 
 And candy apple gray 
 Werewolf in the flowerbed 
 Perfect day for lucky guy 
 This song was never meant to be released 
 Whats that flaming ball in the sky 
 The crackhead from Texas 
 He can read my feet 
 A bruised piñata 
 And a liquid pixie 
 If friends were flowers 
 Nothing gold can stay 
 Gunsexual sense 
 And squeegee tails 
 Bees in the cookie jar 
 Symphonic despair 
 Reinventing the manifesto 
 Are you We dont care 
 Jacuzzis and bunnies 
 A broken fondue set 
 Koool G is in the outhouse 
 You can be my Mr French 
 This old Frisbee 
 Is shitting in the alley 
 I saw a naked picture of me on the internet 
 Wearing Jesus new snowshoes 
 Golly gee 
 If Hell is crowded then we shall sing 
 A hip song for the kids in the back 
 For Michelle and the dripping of a faucet 
 Ride the vicious bicycle on the tracks 
 Olympic mayonnaise Doctor Thunder 
 Low occupancy vehicle stops and starts 
 With Hollywood suspicion 
 The doctor has snake heartsThese are the sounds of the days that are past 
 A miracle was about to happenIts a beautiful morning 
 The sky is black as ink 
 The citys sleeping still 
 And soon theyll wake up to the stink 
 And soon theyll wake up 
 To the stink of life passing them by 
 Wake up and smell the stink of their lives 
 The garbage trucks are coming 
 To take your shit to the dump 
 Youre smelling pretty now 
 Such a pretty little lump 
 A pretty little lump of flesh 
 Whos lost your way 
 Another night another day 
 And when you sleep at night 
 Dreaming of the pretty things 
 Dont be too surprised 
 When the telephone rings 
 Wooh wooh 
 Ill be sitting here 
 Waiting for the other shoe to drop 
 Waiting for the other shoe to dropStrollin down a green pathway 
 With my fellow invalids 
 Halloween party tonight 
 In the womens gym 
 Saturday night at the dance 
 Id ask you if I dance ooh 
 Mens ward wants me back 
 By 10 not far 
 Take down your half mask 
 And Ill see who you are 
 At three oclock this morning 
 Look through the glass 
 Ill blink the floor lights on and off 
 Like ships that pass 
 Id ask you if i 
 OohTen pounds and a head of hair 
 Came into without a care 
 What they thought were cries were little laughs 
 Only looking forward and moving fast 
 The little bundle had arrived 
 And I was happy to be alive 
 In a magic world 
 Long days and dreaming nights 
 Wide eyes take in all the sights 
 A little wonder goes a long long way 
 Learning where to go and what to say 
 Say hello to your new son 
 Well he sure is having fun 
 Every moments built to last 
 When youre living without a past 
 In a magic worldWent down by the old courthouse 
 Stumbling through the streets 
 Had to get out of the house 
 Had to use my feet 
 And you may not think much of me now 
 But I think so damn much 
 Of you 
 Dont take any wooden nickels 
 When you sell your soul 
 A devil of a time awaits you 
 When the party is over youre on your own 
 Trash truck coming up the road 
 Picking up the trash 
 Riding to a better place 
 Hoping we dont crash 
 Thinking of things after now 
 I never would have guessed it 
 This way 
 Now the party is over Im on my own 
 la la la laShe used to love me but its 
 Over now 
 That was a good thing thats 
 Gone man gone 
 I pass the hours 
 Just to get by 
 Talk to the dogs 
 So I know that Im alive 
 I never thought that I should quit 
 All the stupid crazy shit that I do 
 In the name of 
 Keepin good things away 
 Some things you can 
 Puck right up 
 Other things 
 Well you better not screw up 
 My problem was 
 That I could not see 
 What was important 
 Right in front of me 
 I never though that I should quit 
 How much longer man 
 Before they surf 
 Its here today 
 But its gone man gone 
 The epitaph scratched upon my stone 
 Here lies a man who just wanna be alone 
 She used to love me but its 
 Gone man goneThe smokestack spotting black soot into the sooty sky 
 The load on the road brings a tear to the Indians eye 
 The elephant wont forget what its like inside his cage 
 The ringmasters telecaster sings on an empty stage 
 Goddamn right its a beautiful day 
 The girl with the cruls 
 And the sweet pink ribbon in her hair 
 Shes crawling out her window 
 Cause her daddy he just dont care come on 
 The clown with the frown 
 Driving down to the sidewalk fair 
 Finger on the trigger 
 Let me tell you gave us quite a scare 
 The kids flip their lids 
 When their lids hear that crazy sound 
 My neighbor digs the flavor 
 Still hes moving to another town 
 And I dont believe hell come back 
 Well I dont know 
 How you take in all the shit you see 
 No dont believe anyone 
 And most of all dont believe me believe you 
 Goddamn right its a beautiful dayTaking a walk down to the mall 
 Smellin piss and beer and gas 
 That could be me in a couple years 
 Suckin fumes under the highway pass 
 On a rainy day 
 While I wear newspapers for pants 
 And a Tshirt that says 
 Damn Im Good 
 People look funny when they cry 
 Cause they just cant let it hide 
 Tapping into your little box 
 Press the cry button it unlocks 
 No one has a thing to say 
 Easier to look the other way 
 Take a look in the killers eyes 
 And you see theres nothing there 
 But something is sacred in your eyes 
 And somethin to believe 
 And as the world will blow to bits 
 Ill cradle you and hold you tightHey 
 Hey 
 Everyone is going fetal 
 Its the dance the kids all feel 
 Just get down under your desk 
 Feels like your mamas nest alright 
 Its the one thats really real 
 Youre gonna love it if you give it a try 
 You just lay down like youre gonna die alright 
 If you feel like your fate is sealed 
 Then just get down and curl on up 
 Just like a little helpless pup alright 
 Going fetal 
 hey 
 heyLilac blowing through the warm summer air 
 Hint of your perfume the smell of your hair 
 Sun is setting and the crows all cry 
 Electrical storm forming in the sky 
 Got a hurt inside that I just gotta heal 
 All I can do is feel feel feel 
 Day is dying and the night is born 
 Baby dont leave me so lovelorn 
 A hungry dog howls through the trees 
 It echoes long on the lilac breeze 
 A blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl I want it bad 
 Birds do it bees do it I wanna do it 
 The only thing we need to do is get down to it 
 Please hear my plea know it comes from the heart 
 Baby you and me got something to start 
 Why wont you hear me 
 Im a desperate man 
 Darlin dont fear me 
 Just say we can 
 Lilac blowing in the warm summer breeze 
 Floatin so soft with the cries in the trees 
 Sun is settin and the day is dead 
 How can I get it through your pretty little head 
 The blackbird sings a song so sad 
 Girl I want it badI put a spell on you 
 Because youre mine 
 Stop the things you do 
 Watch out I aint lying 
 I cant stand 
 No running around 
 And no putting me down 
 I put a spell on you 
 I love you I love you 
 I love you anyhow 
 I dont care if you dont want me 
 Im yours right now 
 Because youre mine mine mine 
 Oh youre mineLife goes on 
 Nothing is new 
 Judge made it clear 
 I cant be near you 
 Everybody knows that Im not a violent man 
 Just someone who knows hes in love 
 I made mistakes 
 Everyone does 
 Dont know why I did 
 I guess just because 
 No one gets through to me the way that you do 
 Now I know Im in love 
 Baby its a little much 
 To never touch you 
 When I know Ill never 
 Find another love like this 
 Life goes on 
 Passing the days 
 Thinking bout you 
 Just someone who knows hes in loveLets go down to the fashion show 
 With all the pretty people that you dont know 
 Well sit down in the velvet chairs 
 Theyll hand awards out for Best Hair 
 And if we dont win one well then 
 Well blow off our heads in despair 
 I smell magic in the room 
 Flashing lights and sonic booms 
 Lovely saps all without a care 
 Nobody said that the world was fair 
 And if they did say so well then 
 Lets go down to the fashion show 
 With all the pretty people and piles of blow 
 And hang on tight to our bus fare 
 And if it falls between the seats 
 Well blow off our heads in despairIts a motherfucker 
 Being here without you 
 Thinking bout the good times 
 Thinking bout the bad 
 And I wont ever be the same 
 Its a motherfucker 
 Getting through a Sunday 
 Talking to the walls 
 Just me again 
 But I wont ever be the same 
 I wont ever be the same 
 How much I understand 
 The feeling that you need someone 
 To take you by the hand 
 And you wont ever be the same 
 You wont ever be the sameTake heart my little friend 
 And push back your seat 
 Soon well be far away 
 Far from the street 
 Where you learned how to be 
 Not what you are 
 Up on the shoulder 
 There is a town 
 With a little motel 
 And an old movie house 
 Well go to a movie 
 Whatever it is 
 Watchin the movie 
 The worlds gonna end 
 And there aint no place for 
 A boy and his friend 
 To go 
 Ill pick some daisies 
 From the flower bed 
 Of the Galaxy Theater 
 While you clear your head 
 I thought some daisies 
 Might cheer you up 
 Oooooooooooooo 
 OoooooooooooooEverything is good these days but 
 All of my friends are dying 
 Davy may and Lisa may but 
 Nobody else really wants to stay 
 I said now open the door 
 Open the door I cant stay here anymore 
 Open the door 
 Candle light the streets at night 
 Thinking youre wrong but you know youre right 
 Everything is good these days but 
 Careful when you say goodbye 
 Careful stays and careless dies 
 But careless is and careful tries 
 Open the doorOoh uh 
 I am el hombre lobo 
 On the prowl for a restless night 
 I got her right here in my sights 
 Got a fuse that I can light 
 Shes tremendous 
 Shes dynamite 
 She is a formidable opponent 
 She could put up a hard won fight 
 Got her head screwed on real tight 
 Being the bomb is her birthright 
 Shes tremendous dynamite 
 On the prowl just past midnight 
 Darting under the town searchlights 
 Its all worth it to take a bite 
 Shes dynamiteMy beloved monster and me 
 Gets us through all nasty weather 
 That comes from living in a world 
 Thats so damn mean 
 If she wants she will disrouge you 
 Lalalalalalalalalalalala lalalalalalaThe cutrate mime walking through the dirty streets 
 Of Paris in the hot August heat 
 Sun melting the fake smile away 
 Just looking for a place to stay 
 The actress gave up all her old dreams 
 And traded up now she is a queen 
 Royal familys dont have time for that shit 
 Your crystal ball you keep it hid 
 The tractortrailor driver radios 
 Help me someone Im out here all alone 
 Truck driving the black night away 
 Praying for the light of day 
 The kid in the mall works at Hawt Dawg on a Stick 
 His hat is a funny shape his heart is a brick 
 Taking your order he will look away 
 He doesnt have a thing to say 
 But me Im feeling pretty good as of now 
 Im not so sure when I got here or how 
 I think you know Ill be okayOoh 
 Like a dying man who you tell 
 You will be alright 
 that is the sell 
 When you know full well it isnt true 
 Thats whats happened between me and you 
 I know how you dont want to see 
 That bored look on my face but you see 
 I dont think you know how to change it 
 Inching towards the end bit by bit 
 Its worth noting that it could be saved 
 If not for the recent events 
 A series of misunderstandings 
 Set the course for a crash landing 
 If I could do just one thing 
 Set the clock back many years ago 
 Id teach that motherfucker that raised you 
 How to treat you right 
 OohYoure my friend youve done a lot of really nice things for me 
 And I wont forget em do you know how much you mean to me 
 Youre my friend and no matter what Im doing you were there for me 
 Without you my ship will surely drift out lost at sea 
 Just when I think Ive ended you too much 
 You always find a way to come through in the clutch 
 And you dont make me feel I owe you but I do 
 Youre my friend from the day we met till the bitter end 
 I dont know how I could have made it any other way 
 Yeah youre my friend coming through again and again 
 Your good will I never will betray 
 Sweet charity all the nice things that you do for me 
 I cant forget em do you know how much that means to me 
 Sweet charity no matter how I screw up you were there for me 
 Without you I cant say how dark the days would be 
 Just when I think Ive handed you too much 
 Youre my friendSun comes up on the old neighbourhood 
 Spray painted bricks and dead firewood 
 Well I dont know where Im gonna be next 
 I dont care where Im gonna be 
 Next time if you think of it 
 You might remember me as 
 The one who let you down 
 But never made another sound of fear 
 Some people like to call me Chuck 
 Its Charles and you are shit outta luck 
 If you think you know what happens next 
 You think you know what happens 
 Sun goes down on the old neighborhood 
 Dark damp has stopped where I once stood 
 I dont know where the bus stops next 
 And I dont care where the bus stops 
 The sound of fear 
 I can hear 
 The sound of fearTheres a spider crawling 
 On the bathroom mirror 
 Right on top of my right eye 
 And I cant stop staring back 
 How did I get this way 
 Take a big look at a living lie 
 Rags to rags and rust to rust 
 How do you stand when youve been crushed 
 So rags to riches was a bust 
 Sometimes I dream about it 
 What its like back home 
 The railroad tracks and the pussy willow 
 But I had to leave it 
 And I go back 
 Whenever my tired head hits the pillow 
 Busted once again 
 But Ill show them one day 
 That I can buy and sell the world 
 And one day Ill come through 
 My American dream 
 But it wont mean a fuckin thing 
 So rags to rags and rust to rust 
 Dont let me go 
 Dont let me goWhat can I tell you you havent heard a hundred times 
 About the man who didnt know hed lost his mind 
 He didnt know hed lost his mind 
 He really thought that he was fine 
 Mary and Joseph look away from what is here 
 Its not gonna be a pretty sight 
 Sight 
 If it could be a little more and a little less 
 Maybe Id get it all together and get out of this mess 
 Im gonna get out of this mess 
 And Ill do my very best 
 To get out of this mess 
 And Ill go where I can breatheShe had the eyes of someone older 
 I have the eyes that wander round 
 I couldnt see what really mattered 
 Caught hell from my boss 
 Dont care about my job 
 Caught a cold from the rain 
 Dont care if Im cold 
 Played every record that I own today 
 But the only thing I care about got away 
 The only thing I care about got away 
 She was a walking work of art 
 I am a broken windup toy 
 I thought I knew what really mattered 
 Got a flat on the road 
 Dont care about my car 
 Lost twentysix bucks 
 Dont care about my rent 
 Caught every episode on tv today 
 She had a brilliant future 
 I have a past 
 I have my memories 
 But theyre fading fast 
 The only thing I care about got awayTurn the ugly light off God 
 Wanna feel the night 
 Every day it shines down on me 
 Dont you think that I see 
 What its all about 
 Hard to look the other way 
 While the world passes me by 
 And everyone is trying to bum me out 
 Its a pretty big world God 
 And I am awful small 
 Every day they rain down on me 
 Flower in a hailstorm 
 Im livin for the drought 
 I could throw it back at them 
 But then Id play their game 
 Everyone is trying to bum me out 
 When I came into this world they slapped me 
 And every day since then Im slapped again 
 Tomorrows king an unsightly coward 
 You see I know Im gonna win 
 Turn the ugly light off God 
 Dont wanna see my face 
 Every day it will betray me 
 Dont you think that I know 
 What theyre talking about 
 If they step on me tonight 
 Theyre gonna pay someday 
 Mmm 
 MmmWhere do you go when 
 The day is done 
 But you are not 
 You look for a friend but 
 Maybe Im 
 All you got 
 Hard to pretend that Ive always been here 
 Ready to be your man 
 And I heard sounds 
 Comin through 
 The bedroom wall 
 Somebody cryin 
 Echoin 
 Down the hall 
 Never knew what it is to be a man 
 But now I know that I can 
 Its all here for you 
 And when you need me 
 You know that Im 
 Always here 
 Its not gonna be like 
 It ever was 
 Before my dear 
 Hard to believe the dyin words of a lyin man 
 But thats not me 
 Here I am 
 Its all here for youIn the waning days ahead 
 I gotta look back down the road 
 I know that its not too late 
 All the stupid things Ive said 
 And people Ive hurt and let down 
 I hope that its not my fate 
 To keep defeating my own self 
 And keep repeating yesterday 
 I cant keep defeating myself 
 I cant keep repeating the mistakes of my youth 
 In the dark of night I might 
 Be able to make myself think 
 That Im still a younger man 
 But when the light of day shines down 
 Theres no way to get around it 
 Im not the younger man 
 I keep defeating my own self 
 The choice is mine for making 
 A better road ahead 
 The road that Ive been taking 
 Headed for a deadend 
 But its not too late to turn around 
 In the final moments 
 I hope that I know that I tried 
 To do best I could 
 Stop defeating my own self 
 And stop repeating yesterday 
 I cant keep repeating the mistakes of my youthGoin over to Susans house 
 Walking south down Baxter Street 
 Nothin hidin behind this picket fence 
 Theres a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk 
 Where her house burnt down two years ago 
 People say back then she really wasnt that crazy 
 Goin over to Susans house 
 I cant be alone tonight 
 Down by the Donut Prince a 15 year old boy 
 Lies on the sidewalk with a bullet in his forehead 
 In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes 
 For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag 
 Meanwhile an old couple argues inside the Queen Bee 
 The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin 
 Shes gonna make it right 
 Take a left down Echo Park 
 A kid asked do I want some crack 
 TV sets are spewing 
 Baywatch 
 Through the windows into black 
 Here comes a girl with long brown hair 
 Who cant be more than 17 
 She sucks on a red popsicle 
 While she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage 
 And Im thinking 
 That must be her sister 
 That must be her sister right 
  
 They go into the 7Eleven 
 And I keep walking 
 I cant be alone to night 
 Goin over to Susans houseWake up the dying dont wake up the dead 
 Change what youre saying dont change what you said 
 Now that its time I got out of bed 
 And I walk myself down Sycamore Street 
 The sun beats down no shoes on my feet 
 And I stumble on a daisy through concrete 
 Pink and brown babies in pink stroller cars 
 They know that its good they dont care where they are 
 They know that home doesnt feel very far 
 Here we go 
 Oh yeah 
 Thats how I like it 
 Airplane is flying up in the sky 
 Making a pattern with the white lines 
 Looks like a heart or maybe a pie 
 A daisy through concrete22 miles of hard road 
 33 years of tough luck 
 44 skulls buried in the ground 
 Crawling down through the muck oh yeah 
 Johnny dont like the teacher 
 Johnny dont like the school 
 One day Johnny gonna do somethin 
 Show em hes nobodys fool oh yeah 
 Sisters brothers make better lovers 
 Family affairs now under the covers 
 Trailer park of broken hearts 
 Wont let you leave until youre bleeding 
 Sally dont like her daddy 
 Sally dont like her friends 
 Sally and Johnny watchin TV 
 Waitin for it to end oh yeah wooh 
 Wont let you leave until you rock 
 Waaaa whoo 
 Ha Ha Ha Ha Wha Ha Ha Ha Ha Woo 
 22 miles of hard road 
 Crawling down through the muck oh yeahLook at that picture on the wall 
 And what do you see 
 The eyes of a goat in a cowboy suit 
 Lookin like me 
 The attic is smoldering 
 The hallways bleed 
 And the basement is full of useless trinkets 
 That I dont need 
 I need you to know Im not insane 
 I know where I go Im not afraid 
 To leave behind a place like this 
 So if you need to look away 
 If you feel a little sick 
 You dont have to be afraid 
 Ill show you a trick 
 The porch is a rusty cage 
 The gardens a weed 
 To leave behind a place like thisThe sum of all your experiences 
 A living breathing result of the fight 
 And every night you spent shrouded in darkness 
 Has led you to this moment in the light its alright 
 Wonderful 
 Glorious 
 Ahh ahh ahh ah ah ah 
 The sum of all the love inside your heart 
 Will get you through your plight its alright 
 My love is beautiful its here for the taking 
 Its strong and pure and utterly earth shaking 
 My love has brought me here to show you its true 
 A wretch like me youll make it throughCant say I know what will happen tomorrow 
 I cant say I know if its joy or sorrow 
 I cant say how long Ill stand at the line that Im towing 
 But Ive got a good feeling bout where Im going 
 All you see a world so full of need 
 And all I need is a pocket full of seeds 
 Sunflowers shooting up to a sky that is glowing 
 And Ive got a good feeling bout where Im going 
 Prayed for rain it might not come 
 Cant save the day save someone 
 I cant say if the flowers will keep on growing 
 But Ive got a good feeling about where Im goingI dont miss where I came from 
 But each night I dream about being back home 
 When I wake up in the morning 
 Im too tired too tired of being alone 
 So I get up and go downtown 
 And pick me out a little piece of ground 
 Where I can prove something to the world 
 I can prove something to the world 
 Dont look at me 
 Im the bus stop boxer 
 Daddy put us in the truck and 
 Dropped us off and said good luck and 
 One lucky kid waiting for the bus 
 Made a winner out of one of us 
 Goin down by the railroad trackd 
 Where people know theyd better not relax 
 Im the man baby I am the man 
 This is where I can make you understand 
 Dont look at meYour mama warned you she was probably right 
 Said I be trouble all day and all night 
 She said my kind is not to take an old kind 
 She told them better was out there to find 
 Your mama warned you and she doesnt needs words 
 A life with him high thats for the birds 
 She said you listen and you take it from me 
 You just cant be what he needin to be 
 But you cant believe everything she says 
 Theres a home called heaven within my head 
 You know that I mean well 
 Your mama warned you with an arrogant tone 
 Dont be a fool girl leave him alone 
 She so superior and so she just think 
 But I dont trust someone whos eyes never blink 
 No you cant believe everything she says 
 All the things shell never understand 
 Ill know shell never be a fan 
 But shes not you 
 Your mama warned you she was probably right 
 And you cant believe everything she says 
 Your mama warned youI had a date with a pretty ballerina 
 Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes 
 I asked her for this dance 
 And then she obliged me 
 Was I surprised yeah 
 Was I surprised 
 No not at all 
 I called her yesterday 
 It should have been tomorrow 
 I could not keep 
 The joy that was inside 
 I begged for her to tell me 
 If she really loved me 
 Somewhere a mountain is moving 
 Afraid its moving without me 
 I had a date with a pretty ballerina 
 Was I surprised no not at all 
 And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning 
 I open up my eyes to find theres rain 
 And something strange within said 
 Go ahead and find her 
 Just close your eyes yeah 
 Just close your eyes and shell be there 
 Shell be thereI know Im not too much of a bargain 
 And you know thats not what you bargained for 
 As the hours turn into days 
 Pretty soon lost in the haze 
 Its up to you and me and whos to say 
 These could be the good old days 
 I like waking up after a bad dream 
 Makes it feel like life aint bad 
 Little kids go out to play 
 Theyre just happy its another day 
 I guess I could be a quiet hero 
 No one knows the good Ive done 
 Youre not sure well thats okay 
 Cause I am and Im not afraid 
 These could be the good old daysIn this world of shit 
 Baby you are it 
 A little light that shines all over 
 Must take over and see us through the night 
 Daddy was a troubled genius 
 Mama was a real good egg 
 Why dont we just get together 
 For whatever and see if its all right 
 I spent so many days just starin at the haze 
 I think thats a book that I dont have to write again 
 And when I rise I shine Ive got you on my mind 
 And the question isnt if the question is merely when 
 Baby I confess 
 I am quite a mess 
 So lets get married and make some people 
 More than equal in this world of shit 
 I will make a pledge 
 To get down off the ledge 
 You and I belong together 
 And forever we will have our lifeSaturday Morning 
 Whos gonna play with me 
 Six in the morning baby 
 I got a long long day ahead of me 
 The parents are sleeping soundly 
 The neighbors are dead as wood 
 Im getting up and coming over 
 We gotta rock the neighborhood 
 Nothings ever gonna happen round here 
 If we dont make it happen 
 Sleep away the day if you want to 
 But I got something that I gotta do 
 Its Saturday Morning 
 And this aint the place for me 
 Im giving you warning baby 
 We got a whole big fat world to see 
 And whos gonna play with me 
 Saturday morning 
 Saturday morningShe has eyes disability blue 
 A German dog and strict curfew 
 And if one mans cage is another mans stage 
 Then shes turned the script to another page 
 And she doesnt really give a damn 
 What you have to say 
 She makes a call on her friends cell phone 
 The operator answers and says Youre not alone 
 And if one mans ceiling is anothers dance floor 
 Then shell be the one running to the sea shore 
 Trying to tell the seagulls 
 This is home 
 Then shell be the one wiser than her age 
 Trying to get the message to your earEveryone loves you 
 Nobody cares 
 An awful collection 
 Of enemies and friends 
 Congratulations to you 
 With sad regrets 
 Im tired of the old shit 
 Let the new shit begin 
 The psychic pain 
 Of living in this world 
 Its overwhelming me 
 Again and again 
 A beautiful afternoon 
 Inside you in your bed 
 Nobody loves you 
 Everyone cares 
 None of them know whats 
 Coming round the bend 
 Congratulations to me 
 Many happy returns 
 Let the new shit beginThe smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky 
 The load on the road brings a tear to the indians eye 
 The ringmasters Telecaster sings on an empty stage 
 Uhhuh goddamn right its a beautiful day 
 Uhhuh 
 The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair 
 Shes crawlin out her window cause her daddy just dont care 
 Come on 
 The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair 
 Finger on the trigger let me tell you it is quite a scare 
 The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound 
 My neighbor digs the flavor still hes moving to another town 
 And I dont know how youre taking all the shit you see 
 You dont believe anyone but most of all dont believe me 
 Only you 
 only you 
 UhhuhIt was late had some drinks 
 A 200 TattooWhen you called 
 Your voice was so grave 
 I knew it would be 
 The last time we spoke 
 You said something 
 That I could not bear 
 To hear with my own ears 
 And its a hard time 
 Trying to get through 
 All the days that drag on 
 Thinking about you 
 Nothing hurts 
 Like someone who knows 
 Everything about you 
 Leaving you behind 
 When you called 
 You might as well have killed me 
 And that was the last time 
 The last time we spokeSee this watch she gave me 
 Well it still ticks away 
 The days Im claiming back for me 
 The medications wearing off 
 Gonna hurt not a little a lot 
 Keep on tickin youre not lickin me 
 Step on a crack break your mothers heart 
 Red light green light black 
 Suicide email do not delete 
 Plug it back in the jack 
 Start to be what they want you to be 
 And you see yourself as they see you 
 Sunrise at the corner of Sunset and Alvarado 
 I think 
 What the hell do I do now 
 Watch the day disintegrate 
 So I can stay up late and wait 
 See this watch she gave me 
 Well it still ticks awayShe’s got her life living in her heart 
 She’s got these eyes well where do I start 
 Like looking at the deep night sky 
 So many worlds inside her eyes 
 She’s a spectacular girl 
 Part of the job of being a man 
 Is knowing when to let go of her hand 
 A kind of power it can’t be reined in 
 To hold her back would be a sin 
 She sees the beauty in things we all miss 
 All good things are defined by the kiss 
 If you feeling like you can’t believe 
 Well then how do you explain the miracle I see 
 Spectacular girl 
 Not a desire and not a need 
 Some things just happen because they have to be 
 I’m gonna get there I’m telling you sir 
 I’m a man on a mission and I’m all about her 
 My loveBlinking lights on the airplane wings 
 Up above the trees 
 Blinking down a morse code signal 
 Especially for me 
 Aint no rainbow in the sky 
 But the signals coming through 
 One day I will be alright again 
 Blinking lights on the highway cars 
 Stopping one by one 
 Get a look at the accident 
 Didnt see that one coming 
 And the doctor in the sky 
 Gonna bring his chopper down 
 Gonna bring me out alive 
 And set me on the ground once more again 
 Blinking lights on the airplane wings 
 Up above the treesDo you know what its like to fall on the floor 
 Cry your guts out till you got no more 
 Hey man now youre really livin 
 Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl 
 Made you feel like its not such a bad world 
 Now youre really giving everything 
 And youre really getting all you gave 
 Now youre really livin what this life is all about 
 Well I just saw the sun rise over the hill 
 Never used to give me much of a thrill hey 
 But hey man now Im really livin 
 Do you know what its like to care too much 
 Bout someone that youre never gonna get to touch 
 Have you ever sat down in the freshcut grass hey 
 And thought about the moment and when it will pass hey 
 Now youre really givin everything 
 And youre really gettin all you gave 
 Now what would you say if I told you that 
 Everyone thinks youre a crazy old cat 
 Hey man now youre really living

 Hey Hey man now youre really living

 Hey man now Im really living 
 People hey hey 
 HeyCrazy guy with a matted beard 
 Standing on the corner 
 Shouting out end times are near 
 And nobody notices 
 But I can hear him loud and clear 
 She is gone now and nowhere near 
 Seems like end times are here 
 I walk around a puddle in the street 
 And head on home 
 Outside my window theres a cat in heat 
 Shut up cat and leave me alone 
 There aint no heat around here 
 I dont feel nothing now not even fear 
 Now that end times are here 
 Now everyones crazy theyve lost their minds 
 Just look at the world 
 It could all be over at any old time 
 And I can hear it loud and clear 
 The world is ending and what do I care 
 Shes gone end times are hereLookin downtown sunriser sam 
 Bring it on down now im in a jam 
 Where did you find such a rockin vest 
 So get away kid youve become a pest 
 Heaven cant help a teenage witch 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditch 
 Silky gown 
 Pink and brown 
 Shut you down 
 And shut you up 
 Little lizard legs and rubber lizard tails 
 Always taste better when youre sittin in jail 
 Still I dont think that I can resist 
 After all the times that I had to kiss 
 Keep at arms length from the long armed law 
 Goin to the bank for a 50 withdrawl 
 Gonna find the place where the weirdos hang 
 Knockin on the door for a 50 bang 
 From sinking deeper down into the ditchA knock on the door means 
 Hello Jesus calls 
 A ring on the phone means 
 A trip to Niagara Falls 
 Daddy dont let me down this time 
 Im all alone inside my mind 
 And its no small thing 
 That I must prove to you 
 A late night card game 
 With the guys is alright 
 But I would rather take you 
 For a test drive 
 While I look out 
 On the passing fields 
 The sun through the bugs 
 On the windshield 
 Makes me feel like I dont matter 
 A knock on the door means 
 A trip to Niagara FallsGoing to your funeral and feeling I could scream 
 Everything goes away 
 Driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream 
 A perfect day for perfect pain 
 Look at all the people with the flowers in their hands 
 They put the flower on the box thats holding all the sand 
 That was 
 That was once 
 That was once you 
 Honolulu hurricane I knew that you were not insane 
 Living in the insane world 
 Smiling like its no big deal scabby wounds that never heal 
 The woman was only a girl 
 Look at all the people with their heads down in their hands 
 When everything Im feeling makes it hard to understand 
 That what what I need to miss its 
 Its what I need to miss is you 
 Going to your funeral and Im feeling like a fool 
 No ones gonna take the blame 
 Thinking about the days of hanging out behind the school 
 Everything goes awayIf I lay my head down 
 I will see you in my dream 
 Wearing that polkadot dress 
 And sitting by the stream 
 Leaning in to hear you 
 You will whisper in my ear 
 And everything I need to know 
 I finally hear 
 I wish I could remember 
 But my selective memory wont let me 
 When I was a baby 
 We would go out to the park 
 And sit out in the fountain 
 Splashing round until its dark 
 The days go on forever 
 When you only know that much 
 And everything you need to know 
 Is answered with one touch 
 I wish could remember 
 But my selective memory wont let meGoing over to Susans house 
 Nothing hiding behind this picket fence 
 People say that back then she really wasnt that crazy 
 Going over to Susans house 
 Susans house 
 Down by the Donut Prince a fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk 
 With a bullet in his forehead 
 Meanwhile and old couple argues inside the Queen Bee 
 A kid asks do I want some crack 
 TV sets are spewing Baywatch 
 Who cant be more than seventeen 
 She sucks on a red popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage 
 And Im thinking that must be her sister 
 They go into the 711 and I keep walking 
 Susans houseNobodys quite sure how it became 
 But something so good could become of this day 
 But shes like a dream where youve lost all your fear 
 And in this life youre lucky 
 To have even one good friend 
 And its her that Ill miss in the end 
 Love stories come and then love stories go 
 But this is the one that Ill always know 
 She is the one that makes me believe 
 And in this life youve got yourself 
 On which you can depend 
 But its her that Ill miss in the end 
 Yeah its her that Ill miss in the end 
 Love is a word that gets thrown round a lot 
 Sometimes it means something other times not 
 But she is the greatest love Ill ever know 
 And in this life youll never know 
 Whats waiting round the bend 
 Its her that Ill miss in the endI feel like an old railroad man 
 Ridin out on the bluemont line 
 Hummin along old dominion blues 
 Not much to see and not much left to lose 
 And I know I can walk along the tracks 
 It may take a little longer 
 But Ill know how to find my way back 
 I feel like an old railroad man 
 Whos really tried the best that he can 
 To make his life add up to something good 
 But this engine no longer burns on wood 
 And I guess I may never understand 
 The times that I live in 
 Are not made for a railroad man 
 Getting on board at the end of an age 
 The stations empty and the whistle blows 
 Things are faster now and this train is just too slow 
 But Ill know how to find my way backComin through the alley tryin to walk without a sound 
 It doesnt really matter cause there aint no one around 
 Tiptoe through the alley and tiptoe through your life 
 You still got it coming be it gun be it knife 
 Next thing you know 
 Youre eating hospital food 
 Karaoke castration take the wasp alive 
 Hes gonna sting you anyway and take you to the hive 
 Yesterday was suckin and tomorrows lookin bad 
 Who knew that today was the only thing I had 
 What What I can hear you I was uh 
 Hospital food 
 Want some hospital food 
 Delicious hospital food 
 In your tribute album to the world you must never forget 
 To sing the one about the cat whos always gettin wet 
 Hes always got a problem hes a very bitter dude 
 And now hes complaining bout his hospital food 
 Its gonna help the medicine go down 
 Gonna take a walk without a sound 
 A little hospital food 
 Helps the spoonful of sugar come up 
 I want some hospital food 
 In your blender and in my cup 
 Hospital foodIn my younger days 
 This wouldnt have been so hard 
 I wouldve just shrugged it off 
 But now its tough 
 Im not so rough 
 Ive got a little ways to go 
 Its not over yet I know 
 But it feels 
 Not so far away 
 In my younger days 
 This still wouldve knocked me down 
 But I wouldve just bounced right back you know 
 Now Im a statistic 
 But Im not fatalistic 
 Im not yet resigned to fate 
 And Im not gonna be ruled by hate 
 But its strong 
 And its filling up my days 
 I wouldve just chalked it up 
 As part of my ongoing education 
 But Ive had enough 
 Been through some stuff 
 And I dont need any more misery 
 To teach me what I should be 
 I just need you backWhat is this note 
 The sun kisses the morning dew 
 Just the way that Im kissing you 
 The birds are tweeting in sweet harmony 
 Teaching the free world how to be free 
 The day is new and a good one too 
 How can I prove my love to you 
 I wanna give you everything 
 Me and the birds now were gonna sing 
 When I wake up to your beautiful smile 
 Sometimes it takes me a little while 
 To realize that I am awake 
 And that living today will be a piece of cake 
 And I wont keep you for myself 
 No youre not a toy on my shelf 
 The world needs to know that youre here 
 So spread your wings and fly my dear 
 Me and the birds now were gonna singYoure dead but the world keeps spinning 
 Take a spin through the world you left 
 Its getting dark a little too early 
 Are you missing the dearly bereft 
 Taking flight and you could be here tomorrow 
 Taking flight well you could get here tonight 
 Im gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town 
 What 
 Im gonna fly on down then fly away 
 Well alright 
 Get down 
 Takin a spin throught the neighbourhood 
 The neighbours scream 
 Whatchya talkin bout 
 Cause they dont know how to let you in 
 And I cant let you out 
 What if I was not your only friend in this world 
 Can you take me where youre going if youre never coming back 
 Im gonna fly on down then fly away on my way 
 Why dont we take a ride away up high through the neighbourhood 
 Up over the billboards and the factories and smoke 
 Fly away 
 Get downI need some sleep I cant go on like this 
 I tried counting sheep but theres one I always miss 
 Everyone says Im getting down too low 
 Everyone says you just gotta let it go 
 You just gotta let it go 
 I need some sleep time to put the old horse down 
 Im in too deep and the wheels keep spinnin round 
 Just gotta let it goSo I wrote it all in a letter 
 I dont know if it came 
 The nurse she likes my writing 
 So she keeps it just like me 
 So that it wont get away 
 I wont be denied this time 
 Before I go out of my mind 
 Over matters got my foot on the ladder 
 And Im climbing up to the moon 
 Got a sky that looks like Heaven 
 Got an Earth that looks like shit 
 Its getting hard to tell where 
 What I am ends and what theyre making me begins 
 And I wont be denied this time 
 Saturday in the yard 
 Theyll bring you by 
 Well lay down on the grass 
 And watch as the sky closes in 
 Climbing up to the moonTheres a world outside 
 And I know cause Ive heard talk 
 In my sweetest dream 
 I would go out for a walk 
 But I dont think Im ready yet 
 Not feelin up to it now 
 Just not that steady yet 
 And I dont need you telling me how 
 Theres some happiness 
 If my stone face cracks again 
 Maybe some time sooner or later 
 Im not feelin up to it now 
 So if I leave my room 
 Dont you tell me to lighten up 
 I dont need you telling me how 
 I dont dont need you telling me howDear cousin I got your letter 
 It was more than I thought I deserved 
 Well she sounds perfect all I dream of 
 And I dream about so much it is absurd 
 But when I get there and she sees me 
 Ill be impressed if she does not run screaming 
 My kind of love is an ugly love 
 But its real and it lasts a long long time 
 I had a thought while I was sleeping 
 And I dreamed about a place for us to rest 
 Eternity under the old oak tree 
 But I go too far i guess 
 Maybe Ill think about tomorrow 
 And maybe I can get her to stay that long 
 Cause my kind of love is an ugly love 
 And if she finds me so repulsive 
 She wouldnt be the first to wretch 
 Well I decided one day long ago 
 I was never gonna be the greatest catch 
 And if she cares about the car I drive 
 Then she can get in hers the moment I arrive 
 But its real and it lasts a long long timeI never thought that I could be so bold 
 To even say these thoughts aloud 
 I see you with your man your eyes just shine 
 While he stands tall and walking proud 
 That look you give that guy 
 I wanna see looking right at me 
 If I could be that guy instead of me 
 Id never let you down 
 It always seems like youre going somewhere 
 Better than youve been before 
 While I go to sleep and I dream all night 
 Of you knocking on my door 
 Id be all I can be 
 Im nothing like what Id like to be 
 Im nothing much I know its true 
 I lack the style and the pedigree 
 And my chances are so few 
 Id give you all I got 
 I never thought that I could be so bold 
 But if lets say it wont work out 
 You know where I can be found 
 Id never let you downHow does a little baby know how to smile 
 How does a cat land on his feet 
 Why does it feel like youve been here before 
 How do the two perfect people meet 
 Pain in my heart twistin like a knife 
 Disappeared just overnight 
 Good morning mystery of life 
 La la la la 
 La la la la la 
 How does a mother wake up in the night 
 When she knows her daughters sad 
 On the other side of the earth 
 How does she know the kind of day shes had 
 Ghosts flyin all around my life 
 Sent a message both bold and bright 
 How does a man lose all that he loves 
 And find the strength to rise above 
 Havin nothing to call his own 
 How does he find that he still has love 
 No more sorrow no more strife 
 Always some daylight followin the night 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la laMama gripped onto the milkmans hand 
 And then she finally gave birth 
 Years go by still I dont know 
 Who shall inherit this earth 
 And no one will know my name until its on a stone 
 Woah 
 This could be your lucky day in hell 
 Never know who it might be at your doorbell 
 This could be your lucky day in hell in hell 
 Waking up with an ugly face 
 Winston Churchill in drag 
 Looking for new maternal embrace 
 Another tired old gag 
 Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones 
 Father Theresa you cant make me into you 
 I never wanna be like you 
 Why cant you see its me 
 You know its time to let me go 
 This could be your lucky day in hell in hell in hell 
 Never know who it might be at your doorbell in hell 
 In hell in hellIm so bored I wanna get in trouble 
 Buried alive beneath my lifes rubble 
 Ill tell you whats really making me sad 
 Youre disinterest is driving me mad 
 Youre so fine 
 If you were mine Id love you up 
 Give me a sign my darling 
 Well I can shine if youd just let me know 
 Whats a fella gotta do 
 To spend a little time with you 
 Im so tired of feeling I could be more 
 I need a purpose what am I for 
 What Id like after close inspection 
 Is for you to look in my direction 
 Well I can shine if youd just give it up 
 Im so bored Id welcome a disaster 
 Anything to make the heart beat faster 
 But I got a feeling we could be so right 
 Make my day Ill make your night 
 youre so fine 
 if you were mine 
 give me a sign 
 well I can shine 
 Im so bored I wanna get in trouble 
 Is for you to look in my directionShe put on her party dress 
 I put on my jacket and walked out the door 
 Didnt have nowhere to go 
 Didnt matter that the night was getting cold 
 Pulled her closer to me 
 To keep her warm 
 And everything was beautiful and free 
 In the beginning 
 She woke up late in the morning 
 I pulled the curtain back the sun came pouring in 
 Wasnt no one in the world 
 Wasnt nothing else just me and my girl 
 She put her arms around me 
 Gave me a kiss 
 In the beginningLife is hard and so am I 
 Youd better give me something so I dont die 
 Novocaine for the soul 
 Life is white and I am black 
 Jesus and his lawyer are coming back 
 Oh my darling will you be here 
 Guess whos living here with the great undead 
 This paintbynumbers life is fucking with my head 
 Once again 
 Life is good and I feel great 
 Cause mother says I was a great mistake 
 Youd better give me something to fill the hole 
 Before I sputter outWell its a pretty bad place outside this door 
 I could go out there but I dont see what for 
 And Im happy living here in the dark 
 On the edge of my mind 
 And its nobody elses business 
 Now its just me myself I and the secrets that live within the walls 
 Of the mansions of los feliz 
 Well the citys on fire you can smell the flesh 
 And the screams like dogs in the wilderness 
 And where all the poor souls go 
 Looking to mend their hearts 
 Like its everyone elses business 
 And at best theyll find the secrets that live within the walls 
 Well hes gone out again and left you all alone 
 Come on over Im always home 
 And where do the poor souls go 
 Well I do mean to make it my business 
 And its just me myself and the secrets that live within the walls 
 Of the mansions of los felizFeeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time yes I am 
 Feeling mighty fine 
 Feeling mighty fine at this time yes indeed 
 Walk down any street 
 Pass the people you meet 
 What is it about this place that keeps you on your feet 
 Night is coming down 
 Closer to the ground 
 Gonna have a little fun while Im still around 
 Dont believe the words they say to you 
 When they are so absurd 
 Dont believe a word they say about me 
 Because Im feeling mighty fine 
 Think I gotta go 
 Think Im gonna die 
 Oh my God somethings wrong 
 The end is coming near because Im 
 feeling mighty fine at this time yes I am 
 Yes I amSpunky dont like her uniform 
 It never fit so good 
 Goin back to the orphanage 
 And the place where her garage once stood 
 Well its a free for all free for all free for all 
 Its a free for all you and me 
 And if you dont like what theyre telling you 
 You cant teach a blind man to see 
 Well I can see 
 Spunky looks good in her bright red wig 
 Eating chocolatechip mint ice cream 
 A cat named Lola with a violent past 
 Is balled up asleep cross her knees 
 And its a free for all free for all free for all 
 One day the world will be ready for you 
 And wonder how they didnt see 
 Spunky knows she can save the world 
 In her own little way 
 Turning in her old uniform 
 Cause you know it really didnt pay 
 Cause its a free for all free for all free for all 
 I walk through the world with your name on my tongue 
 And your picture etched on my screenShe hides in the library reading 
 Henry Miller 
 books 
 Till they flash the lights its time to go 
 When she was a little kid she said 
 Dad I dont know why I feel so penniless inside 
 Shes on the promenade 
 Shes looking for a dress 
 Shes locked outside a world 
 Just a Manchester girl 
 Oh Ill meet you there by the old newsstand 
 Oh Ill meet you there tonight 
 Shoot out at the neighbors house 
 She pulls the covers over her head 
 Shes counting the shots as they go by 
 In Pandoras litter box 
 Well its getting mighty high 
 That cats gonna keep her up at night 
 Another scary dream 
 Another cigarette 
 Oh Ill meet you there tonightIve got your picture 
 And your black book 
 Smells like your perfume 
 On the walks that we took 
 And I love you 
 And you love me 
 But were apart 
 Cause I read 
 The cheaters guide to your heart 
 Think of it this way 
 It was never meant to be I guess 
 But know at the end of 
 The day I felt blessed 
 Well it may be long till you see me again 
 So paint me as a good one my friend 
 The cheaters guide to your heartDont cry 
 All the songs you sing 
 All the flowers you bring 
 Are part of everything there ever was 
 And will be 
 Go on 
 Youve got places to be 
 So many things to see 
 Dont worry about me 
 Im already where I should be 
 Look up 
 A plane writes in the sky 
 For every passer by 
 No one ever dies 
 They just write things in the sky 
 If you 
 Wanna think about me 
 Look out above the sea 
 And you can see that I am doing 
 Just fineFish in the sea you know how I feel 
 River runnin free you know how I feel 
 Blossom on the tree you know how I feel 
 Its a new dawn 
 Its a new day 
 Its a new life for me 
 And Im feeling good 
 Dragonfly in the sun you know what I mean 
 Butterflies all havin fun you know what I mean 
 Sleepin peace when days done thats what I mean 
 And this whole world 
 Is a new world 
 And a gold world for me 
 Stars when you shine you know how I feel 
 Scent of the pine you know how I feel

 To your long list of estranged friends 
 Youre pushin through the limit 
 And I may not be here for you again 
 I think you oughta know by now 
 That I do believe in you 
 Theres really no good reason why 
 It all has to be through 
 Youre hidin in the basement 
 Youre hidin in the dust 
 Your heart is full of venom 
 And your veins are full of rust 
 If I told you what its like out here 
 Could you take me at my word 
 The sun is shinin the birds are singin soft 
 Or havent you heard 
 To your long list of estranged friendsFlying through the dark 
 Dead reckoning 
 My gauges cant be trusted 
 Cant see a goddamn thing 
 I know the day is coming 
 That catches up with me 
 I told you youre no match 
 But then who could be 
 Thought we were the lonely type 
 On an island of the lost 
 But it was only me 
 Because you got lost 
 I cant change you 
 I cant change anyoneI am building a shrine 
 Deep inside my heart 
 It’s filled with all the little things 
 I’ll take when I depart 
 All the love you bring me 
 All the tender words you sing me 
 And all the suns within your smile 
 All the wisdom of your ways 
 Enduring endless days 
 And all the love that never dies 
 Deep down in the cold ground 
 Such a sad place to be 
 But Ill be fine with all the little things 
 That I’m taking with me 
 And all the love that never diesRecord company hates me 
 The doctor says Im sick 
 The bad girls think Im just too nice 
 And the nice girls call me dick 
 But Baby loves me 
 And shes smarter than you 
 My baby loves me 
 Unlikely but true 
 Policeman flashes the red lights 
 Coach says that Im weak 
 Teacher says Im not too bright 
 Bodybuilder calls me pipsqueak 
 The neighbors dont like my flowers 
 The waiter dont like my tip 
 The librarian shushes me 
 Travel agent canceled my trip 
 Baby loves me 
 Minister says Im a demon 
 Dietitian says Im a pig 
 Warmhearted say Im freezin 
 Promoter wont give me the gig 
 My tired body is breakin down 
 The world is endin soon 
 Its all crumblin at my feet 
 Not sure what to do 
 And thats a real good thing 
 Its a beautiful thing 
 Baby loves meThats the bell and Im gonna be late 
 Like I really give a shit 
 Dont expect me to relate when your 
 Holier than thou 
 Thirteen 
 Gonna take them there too 
 Know one else can understand when your 
  Says I gotta calm down 
 And learn to look the other way 
 He says Im lost but Im gonna be found he said 
  And I dont relate 
 Remember when I was a baby 
 And I was happy just to breathe I was
