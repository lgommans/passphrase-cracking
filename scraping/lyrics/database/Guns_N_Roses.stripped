Well shes all geared up walking down the street 
 And I can feel the slime dripping down her sleeve 
 Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes going to do 2x 
 Well its late at night and Im all alone 
 And I can hear her boots as shes near her home 
 Scratch scratch shes clawing at the door 
 Whoa no I cant take it anymore 
 Crack crack Im feeling so sore 
 I never should asked for black leather 
 Black leather 
 Ooh black leather 
 Ow black leather 
 And you can try to hide but you wont get far 
 You can let her in and youll start again 
 Black leatherAll I need is some inspiration 
 Before I do somebody some harm 
 I feel just like a vegetable 
 Down here on the farm 
 Nobody comes to see me 
 Nobody here to turn me on 
 I aint even got a lover 
 They told me to get healthy 
 They told me to get some sun 
 But boredom eats me like catsup 
 Drinking lemonade shanty 
 Aint no body gonna do me harm 
 But Im like a fish out of water 
 I write a thousand letters 
 Till my fingers all gone numb 
 But I never see no postman 
 I call my baby on the telephone 
 I say come down and have some fun 
 But she knows what the score is 
 I cant fall in love with a wheat field 
 I cant fall in love with a barn 
 When everything smells like horse shit 
 Blue skies and swimming pools 
 Add so much charm 
 But Id rather be back in Soho 
 Than down here on the farm 
 On the fucking farm 
 Are you born in a fucking barn or what 
 BaaaaaaDont you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Dont you try to stop us now 
 Cause I just wont let you 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 The world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with 
 An endless monotony 
 Theres nothing thats stopping me 
 All things are possible 
 I am unstoppable 
 Some may convince you 
 No one can break through 
 Im here to tell you 
 Youre worth more than they tell you 
 My lifes a catastrophe 
 Cant understand why 
 It seems like it has to be 
 Its all opened up for me 
 Nothings impossible 
 I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you 
 Do what they want to 
 You know youre stronger 
 Than the lies that they tell you 
 Id give anything to know 
 I would have never made it so far 
 How you live with yourself 
 All by myself 
 Believe in yourselfDont damn me 
 When I speak a piece of my mind 
 Cause silence isnt golden 
 When Im holding it inside 
 Cause Ive been where I have been 
 And Ive seen what I have seen 
 I put the pen to the paper 
 Cause its all a part of me 
 Be it a song or casual conversation 
 To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations 
 Your words once heard they can place you in a faction 
 My words may disturb but at least theres a reaction 
 Sometimes I wanna kill 
 Sometimes I wanna die 
 Sometimes I wanna destroy 
 Sometimes I wanna cry 
 Sometimes I could get even 
 Sometimes I could give up 
 Sometimes I could give 
 Sometimes I never give a fuck 
 Its only for a while 
 I hope you understand 
 I never wanted this to happen 
 Didnt want to be a man 
 So I hid inside my world 
 I took what I could find 
 I cried when I was lonely 
 I fell down when I was blind 
 But dont damn me 
 An Ive seen what I have seen 
 How can I ever satisfy you 
 And how can I ever make you see 
 That deep inside were all somebody 
 And it dont matter who you wanna be 
 But now I gotta smile 
 I hope you comprehend 
 For this man can say it happened 
 Cause this child has been condemned 
 So I stepped into your world 
 I kicked you in the mind 
 And Im the only witness 
 To the nature of my crime 
 But look at what weve done 
 To the innocent and young 
 Whoa listen to whos talking 
 Cause were not the only ones 
 The trash collected by the eyes 
 And dumped into the brain 
 Said it tears into our conscious thoughts 
 You tell me whos to blame 
 I know you dont wanna hear me cryin 
 And I know you dont wanna hear me deny 
 That your satisfaction lies in your illusions 
 But your delusions are yours and not mine 
 We take for granted we know the whole story 
 We judge a book by its cover and read what we want 
 Between selected lines 
 Dont hail me 
 And dont idolize the ink 
 Or Ive failed in my intentions 
 Can you find the missing link 
 Your only validation 
 Is living your own life 
 Vicarious existence 
 Is a fucking waste of time 
 So I send this song to the offended 
 I said what I meant and Ive never pretended 
 As so many others do intending just to please 
 If I damned your point of view could you turn the other cheek 
 Dont damn me 
 I said dont damn me 
 I said dont hail me 
 Smoke em if you got em 
 Alright that suckedOh 
 Dont you try and stop us now 
 Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with an endless monotony 
 Sometimes I feel like theres nothing thats stopping me 
 All things are possible I am unstoppable 
 So they convince you no one can break through 
 Im here to tell you youre worth more than they tell you 
 Sometimes I feel like my lifes a catastrophe 
 Cant understand why it seems like it has to be 
 Sometimes I feel like its all opened up for me 
 Nothings impossible I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you do what they want to 
 You know youre stronger than the lies that they tell you 
 Believe in yourselfI got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I said I dont know what I did 
 But I know I gotta move 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 I cant wait here forever 
 I got too much here to lose 
 An now youre blowin smoke 
 I think youre one big joke 
 Me I gotta lot to learn 
 And Im still waitin for the heads to turn 
 You say I walk a line 
 Fuck they move it every time 
 You walk a mile in my shoes 
 And then you tell me bout singin the blues 
 Oh you get what you pay for 
 And freedoms real high priced 
 And while your rippin off children 
 Somebodys fuckin your wife 
 Its never made a difference 
 Its only how you survive 
 And now you ask me why 
 I said its do or die 
 Ill stick it right in your face 
 And then Ill put you in your motherfuckin place 
 And you you can suck my ass 
 I think its so low class 
 Me Im just so concerned 
 Im still waitin for your ass to burn 
 Oh you want a confrontation 
 Ill give you every fuckin chance 
 With your verbal masturbation 
 Me I just like to dance 
 Hows that for provocation 
 Im just makin a stance 
 And Im tired of the frustration 
 Of livin inside of your lies 
 And Im wired on indignation 
 I said somebodys got to die 
 Listen motherfucker 
 Youre about to pay your dues 
 If youre goin up against me 
 Dont you know youre gonna lose 
 I know 
 You think anyone with an IQ over 15 would believe your shit Fuckhead 
 Nothin but a fuckin pussyIts all the same only the names will change 
 Everyday it seems were wasting away 
 Another place where the faces are so cold 
 Id drive all night just to get back home 
 Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride 
 Im wanted dead or alive 
 Wanted dead or alive 
 Sometimes I sleep sometimes its not for days 
 And the people I meet always go their separate ways 
 Sometimes you tell the day 
 By the bottle that you drink 
 And times when youre alone all you do is think 
 Im wanted wanted dead or alive 
 Wanted wanted dead or alive 
 And I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back 
 I play for keeps cause I might not make it back 
 Ive been everywhere oh yeah still Im standing tall 
 Ive seen a million faces and Ive rocked them all 
 Cause Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride 
 And Im a cowboy I got the night on my side 
 And Im wanted wanted dead or alive 
 And Im right and Im right dead or alive 
 I still drive I still drive dead or alive 
 Dead or alive 
 Dead or aliveIm your top prime cut of meat Im your choice 
 I wanna be elected 
 Im your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce 
 Kids want a savior dont need a fake 
 Were all gonna rock to the rules that I make 
 I wanna be elected elected elected 
 Good evening Mr  Mrs America and all ships at sea 
 The candidate is taking the country by storm 
 I never lied to you Ive always been cool 
 I gotta get the vote and I told you bout school 
 I wanna be elected elected elected 
 Hallelujah I wanna be selected 
 Everyone in the United States of America 
 Were gonna win this one take the country by storm

 You and me together young and strong 
 Were gonna be elected elected elected 
 Respected selected call collected 
 I wanna be elected elected 
 And if I am elected 
 I promise the formation of a new party 
 A third party the Wild Party 
 I know we have problems 
 We got problems right here in Central City 
 We have problems on the North South East and West 
 New York City Saint Louis Philadelphia Los Angeles Detroit Chicago 
 Everybody has problems 
 And personally I dont careIts a critical solution 
 And the east coast got the blues 
 Its a mass of confusion 
 Like the lies they sell to you 
 You got a glass jawed toothache 
 Of a mental disease 
 An they be runnin round back 
 See em line up on their knees 
 Cause the kiss ass sycophants 
 Throwin penance at your feet 
 When they got nowhere to go 
 Watch em come in off the streets 
 While theyre bangin out front 
 Inside their slammin to the crutch 
 Go on an throw me to the lions 
 And the whole damn screamin bunch 
 Cause the pissedoff ripoffs 
 R everywhere you turn 
 Tell me how a generations 
 Ever sposed to learn 
 This fire is burnin 
 And its out of control 
 Its not a problem you can stop 
 Its rock n roll 
 I read it on a wall 
 It went straight to my head 
 It said Dance to the tension 
 of a world on edge 
 We got racial violence 
 And wholl cast the first stone 
 And sex is used anyway it can be 
 Sometimes when I look out 
 Its hard to see the day 
 Its a feelin you can have it 
 Its not mine to take away 
 Lost in the garden of Eden 
 Said were lost in the garden of Eden 
 And theres no ones gonna believe this 
 But were lost in the garden of Eden 
 Suck on that 
 Looking through this point of view 
 Theres no way Im gonna fit in 
 Dont ya tell me what my eyes see 
 Dont ya tell me who to believe in 
 I aint superstitious 
 But I know when somethings wrong 
 Ive been draggin my heels 
 With a bitch called hope 
 Let the undercurrent drag me along 
 Most organized religions make 
 A mockery of humanity 
 Our governments are dangerous 
 And out of control 
 The garden of Eden is just another graveyard 
 Said if they had someone to buy it 
 Said Im sure theyd sell my soul 
 An we aint talkin about no poison apple or some missin rib ya hear 
 Its rock n rollShes got a smile that it seems to me 
 Reminds me of childhood memories 
 Where everything was as fresh 
 As the bright blue sky 
 Now and then when I see her face 
 She takes me away to that special place 
 And if I stare too long 
 Id probably break down and cry 
 Woah oh oh sweet child o mine 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet love of mine 
 Shes got eyes of the bluest skies 
 And if they thought of rain 
 Id hate to look into those eyes 
 And see an ounce of pain 
 Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
 Where as a child Id hide 
 And pray for the thunder and the rain 
 To quietly pass me by 
 Oh oh yeah 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine ooh yeah 
 Ooh sweet love of mine 
 Where do we go 
 Where do we go now 
 Mm where do we go Where do we go Where do we go 
 Where do we go now Where do we go 
 Where do we go Sweet child 
 Mm where do we go now 
 Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye Where do we go 
 Ooh where do we go now 
 Where do we go 
 Ahh where do we go now 
 Oh where do we go 
 Where do we go now 
 Now now now now now now now 
 Sweet child 
 Sweet child o mineImagine theres no heaven 
 Its easy if you try 
 No hell below us 
 Above us only sky 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living for today 
 Imagine theres no countries 
 It isnt hard to do 
 Nothing to kill or die for 
 And no religion too 
 Living life in peace 
 You may say Im a dreamer 
 But Im not the only one 
 I hope someday youll join us 
 And the world will be as one 
 Imagine no possessions 
 I wonder if you can 
 No need for greed or hunger 
 A brotherhood of man 
 Sharing all the world 
 And the world will live as oneBuddy youre a boy make a big noise

 I can see a love restrained 
 But darling when I hold you 
 Dont you know I feel the same yeah 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 And we both know hearts can change 
 And its hard to hold a candle 
 In the cold November rain 
 Weve been through this such a long long time 
 Just trying to kill the pain ooh yeah 
 But lovers always come and lovers always go 
 And no ones really sure whos letting go today walking away 
 If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
 I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine all mine 
 So if you want to love me 
 Then darling dont refrain 
 Or Ill just end up walking 
 Do you need some time on your own 
 Do you need some time all alone 
 Ooh everybody needs some time on their own 
 Ooh dont you know you need some time all alone 
 I know its hard to keep an open heart 
 When even friends seem out to harm you 
 But if you could heal a broken heart 
 Wouldnt time be out to charm you Oh 
 Sometimes I need some time on my own 
 Sometimes I need some time all alone 
 And when your fears subside 
 And shadows still remain ooh yeah 
 I know that you can love me 
 When theres no one left to blame 
 So nevermind the darkness 
 We still can find a way 
 Even cold November rain 
 Dont you think that you need somebody 
 Dont you think that you need someone 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 Youre not the only one 
 Everybody needs somebodyMy heart is full of love for you 
 I wanna get right next to you

 After she makes me buttfuck her 
 Cornshucker 
 Gonna stick my dick 
 Right up her ass 
 Gimme a dime 
 Gotta call my pimp 
 When I heard her ask 
 It made me go limp 
 Two weeks later 
 My sex life was drab 
 Instead of a wang 
 All I had was a scab 
 If youre sleazy 
 You better think Im first 
 Cause Ive got a dick like liverwurst 
 Gonna watch my dick 
 As I make her butt pucker 
 Hey hey hey hey hey 
 Through the ass

 Gonna wash my dick

 I like the way that KY greases your lipsWell when youre sitting there 
 In your silk upholstered chair 
 Talking to some rich folks that you know 
 Well I hope you wont see me 
 In my ragged company 
 You know I could never be alone 
 Take me down little Susie take me down 
 I know you think youre the Queen of the Underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I wont forget to put roses on your grave 
 Well when youre sitting back 
 In your rose pink Cadillac 
 Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day 
 Ill be in my basement room 
 With a needle and a spoon 
 And another girl to take my pain away 
 Say it with dead flowers at my wedding 
 No I wont forget to put roses on your graveChildhood living is easy to do 
 The things you wanted 
 I bought them for you graceless lady 
 You know who I am 
 You know I cant let you slide through my hand 
 Wild horses 
 Couldnt drag me away 
 Wild wild horses 
 I watched you suffer 
 A dull aching pain 
 Now youre decided 
 To show me the same 
 No sweeping exits 
 Or offstage lines 
 Could make me feel bitter 
 Or treat you unkind 
 I know Ive dreamed you 
 A sin n a lie 
 I have my freedom 
 But I dont have much time 
 Faith has been broken 
 Tears must be cried 
 Lets do some living 
 After we die 
 Couldnt drag me awayTook my chances carelessly 
 Choked on my own cigarette 
 You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby 
 But you aint seen the worst yet 
 Now Im reckless gonna have some fun 
 And the woman who is dead 
 Who was out alnight no Im not the only one 
 And I aint standing never standing 
 In the shadow of your love 
 Shadow of your love 
 Wrote my changes helplessly 
 Yeah but I got no regrets 
 Money it was on the table 
 So I booked with all the bets 
 Living like a lemon aint so hot 
 And you aint my idea 
 Of one highrollin shot 
 No I aint standing never standing 
 Big dark clouds hanging over your head 
 Hope youve heard baby all Ive said 
 Youve been told what Ive said 
 No use crying youre as good as dead 
 And the woman who is dead who is out all right 
 Now Im not the only one 
 And I aint standing never standingShe hit town like a rose in bloom 
 Smellin sweet said sweet perfume 
 The color faded and the petals died 
 Down in the city no one cried 
 In the streets the garbage lies 
 Protected by a million flies 
 The roaches so big 
 You know that they got bones 
 They moved in and made a tenement home 
 I said nice boys 
 Dont play rock and roll 
 Nice boys dont play rock and roll 
 Im not a nice boy 
 Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
 Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
 She met the man and she did the smack 
 Paid the price layin flat on her back 
 Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
 They ended up just being a toy 
 Played so hard burned her life away 
 Lies were told no promises made 
 You know nice boys 
 Im not a nice boy and I never was 
 Young and fresh when she hit town 
 Hot for kicks just to get around 
 But now she lays in a filthy room 
 She kills the pain with 
 A flick and a spoon 
 And in the streets the garbage lies 
 You know the roaches so big 
 Moved in and made a tenement home 
 No no no no no no no no baby 
 I bet you mama said 
 Nice boys dont play rock and roll 
 Nice boysYou like to hurt me you know that you do 
 You like to think in some way that its me and not you 
 you know it isnt true 
 You like to have me jump and be good but I dont want to do it 
 You dont know why I wont act the way you think I should 
 You thought theyd make me behave and submit 
 What were you thinking 
 Cause I dont forget 
 You dont know why I wont give in 
 To hell with the pressure Im not caving in 
 You know that I got under your skin 
 You sold your soul but I wont let you win 
 You talk too much you say I do 
 Difference is nobody cares about you 
 Youve got all the answers 
 You know everything 
 Why nobody asked you 
 Is a mystery to me 
 Im sorry for you 
 Not sorry for me 
 not sorry for me 
 You dont know who in the hell to or not to believe 
 or not to believe 
 Im sorry for you 
 You dont know who you can trust now or you should believe 
 You should believe 
 You close your eyes all well and good 
 Ill kicked your ass like I said that I would 
 You tell them stories theyd rather believe 
 Use and confuse them theyre numb and naive 
 Truth is the truth hurts Dont you agree 
 Its harder to live with the truth about you than to live with the lies about me 
 Nobody owes you 
 Not one god damn thing 
 You know where to put your 
 Just shut up and sing 
 You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free 
 Wont set them free 
 You know you 
 Anyone else should be sorry for you 
 Youve got no heart 
 You cant see all that youve done for me 
 I know the reasons you tear me apartI said baby you been lookin real good 
 You know that I remember when we met 
 Funny how I never felt so good 
 Its a feelin that I know 
 I know Ill never forget 
 Ooh it was the best time I can remember 
 Ooh and the love we shared 
 Is lovin thatll last forever 
 There wasnt much in this heart of mine 
 There was a little left and babe you found it

 And taste the flame 
 Back off back off bitch 
 Down in the gutter dyin in the ditch

 Face of an angel with the love of a witch 
 Makin love cheap heartbreaker 
 Broken backed nasty ballbreaker 
 Stay out of my bed outta my head 
 If its lovin you Im better off dead 
 Emotions ripped gone on a binge 
 Life lipped I said youre off the hinge 
 Tellin lies of such fame and glory

 Back off back off bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
 Hey whadya think hes tryin to say there anyway 
 I think its something each persons sposed to take in their own special way 
 Fucking bitchPlease allow me to introduce myself 
 Im a man of wealth and taste 
 Ive been around for a long long year 
 Stole many a mans soul and faith 
 And I was round when Jesus Christ 
 Had his moment of doubt and pain 
 Made damn sure that Pilate 
 Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guess my name 
 But whats puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game 
 I stuck around St Petersberg 
 When I saw it was a time for a change 
 Killed the Czar and his ministers 
 Anastasia screamed in vain 
 I rode a tank 
 Held a generals rank 
 When the Blitzkrieg raged 
 And the bodies stank 
 Hope you guess my name oh yeah 
 Whats puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game oh yeah 
 I watched with glee 
 While your kings and queens 
 Fought for ten decades 
 For the Gods they made 
 I shouted out 
 Who killed the Kennedys 
 When after all 
 It was you and me 
 Let me please introduce myself 
 And I laid traps for troubadors 
 Who could kill me in vain 
 Hope you guessed my name oh yeah 
 Is the nature of my game oh yeah get down baby 
 But whats confusing you 
 Is just the nature of my game 
 Just as every cop is a criminal 
 And all the sinners saints 
 As heads is tails 
 Just call me Lucifer 
 Cause Im in need of some restraint 
 So if you meet me 
 Have some courtesy 
 Have some sympathy and some taste 
 Use all your welllearned politesse 
 Or Ill lay your soul to waste um yeah 
 Hope you guessed my name um yeah 
 Is the nature of my game um baby get down 
 Woo who 
 Oh yeah get on down 
 Oh yeah 
 Tell me baby whats my name 
 Tell me honey baby guess my name 
 I tell you one time youre to blame 
 Ooh who

 Pulled my trigger now hes dead 
 Mama life had just begun 
 But now Ive gone and thrown it all away

 Too late my time has come 
 Sends shivers down my spine bodys aching all the time 
 Goodbye evrybody Ive got to go 
 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth 
 Mama ooh I dont want to die 
 I sometimes wish Id never been born at all 
 I see a little silhouetto of a man 
 Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango 
 Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightning me 
 Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo figaro 
 Magnifico Im just a poor boy and nobody loves me 
 Hes just a poor boy from a poor family 
 Spare him his life from this monstrosity 
 Easy come easy go will you let me go 
 Bismillah No we will not let you go 
 Let him go Bismillah We will not let you go 
 Let me go Will not let you go 
 Let me go Will not let you go Let me go Ah

 Oh mama mia mama mia Mama mia let me go 
 Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me 
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye 
 So you think you can love me and leave me to die 
 Oh baby cant do this to me baby 
 Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here 
 Nothing really matters Anyone can see 
 Nothing really matters 
 Nothing really matters to me 
 Any way the wind blowsAint it fun when youre always on the run 
 Aint it fun when your friends despise what you become 
 Aint it fun when you get so high 
 Well that you you just cant come 
 Aint it fun when you know that you going to die young 
 Its such fun 
 Good fun 
 Such fun 5x 
 Yeah fun 
 Such fun 
 Such 
 Aint it fun when you take good care of number one 
 Aint it fun when you feel like you just got to get a gun 
 Aint it fun when you just just just cant seem to find your tongue 
 Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung 
 Someone come up to me they spit right in my face 
 I didnt even feel it 
 It was such a disgrace 
 I punched my fist right through the glass 
 But it happened so fast 
 Such fun 11x 
 Fun 
 Aint it fun when you tell her shes just a cunt 
 Aint it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the bum 
 Well aint it fun when youve broken up every band that youve ever begun 
 Aint it fun when you know that youre going to die young 
 Such funIll take a nicotine caffeine sugar fix 
 Jesus dont ya git tired of turnin tricks 
 But when your innocence dies youll find the blues 
 Seems all our heroes were born to lose 
 Just walkin through time you believe this heat 
 Another empty house another dead end street 
 Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell 
 This side of heaven this close to Hell 
 Right next door to hell 
 Why dont you write a letter to me 
 I said Im right next door to hell 
 And so many eyes are on me 
 I got nowhere else to be 
 Feels like the walls are closing in on me 
 My mama never really said much to me 
 She was much too young and scared to be 
 Hell Freud might say thats what I need 
 But all I really ever get is greed 
 And most my friends they feel the same 
 Hell we dont even have ourselves to blame 
 But times are hard and thrills are cheaper 
 As your arms get shorter your pockets get deeper 
 I never thought this is where Id be 
 But Im right next door to hell 
 Thinkin timell stand still for me 
 Fuck you 
 Bitch 
 Not bad kids just stupid ones 
 Yeah we thought wed own the world 
 And gettin used was havin fun 
 I said were not sad kids just lucid ones yeah 
 Flowin through life not collectin anyone 
 So much out there still so much to see 
 Times too much to handle times too much for me 
 It drives me up the walls 
 It drives me out of my mind 
 Can you tell me what this meanshuhIf we could see tomorrow 
 What of your plans 
 No one can live in sorrow 
 Ask all your friends 
 Times that you took in stride 
 Theyre back in demand 
 I was the one whos washing 
 Blood off your hands 
 Dont you cry tonight 
 I still love you baby 
 Theres a heaven above you baby 
 And dont you cry tonight 
 I know the things you wanted 
 Theyre not what you have 
 With all the people talkin 
 Its drivin you mad 
 If I was standin by you 
 How would you feel 
 Knowing your loves decided 
 And all love is real 
 An dont you cry tonight 
 I thought I could live in your world 
 As years all went by 
 With all the voices Ive heard 
 Something has died 
 And when youre in need of someone 
 My heart wont deny you 
 So many seem so lonely 
 With no one left to cry to baby 
 And dont you cry 
 Dont you ever cry 
 Baby maybe someday 
 Dont you cry 
 TonightLove oh ohh 
 Is it true 
 What they say of you 
 Gonna call the President 
 Gonna call a Private I 
 Gonna get the IRS 
 Gonna need the FBI 
 Theres not anymore that I can do 
 All the reasons that you gave Id follow you 
 To when you plead the fifth 
 Thatd be the end of time its true 
 Wouldnt be the first time Ive been wrong 
 Wouldnt be the last I should have known 
 Through all the rumors I can tell 
 Some things didnt work so well 
 Well anyway it feels the same 
 As when you first told me you were gone 
 So long ago but Ive still held on 
 Through all the emotions the love and the sex 
 Thats the truth and heres the worst yet 
 Wouldnt even matter the things that Id say 
 You made your mind up and gone anyway 
 Theres no use now in dragging it on 
 Couldve seen it coming all along 
 Well its true oh 
 I had my doubts with you 
 Gonna call myself a private I 
 Gonna need the IRS 
 Gonna get the FBI 
 Gonna make this a federal case 
 Gonna wave it right down in your face 
 Read it daily with your morning news 
 With a sweet hangover and the headlines too now 
 I bet youre thinking Im doing this all for my health 
 I shouldve looked again then at somebody else 
 Feelin like Ive done way more than wrong 
 Feelin like Im living inside of this song 
 Feelin like Im just too tired to care 
 Feelin like I done more than my share 
 Could it be the way that Ive carried on 
 Like a broken record for so long 
 What can I do 
 Ooh oh 
 Im gonna call the President 
 Im gonna call a private I 
 Gonna need myself the FBI 
 Ooh what shall I do 
 I gave my heart to you oh 
 Its such a crime you know its true 
 Gonna call the president 
 Gonna need myself a private I 
 Ooh gonna need the IRS 
 Gonna make it a federal case

 You pack your bags 
 And you move to the city 
 Theres somethin missin here at home 
 You fix your hair 
 And youre lookin real pretty 
 Its time to get it out on your own 
 Youre always fightin 
 With your mama and you papa 
 Your family life is one big pain 
 When you you gonna move to the city 
 Into the city where it all began 
 You gotta move You gotta move 
 Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma 
 Time you gotta move 
 You stole your mamas car 
 And your daddys plastic credit card 
 Youre sixteen and you cant get a job 
 Youre not goin very far 
 Youre always ridin 
 With the teachers and the police 
 This life is much too insane 
 Right to the city 
 Where the real men get it 
 Aw child aint it a pity 
 Sometimes it gets too shitty 
 Come on and hit me 
 Youre on the streets 
 And it aint so pretty 
 You need to get a new what you please 
 You do what you gotta do for the money 
 At times you end up on your knees 
 Im always buyin 
 With the local and the junkies 
 This city life is one big pain 
 But you you had to move to the city 
 Oh right to the city 
 With the real nitty gritty 
 Come on and hit meAnd now I dont know why 
 She wouldnt say goodbye 
 But then it seems that I 
 Had seen it in her eyes 
 Though it might not be wise 
 I still have to try 
 With all the love I have inside 
 I cant deny 
 I just cant let it die 
 Cause her hearts just like mine 
 And she holds her pain inside 
 So if you ask me why 
 I know somewhere inside 
 There is a special light 
 Still shining bright 
 And even on the darkest night 
 She cant deny 
 So if shes somewhere near me 
 I hope to God she hears me 
 Theres no one else could ever make me feel Im so alive 
 I hoped shed never leave me 
 Please God you must believe me 
 Ive searched the universe and found myself within her eyes 
 No matter how I try 
 They say its all a lie 
 So whats the use of my 
 Confessions to a crime 
 Of passions that wont die 
 In my heart 
 So now I dont know why 
 It just might be that I 
 And now it seems that I 
 Gave up my ghost of pride 
 Ill never say goodbyeI used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her Mm yeah 
 I had to put her six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complain 
 I used to love her Ooh yeah 
 I knew Id miss her 
 So I had to keep her 
 Shes buried right in my backyard 
 Oh yeah Ooh yeah whoa oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 She bitched so much She drove me nuts 
 And now Im happier this way yeah 
 Whoa oh yeah 
 I had to put her Ooh six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complainIf I say I dont need anyone 
 I can say these things to you 
 Cause I can turn on anyone 
 Just like I turned on you 
 Ive got a tongue like a razor 
 A sweet switchblade knife 
 And I can do you favors 
 But then youll do whatever I like 
 Here I am 
 And youre a Rocket Queen 
 I might be a little young 
 But honey I aint naive 
 And youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah 
 I might be too much 
 But honey youre a bit obscene 
 Ive seen everything imaginable 
 Pass before these eyes 
 Ive had everything thats tangible 
 Honey youd be surprised 
 Im a sexual innuendo 
 In this burned out paradise 
 If you turn me on to anything 
 You better turn me on tonight 
 I see you standing standing on your own 
 Its such a lonely place for you for you to be 
 If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend 
 Ill be here standing until the bitter end 
 No one needs the sorrow 
 No one needs the pain 
 I hate to see you 
 Walking out there out in the rain 
 So dont chastise me 
 Or think I I mean you harm 
 Of those that take you 
 Leave you strung out much too far baby yeah 
 Woah no woah woah baby yeah 
 Dont ever leave me 
 Say youll always be there 
 All I ever wanted 
 Was for you to know that I careGonna find a way to cure this loneliness 
 Yeah Ill find a way to cure the pain 
 If I said that youre my friend 
 And our love would never end 
 How long before I had your trust again 
 I opened up the doors when it was cold outside 
 Hoping that youd find your own way in 
 But how can I protect you 
 Or try not to neglect you 
 When you wont take the love I have to give 
 I bought me an illusion 
 And I put it on the wall 
 I let it fill my head with dreams 
 And I had to have them all 
 But oh the taste is never so sweet 
 As what youd believe it is 
 Well I guess it never is 
 Its these prejudiced illusions 
 That pumps the blood to the heart of the biz 
 You know I never thought that it could take so long 
 You know I never knew how to be strong 
 Yeah I let you shape me 
 But I feel as though you raped me 
 Cause you climbed inside my world and in my songs 
 Now Ive closed the door to keep the cold outside 
 Seems somehow Ive found the will to live 
 But how can I forget you 
 Or try not to reject you 
 When we both know it takes time to forgive yeah 
 Sweetness is a virtue 
 And you lost your virtue long ago 
 You know Id like to hurt you 
 But my conscience always tells me no 
 You could sell your body on the street 
 To anyone whom you might meet 
 Whod love to try and get inside 
 And bust your innocence open wide 
 Cause my babys got a locomotive 
 My babys gone off the track 
 My babys got a locomotive 
 Gotta peel the bitch off my back 
 I know it looks like Im insane 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame no 
 Gonna have some fun with my frustration 
 Gonna watch the big screen in my head 
 Id rather take a detour 
 Cause this road aint getting clearer 
 Your train of thought has cut me off again 
 Better tame that boy cause hes a wild one 
 Better tame that boy fore hes a man 
 Sweetheart dont make me laugh 
 Yous getting too big for your pants 
 And Is think maybe you should cut out while you can 
 You can use you illusion 
 Let it take you where it may 
 We live and learn 
 And then sometimes its best to walk away 
 Me Im just here hanging out in my only place to stay 
 At least for now anyway 
 Ive worked too hard for my illusions 
 Just to throw them all away 
 Im taking time for quiet consolation 
 In passing by this love thats passed away 
 I know its never easy 
 So why should you believe me 
 When Ive always got so many things to say 
 Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made 
 Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged 
 You know I tried to wake you 
 I mean how long could it take you 
 To open up your eyes and turn the page hey 
 Kindness is a treasure 
 And its one towards me youve seldom shown 
 So Ill say it for good measure 
 To all the ones like you Ive known 
 You know Id like to shave your head 
 And all my friends could paint it red 
 Cause love to mes a two way street 
 And all I really want is peace 
 But my babys got a locomotive 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame no 
 Affection is a blessing 
 Can you find it in your sordid heart 
 I tried to keep this thing together 
 But the tremor tore my pad apart 
 Yeah I know its hard to face 
 When all weve worked fors gone to waste 
 But youre such a stupid woman 
 And Im such a stupid man 
 But love like times got its own plans 
 Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame 
 Yeah 
 If love is blind I guess Ill buy myself a cane 
 Loves so strange 
 Loves so strangeMans got his woman to take his seed 
 Hes got the power  oh 
 Shes got the need 
 She spends her life through pleasing up her man 
 She feeds him dinner or anything she can 
 She cries alone at night too often 
 He smokes and drinks and dont come home at all 
 Only women bleed 
 Man makes your hair gray 
 Hes your lifes mistake 
 All youre really lookin for is an even break 
 He lies right at you 
 You know you hate this game 
 He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain 
 Black eyes all of the time 
 Dont spend a dime 
 Clean up this grime 
 And you there down on your knees begging me please come 
 Watch me bleed 
 Only women bleedKickin back in the shadows 
 Got no need for the light 
 Whos sorry now old timer 
 Look at how youve spent your life 
 Scroungin for change 
 To put some money in your pocket 
 My how scratch does burn 
 Laughin at the suckers as you pissed it away 
 But I got the time and I got the muscle 
 I got the need to lay it all on the line 
 I aint afraid of your smoke screen hustle 
 Its a perfect crime 
 Goddamn it its a perfect crime 
 Motherfucker its a perfect crime 
 I said its perfect 
 Keep the demons down and drag the skeletons out 
 I got a blind man followin me in chains 
 I said hes fun to watch when the world has stopped 
 And I think hes got somethin to say 
 You wanna fuck with me 
 Dont fuck with me 
 Cause Im what youll be 
 So dont fuck with me 
 If you had better sense 
 Youd step aside from the bad side of me 
 Dont fuck with the bad side of me 
 Stay away from the bad side of me 
 Dont fuck with the bad side

 Ostracized but thats all right

 And when you stare dont you think I feel it 
 But Im gonna deal it back to you in spades

 And when youre talkin about a vasectomy yeah

 To be in loveNo I wont 
 You know youre all alone 
 Your friends they arent at home 
 Everybodys gone to the garden 
 As you look into the trees 
 You can look but you dont see 
 Flowers seem to tease you at the garden 
 Everybodys there 
 But you dont seem to care 
 Whats it with you man and this garden yeah 
 Turned into my worst phobia 
 A crazy mans utopia 
 If youre lost no one can show ya 
 But it sure was glad to know ya 
 Only poor boys take a chance 
 On the gardens song and dance 
 Feel her flowers as they wrap around 
 But only smart boys do without 
 You can find it all inside 
 No need to wrestle with your pride 
 No you aint losin your mind 
 Youre just in the garden 
 They can lead you to yourself 
 Or you can throw it on the shelf 
 But you know you can look inside 
 For the garden 
 I wasnt really scared 
 Lost my virginity there 
 To a gypsy with blonde hair 
 But now no one seems to care 
 Like a mouse inside a maze 
 Wandering round for days 
 With a smile upon my face 
 I never wanna leave this place 
 On this gardens song and dance 
 Its a crazy mans utopia 
 If youre lost no one can show ya 
 Bye bye 
 So long bye bye 
 Its glad to know ya 
 Aw so longTalk to me softly 
 There is something in your eyes 
 Dont hang your head in sorrow 
 And please dont cry 
 I know how you feel inside Ive 
 Ive been there before 
 Somethin is changin inside you 
 And dont you know 
 Give me a whisper 
 And give me a sign 
 Give me a kiss before you 
 Tell me goodbye 
 Dont you take it so hard now 
 And please dont take it so bad 
 Ill still be thinkin of you 
 And the times we had baby 
 And please remember that I never lied 
 And please remember 
 How I felt inside now honey 
 You gotta make it your own way 
 But youll be all right now sugar 
 Youll feel better tomorrow 
 Come the morning light now baby

 Time went by and it became a joke 
 We just needed more and more fulfilling uhhuh 
 Time went by and it all went up in smoke 
 But check it out

 It might cost a lot more than youd think

 Bring it down 
 Youre fuckin crazyAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 All the innocence inside 
 You know I tried so hard to make you 
 To make you change your mind 
 And it hurts too much to see you 
 And how you left yourself behind 
 You know I didnt want to meet you 
 Now theres a hell I cant describe 
 So now I wander through my day 
 Trying to find my way 
 Still these feelings that I felt 
 I said to you and no one else 
 And no its not going to change 
 I know its gone still Im used 
 And thats nice to hang on someone 
 A change thats bittersweet 
 Thats called the blues 
 Dont know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 You know its what you planned this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore 
 I dont know just what I should do 
 You know its what we planned this much is true 
 What this means to me 
 The more I know you believe 
 What I thought was you now 
 Has got more that it changed on you 
 What I thought was true 
 The more that I might know is you 
 What I thought was you 
 Is only memories distantDiamonds and fast cars 
 Money to burn 
 I got my head in the clouds 
 I got these thoughts to churn 
 Got my feet in the sand 
 I got a house on the hill 
 I got a headache like a mother 
 Twice the price of my thrills 
 And its a cold day 
 Its a continental drift 
 I said this traffic is hell 
 Can you give me a lift 
 And Ill try to paint a story 
 Got your pictures to tell 
 Yeah you got to make a living 
 With what you bring yourself to sell 
 I got some genuine 
 Imitation bad apples 
 Free sample for your peace of mind 
 Only 995 
 I got my camera back from customs 
 Got my law fees up to date 
 Hell they musta seen me comin 
 Aint this life so fuckin great 
 When the shit hit the fan 
 It was all I could stand yeah 
 Well Im a frequent flyer 
 My bodys breathing while it can 
 But what I dont understand is that 
 My world aint gettin no brighter 
 If I could touch the sky 
 Well I would float on by 
 While everybodys talkin hell Im just another guy 
 If it were up to me 
 Id say just leave me be 
 Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch 
 Gold and caviar 
 Now why dont you pour my apathy 
 And Id have all my bases covered 
 If I could teach my hands to see 
 But now were down in the deep end 
 Where theyd love to watch you drown 
 I said your laundry could use washing 
 Well hang it up all over town 
 I said Hollywoods like a dryer 
 And were down on Sunset Strip 
 And youll be suckin down the Clorox 
 Till your lifes all nice and crisp 
 BoyI get up around seven 
 Get outta bed around nine 
 And I dont worry about nothin no 
 Cause worryins a waste of my time 
 The show usually starts around seven 
 We go on stage around nine 
 Get on the bus about eleven 
 Sippin a drink and feelin fine 
 We been dancin with Mr Brownstone 
 Hes been knockin 
 He wont leave me alone 
 No no no he wont leave me alone 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 Now I get up around whenever 
 I used to get up on time 
 But that old man hes a real motherfucker 
 Gonna kick him on down the line 
 No no no he wont leave me alone never 
 Oh leave me alone 
 Stuck it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle 
 And it it drove me outta my mind 
 I shouldve known better said I wish I never met her 
 Said I I leave it all behind 
 YowsaWe both lie silently still 
 In the dead of the night 
 Although we both lie close together 
 We feel miles apart inside 
 Was it something I said or something I did 
 Did my words not come out right 
 Though I tried not to hurt you 
 Though I tried 
 But I guess thats why they say 
 Every rose has its thorn 
 Just like every night has its dawn 
 Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song 
 Yeah it does 
 I listen to our favorite song 
 Playing on the radio 
 Hear the DJ say loves a game 
 Of easy come and easy go 
 But I wonder does he know 
 Has he ever felt like this 
 And I know youd be here right now 
 If I could have let you know somehow 
 I guess 
 Though its been a while now 
 I can still feel so much pain 
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals 
 But the scar that scar remains 
 I know I could have saved our love that night 
 If Id known what to say 
 Instead of makin love 
 We both made our separate ways 
 But now I hear you found somebody new 
 And that I never meant that much to you 
 To hear that tears me up inside 
 And to see you cuts me like a knife 
 I guessNow if you know anything about us we write most of our sond with based off an eliment of truth but this song is kinda like a fantasy and a joke cause its kind of a sick subject but you know sometimes when your boyfriend or your girlfriend is just a pain in a fuckin ass and you wish you could chop there fuckin head off and stick it in a bag and put it in the back yardThis is called I Used To Love Her But I had To Kill Her 
 And I can still hear her complainWhen youre talkin to yourself 
 And nobodys home 
 You can fool yourself 
 You came in this world alone 
 Alone 
 So nobody ever told you baby 
 How it was gonna be 
 So whatll happen to you baby 
 Guess well have to wait and see 
 One two 
 Old at heart but Im only 28 
 And Im much too young to let love break my heart 
 Young at heart but its getting much too late 
 To find ourselves so far apart 
 I dont know how youre supposed to find me lately 
 And what more could you ask from me 
 How could you say that I never needed you 
 When you took everything 
 Said you took everything from me 
 Young at heart and it gets so hard to wait 
 When no one I know can seem to help me now 
 Old at heart but I mustnt hesitate 
 If Im to find my own way out 
 Still talkin to myself 
 So nobody ever told us baby 
 So whatll happen to us baby 
 When I find out all the reasons 
 Maybe Ill find another way 
 Find another day 
 With all the changing seasons of my life 
 Maybe Ill get it right next time 
 And now that youve been broken down 
 Got your head out of the clouds 
 Youre back down on the ground 
 And you dont talk so loud 
 And you dont walk so proud 
 Anymore and what for 
 Well I jumped into the river 
 Too many times to make it home 
 Im out here on my own 
 And drifting all alone 
 If it doesnt show give it time 
 To read between the lines 
 Cause I see the storm is getting closer 
 And the waves they get so high 
 Seems everything weve ever knowns here 
 Why must it drift away and die 
 Ill never find any light to replace you 
 Guess Ill have to make it through this time 
 Oh this time 
 Without you 
 I knew the storm was getting closer 
 And all my friends said I was high 
 But everything weve ever knowns here 
 I never wanted it to dieIm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth

 If my intentions 
 Are misunderstood 
 Please be kind

 All I should 
 I wont ask 
 Of you 
 What I would 
 Not do 
 Oh I saw the damage in you 
 My fortune had won the ending you 
 Why would they tell me to please dont just laugh in my face 
 When all of the reasons they taugh us fall over themselves 
 To give way 
 Ah yeah 
 Its not a question whether my heart is true 
 Streamed line 
 I had to pull through 
 Look for a new beginning 
 On you 
 Whoa I got a message for you 
 Open a way its what Ive got to do 
 Give what you have for what you might lose 
 What would you say if I told you that Im to blame 
 And what would you do if I had to deny your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away 
 Ooh yeah 
 Who should I tell if not for the ones 
 That you could not save 
 Ooh now 
 I told you when I found you 
 If there was doubts you 
 Should be careful and unafraid 
 Now they surround you 
 All that amounts to 
 Is love that youve crippled for fortune and fame 
 If my affections 
 Are misunderstood 
 And you decide 
 Im up to no good 
 Dont ask me to 
 Enjoy them just for you 
 Ask yourself 
 What I would do 
 To prostitute myself 
 To live with fortune and shame 
 When you should have turned to the hearts of the ones 
 That you would not save 
 I told you 
 When I found you 
 Is love that youve crippled for fortune and fameIm reckless and feelin no pain 
 You know Ive got no need to control 
 Livin with the danger 
 Im always on the edge now 
 With million dollar visions that I hold 
 Livin like this never ever 
 Tore my life apart 
 I know how to maintain 
 And you know I know my part 
 On a holiday a permanent vacation 
 Im living on a cigarette with wine 
 Im never alone cause Ive got myself 
 Yes I imitate myself all of the time 
 Cause its comin from my heart 
 I lead a reckless life 
 And I dont need your advice 
 And you know its my only vice 
 Reckless life 
 And you know its my only 
 Hey hey  yeahI never meant to cause you any sorrow 
 I never meant to cause you any pain 
 I only wanted to one time see you laughing 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain 
 Purple rain Purple rain 
 I never wanted to be your weekend lover 
 I only wanted to be some kind of friend 
 I could never steal you from another 
 Its such a shame our friendship had to end 
 I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain 
 Honey I know I know times are changing 
 Its time we all reach out for something new 
 That means you too 
 You say you want a leader 
 But you cant seem to make up your mind 
 I think you better close it 
 And let me guide you to the purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rainNo one ever told me when I was alone 
 They just thought Id know better better 
 No one ever told me when I was alone 
 The hardest part this troubled heart 
 Has never yet been through now 
 Was heal the scars that got their start 
 Inside someone like you now 
 For had I known or Id been shown 
 Back when how long itd take me 
 To break the charms that brought me harm 
 And all but would erase me 
 I never would or thought I could 
 No matter what youd pay me 
 Replay the part you stole my heart 
 I should have known youre crazy 
 If all I knew was that with you 
 Id want someone to save me 
 Itd be enough but just my luck 
 I fell in love and maybe 
 All that I wanted was 
 Now I know you better 
 You know I know better 
 So bittersweet this tragedy 
 Wont ask for absolution 
 This melody inside of me 
 Still searches for solution 
 A twist of fate a change of heart 
 Cures my infatuation 
 Of a broken heart provides the spark 
 For my determination 
 I never wanted you to be so full of anger 
 I never wanted you to be somebody else 
 I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves 
 I only wanted you to see things for yourself 
 Now we all know better 
 All that I wanted was 
 No no no no 
 No no no no 
 If I were you Id manage to 
 Avoid the invitation 
 Of promised love that cant keep up 
 With your adoration 
 Just use your head and in the end 
 Youll find your inspiration 
 To choose your steps and wont regret 
 This kind of aggravation 
 They just thought Id know better betterSweet little lady dont you get crazy

 Ya like to dance ya like to sing

 Ya wanna danceWe all come in from the cold 
 We come down from the wire 
 And everybody warms themselves 
 To a different fire 
 When sometimes we get burned 
 Youd think sometime wed learn 
 The one you love is the one 
 That should take you higher 
 You aint got no one 
 You better go back out and find her 
 Just like children hidin in a closet 
 Cant tell whats goin on outside 
 Sometimes were so far off the beaten path 
 We get taken for a ride 
 By a parlor trick or some words of wit 
 A hidden hand up a sleeve 
 To think that thee one you love could hurt you now 
 Is a little hard to believe 
 But everybody darlin 
 Sometimes bites the hand that feeds 
 When I look around 
 Everybody always brings me down 
 Well is it them or me 
 Well I just cant see 
 But there aint no peace to found 
 But if someone really cared 
 Well theyd take the time to spare 
 A moment to try and understand 
 Another ones despair 
 Remember in this game we call life 
 That no one said its fair 
 Ooh yeah 
 Breakdown 
 let me hear it now 
 let me hear it now yeah 
 Get down with yo bad self alright 
 Ive come to know the cold 
 I think of it as home 
 When there aint enough of me to go around 
 Id rather be left alone 
 But if I call you out of habit 
 Im out of love and I gotta have it 
 Would you give it to me if I fit you needs 
 Like when we both knew we had it 
 But now the damages done 
 And were back out on the run 
 Funny how everything was roses 
 When we held on to the guns 
 Just because youre winnin 
 Dont mean youre the lucky ones 
 yeah 
 Hay yay 
 There goes the challenger 
 Being chased by the blue blue meanies on wheels 
 The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver 
 The last American hero 
 Thethe electric sintar 
 The demigod 
 The super driver of the golden west 
 Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver 
 The police numbers are getting closercloser 
 Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby 
 They about to strike they gonna get him SMASH  RAPE  
 The last beautiful free soul on this planet 
 But it is written 
 If the Evil Spirit arms the Tiger with claws 
 Brahman provided wings for the Dove 
 Thus spake the Super Guru

 And what you need is a plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint 
 Whos going to sit through all the madness always act so quaint 
 I said  a oh yeah well  a 
 Its your new friend youre really 
 Making a scene and Ive seen you 
 Bouncing around from machine to machine 
 But you know that 
 Theyre never really 
 Never really what they seem and you can count on 
 Generate some warmth then youll 
 See just what I mean oh baby baby baby yeah 
 Then if Im acting like a king dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being and if I 
 Want too many things dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being 
 And if Ive got to dream dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being and well if 
 Its a bit obscene dont you know its cause 
 I dont gotta walk around with my head on down 
 Just like a human oh no a human being

 Wont you give me a little sip why wont you give me a 
 Drag of that cigarette why dont you

 Youre trying to cover up a big disgrace 
 Baby yeah yeah yeah 
 Come on come on come on 
 Well I may think that this whole scene is just a 
 Too appalling for me 
 Well I may be the type whos just mad about 
 Every little thing that I see but I can 
 Colour that with history and make it 
 Just what I want it to be well Im 
 Blowing my change on the fan magazines with all the 
 Hollywood refugees oh baby baby oh yeah 
 Im a human beingTake me down to the paradise city 
 Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty 
 Take me home Oh wont you please take me home 
 Take me down to the paradise city 
 Just an urchin livin under the street 
 Im a hard case thats tough to beat 
 Im your charity case so buy me somethin to eat 
 Ill pay you at another time 
 Take it to the end of the line 
 Rags to riches or so they say 
 You gotta keep pushin for the fortune and fame 
 You know its its all a gamble when its just a game 
 You treat it like a capital crime 
 Everybodys doin their time 
 Oh wont you please take me home yeah yeah 
 Take me home 
 Strapped in the chair of the citys gas chamber 
 Why Im here I cant quite remember 
 The surgeon general says its hazardous to breathe 
 Id have another cigarette but I cant see 
 Tell me who ya gonna believe 
 Take me home yeah yeah 
 Oh wont you please take me home yeah 
 So far away 
 Captain Americas been torn apart 
 Now hes a court jester with a broken heart 
 He said Turn me around and take me back to the start 
 I must be losin my mind are you blind 
 Ive seen it all a million times 
 Oh wont you please take me home 
 Oh wont you please take me home home 
 Oh I want to go I want to know 
 I want to see how good it can be 
 Take me down take me down 
 Oh oh take me home 
 I want to know I want to know 
 Yeah babyWhat weve got here is failure to communicate 
 Some men you just cant reach 
 So you get what we had here last week 
 which is the way he wants it 
 Well he gets it  I dont like it 
 any more than you men 
 Look at your young men fighting 
 Look at your women crying 
 Look at your young men dying 
 The way theyve always done before 
 Look at the hate were breeding 
 Look at the fear were feeding 
 Look at the lives were leading 
 The way weve always done before 
 My hands are tied 
 The billions shift from side to side 
 And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
 For the love of God and our human rights 
 And all these things are swept aside 
 By bloody hands time cant deny 
 And are washed away by your genocide 
 And history hides the lies of our civil war 
 Did you wear a black armband 
 When they shot the man 
 Who said 
 Peace could last forever 
 And in my first memories 
 They shot Kennedy 
 I went numb when I learned to see 
 So I never fell for Vietnam 
 We got the wall of DC to remind us all 
 That you cant trust freedom 
 When its not in your hands 
 When everybodys fightin 
 For their promised land and 
 I dont need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Aint that fresh 
 No no no no no 
 Look at the shoes youre filling 
 Look at the blood were spilling 
 Look at the world were killing 
 Look in the doubt weve wallowed 
 Look at the leaders weve followed 
 Look at the lies weve swallowed 
 And I dont want to hear no more 
 For all Ive seen has changed my mind 
 But still the wars go on as the years go by 
 With no love of God or human rights 
 Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
 By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
 Who carry the cross of homicide 
 And history bears the scars of our civil war 
 We practice selective annihilation 
 Of mayors and government officials 
 for example to create a vacuum 
 Then we fill that vacuum 
 As popular war advances 
 Peace is closer 
 And I dont need your civil war 
 I dont need one more war 
 No no no 
 Whats so civil bout war anywayAll I need is some inspiration 
 But boredom eats me like cancer 
 Drinking lemonade shandy 
 Aint nobody here to do me harm 
 I cant fall in love with a wheatfield 
 Well everything smells like horse shit 
 Baaaaa 
 Hold stillYou better change your attitude 
 Cause you know you want it to 
 You bring me all your pride 
 But I know you hold it too 
 I can feed your bounty yeah 
 If you feed my head as well 
 And I wont give you empty promises yeah 
 When the quarters in the wishing well 
 But this aint no sentimental movie 
 Where dreams collect like dust 
 You talk to me with innocence in your eyes 
 So now who can you trust 
 You think you look so cool 
 Yes you do 
 You take me for your fool yeah 
 Itching for your of the hug 
 Baby I want a new start but dont you be true yeah 
 I can see through your door 
 You put my head into these walls 
 You take my heart to the dockside yeah 
 You put me in the car 
 And take me for another ride 
 Trust 
 Put a path on to your veins 
 And antique and old whores our new pain yeah 
 The tears you cried 
 All the tears you cried tonight 
 You put me down 
 But you cant get out of sight 
 And this aint no sentimental movie 
 You push it on 
 You grab it on 
 But I dont see the TV 
 This aint no sentimental movie 
 Yeah see the screen 
 Youre startin to scream 
 Abusin confusin 
 Your programs over 
 Yeah you look so cool 
 Dont take me for another one of your scenes 
 YeaSeems like forever and a day 
 If my intentions are misunderstood 
 Please be kind Ive done all I should 
 I wont ask of you what I would not do 
 Oh I saw the damage in you 
 My fortunate one 
 The envy of youth 
 Why would they tell me to please those 
 That laugh in my face 
 When all of the reasons theyve taught us 
 Fall over themselves to give way 
 Its not a question whether my heart is true 
 Streamlined I had to pull through 
 Look for a new beginning on you 
 Oh I got a message for you 
 Up and away 
 Its what I gotta do 
 Forgive what you have 
 For what you might lose 
 And what would you do if I had to deny your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you 
 And then walked away 
 N who would I turn to if not for the ones 
 You could not say 
 If there were doubts you 
 And all that amounts to 
 Is love that you fed by 
 Perversion and pain 
 So if my affections are misunderstood 
 And you decide Im up to no good 
 Dont ask me to enjoy them just for you 
 Ask yourself 
 Why I would choose 
 To prostitute myself 
 To live with fortune and shame oh yeah 
 That you could not save 
 Perversion and painIve been lookin for a trace 
 Lookin for a lover in a world 
 Thats much too dark 
 Ooh yeah 
 Youve got to find yourself 
 Another piece of the action yeah 
 Ive been lookin everywhere 
 Ive been lookin for you 
 Ive got your satisfaction 
 Another piece of the action 
 Cause your crazy 
 Crazy 
 Youre fuckin crazy 
 Oh my 
 Oh child 
 I said youre crazy 
 Say boy where ya coming from 
 Whered you get that point of view 
 Said I knew someone like you and they said 
 Yeah 
 Youve gotta find yourself 
 Cause youre crazy 
 Ooh youre crazy 
 Ooh yeah youre crazy 
 Youre fuckin crazyIt was long ago 
 Seems like a dream 
 The day I sucked the air 
 From a bottle of whipped cream 
 And I got real high 
 And things got real slow 
 And I started talking like this 
 Whats going on 
 I dont know 
 And then I sold my car 
 For a Greatful Dead ticket 
 My dad yelled at me 
 And he grounded me 
 And he said I was a dick 
 It was the worst day of my life 
 And Ill never forget 
 But the very next day 
 I was doing bong hits 
 In the back of my friends chevy 
 So dont tell me 
 Were winning the war on drugs 
 Cause drugs are like a big ol can of raid 
 And youre all little bugs 
 And dont tell me 
 To not get high 
 Cause Im as low as I can get 
 Without kissing your ass 
 And blowing you at the same time 
 Man dont tell me about love and peace 
 When one of the Joneses have a handgun 
 Pointed at me 
 Dont tell me to just say no 
 Im an addict I say dont let me go 
 Whatever happened to sex drugs n rock n roll 
 Now we just have AIDS crack and techno 
 So they busted me 
 So I say fuck them up 
 For selling dope 
 And I went to jail 
 And I wasnt forgiven 
 Like that little fucker who shot the pope 
 And he said I had the right to remain silent 
 And they couldnt explain 
 But I didnt resist 
 And I was invited 
 Cause all I ever wanted was the right to remain 
 And they questioned me 
 Yeah they asked me why 
 And I said fuck off 
 I dont think I should be shot 
 For selling pot 
 Its just my little way of saying high 
 Now my records all fucked up 
 Now two times a week 
 They make me piss in a cup 
 Well what I want to do 
 Is piss down their throats 
 Okay heres the sensitive part 
 They told me 
 That times have changed 
 Cause our parents had 
 Hendrix Janice and Jim 
 But what about 
 River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain 
 And they told me 
 To praise the lord 
 But Ive been waiting for so long 
 For him to call me back 
 I think Im gonna go pray 
 At Betty Ford 
 That life was fair 
 I cant smoke a plant that was made by God 
 But I can kill my wife if Im a football player

 I got a brand new rose in townI was born in a crossfire hurricane 
 And I howled at my ma in the driving rain 
 But its all right now in fact its a gas 
 But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash 
 Its a Gas Gas Gas 
 I was raised by a toothless bearded hag 
 I was schooled with a strap right across my back 
 But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash 
 I was drowned I was washed up and left for dead 
 I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled 
 I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 I was crowned with a spike right through my head 
 Jumping Jack Flash its a gas 
 Jumping Jack FlashIt dont really matter 
 You will find out for yourself 
 No it dont really matter 
 Youre gonna leave this thing to somebody else 
 If they where missionaires 
 Real time visionaires 
 Sitting in a Chinese stew 
 To view my disinfatuation 
 I know that Im a classic case 
 Watch my disenchanted face 
 Blame it on the Falun Gong 
 Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on 
 Cause it would take a lot more hate than you 
 To stop the fascination 
 Bigger than an iron fist 
 Our baby got to rule the nation 
 But all I got is precious time 
 It dont really matter 
 Youre gonna find out for yourself 
 So you can hear now from 
 Somebody else 
 Cause it would take a lot more time than you 
 Ive got more masturbation 
 Even with your iron fist 
 More than you got to rule the nation 
 What I got is precious time 
 Gonna keep it to myself 
 No it dont really matter 
 So you can hear it now from 
 You think you got it all locked up inside 
 And if you beat them all up theyll die 
 Been like a walk in the park for myself 
 And now youre keepin your own kind in hell 
 And if your Great Wall rocks blame yourself 
 While they all reach out for your help 
 And Im outta timeRollin 
 1 2 3 1 2 3 
 I tried so hard just to get through to you 
 But your heads so far from the realness of truth 
 Was it just a come on in the dark 
 Wasnt meant to last long 
 I think youve worn your welcome honey 
 Ill just see you along 
 As I sing you this song 
 Time can pass slowly things always change 
 You days been numbered and Ive read your last page 
 You was just a temporary lover honey 
 You aint the first 
 Lots of others came before you woman

 Said you been the worst 
 So goodbye to you girl 
 So long farewell 
 I cant hear you cryin 
 Your jivins been hell 
 So look for me walkin 
 Down your street at night 
 Ill be in with another 
 Deep down inside 
 To the bar That was a takeI try and feel the sunshine 
 You bring the rain 
 You try and hold me down 
 With your complaints 
 You cry and moan and complain 
 You whine an tear 
 Up to my neck in sorrow 
 The touch you bring 
 You just dont step inside to 
 To 14 years 
 So hard to keep my own head 
 Thats what I say and you know 
 Ive been the beggar 
 Ive played the thief 
 I was the dog 
 They all tried to beat 
 But its been 14 years of silence 
 Its been 14 years of pain 
 Its been 14 years that are gone forever 
 And Ill never have again well 
 Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
 That Im to blame 
 Well theyre all usedup hasbeens 
 Out of the game 
 This time Ill have the last word 
 You hear what I say 
 I tried to see it your way 
 It wont work today 
 14 years 
 Thats what I say you know 
 Ive been the dealer 
 Hangin on your street 
 Bullshit and contemplation 
 Gossips their trade 
 If they knew half the real truth 
 What would they say 
 Well Im past the point of concern 
 Its time to play 
 These last four years of madness 
 Sure put me straight 
 Dont get back 14 years 
 In just one day 
 Just go away you know 
 Just like a hooker she said 
 Nothin for free 
 Oh I tried to see it your way 
 I tried to see it your wayOoh yeah 
 Ooh yeah 
 How could she look so fine 
 How could it be she might be mine 
 How could she be so cool 
 Ive been taken for a fool 
 So many times yeah 
 Its a story of a man 
 Works as hard as he can 
 Just to be a man who stands on his own 
 But the book always burns 
 As the story takes its turn 
 And leaves a broken man 
 How could she be so fine 
 I owe a favor to a friend 
 My friends they always come through for me yeah 
 As the story takes it turn 
 If you could only live my life 
 You could see the difference you make to me 
 To me 
 Id look right up at night 
 And all Id see was darkness 
 Now I see the stars alright 
 I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
 When the lights went down in your house 
 Yeah that made me happy 
 The sweat I make for you 
 Yeah I think you know where that comes from 
 Guitar come on 
 Yeah well Id look right up at night 
 I think you know where that comes from 
 How could she look so good 
 So good 
 YeahI dont have plans and schemes 
 And I dont have hopes and dreams 
 I I I dont have anything 
 Since I dont have you 
 And I dont have fond desires 
 And I dont have happy hours 
 I dont have anything 
 Happiness and I guess 
 I never will again 
 When you walked out on me 
 In walked old misery 
 And shes been here since then 
 Spoken Yeah were fucked 
 I dont have love to share 
 And I dont have one who cares 
 You you you oh oh 
 You you you oh yeahYeah 
 Attitude 
 Some fucking attitude 
 I cant believe what you say to me 
 You got some attitude 
 Inside that fetal brain 
 Theres got to be a whore 
 If you dont shut your mouth 
 Youre going to feel the floor yeah 
 Attitude what youve got 
 Attitude is what youve got 
 Yeah all right 
 Youre going to feel the motherfucking guitar 
 Oh attitude Attitude 
 Some fucking attitude Attitude 
 Oh attitude 
 Yeah 
 YeahBeen hidin out and layin low 
 Its nothing new to me 
 Well you can always find a place to go 
 If you can keep your sanity 
 They break down the doors and they rape my rights but 
 They wont touch me 
 They scream and yell and fight all night 
 You cant tell me 
 I lose my head I close my eyes 
 Cause I got somethin ve been buildin up inside 
 For so fuckin long 
 Theyre out ta get me 
 They wont catch me 
 Im fuckin innocent 
 They wont break me 
 Sometimes its easy to forget where youre goin 
 Sometimes its harder to leave 
 And evrytime you think you know just what youre doin 
 Thats when your troubles exceed 
 They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but 
 They preach and yell and fight all night 
 Cause I got somethin Ive been buildin up inside 
 Im already gone 
 Cause Im innocent 
 No no 
 Oh no no no no no no 
 No oh no no no 
 Let me see you try 
 Some people got a chip on their shoulder 
 And some would say it was me 
 But I didnt buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me 
 So Id be quick to disagree 
 So you can suck me 
 Take that one to heartBroken glass and cigarettes 
 Writing on the wall 
 It was a bargain for the summer 
 And I thought I had it all 
 I was the one who gave you everything 
 The one who took the fall 
 You were the one who would do anything 
 One who cant recall 
 Where she was while she was sleeping 
 In anothers womens bed 
 Or the doctors or the lawyers 
 Or the stranger that she met 
 If theres nothing that I can gain from this 
 Or anything at all 
 Itd be the knowledge that you gave me 
 When I thought Id heard it all 
 It was a long time for you 
 It was a long time for me 
 Itd be a long time for anyone 
 But looks like its meant to be 
 Social class and registers 
 Cocaine in the hall 
 All the way from California 
 On the way to your next call 
 To those nonnegotiations 
 To simulate a call 
 For the betterment of evils 
 And your ways around the laws 
 Thatd keep you up and sitting pretty 
 On a pedestal or bed 
 And now youre sleeping like an angel 
 Near the man who you gave head 
 If theres something I can make of this 
 Itd be the devil hates a loser 
 And you thought you had it all 
 It was the wrong time for you 
 It was the wrong time for me 
 It was the wrong time for everyone 
 But it looks like Im bout to see for myself 
 If I could go back in time to the place in my soul 
 There all alone 
 Lonely teardrops ooh are calling you 
 But I dont want to know it now 
 Cause knowing you it wont change a damn thing 
 But there was a time 
 Yeah there was a time 
 Didnt want to know it all 
 And I dont wanna know it now 
 I would do anything for you 
 There was a time 
 I would do anything for you ooh 
 I was there for you 
 And I dont wanna know it nowOn the road for forty days 
 Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze 
 Sweet sweet Connie  doin her act 
 She had the whole show and thats a natural fact 
 Up all night with Freddy King 
 I got to tell you pokers his thing 
 Abooze n ladies keep me right 
 As long as we can make it to the show tonight 
 Were an American band 
 Were coming to your town well help you party it down 
 Four young chaquitas in Omaha 
 Was waitin for the band to return from the show 
 Feelin good feelin right its Saturday night 
 The hotel detective  he was outasight 
 Now these fine ladies they had a plan 
 They was out to meet the boys in the band 
 They said Come on dudes lets get it on 
 And we proceeded to tear that hotel down 
 Were an American Band Oohooh 
 Were an American Band OohoohAh when all is said and done 
 Were not the only ones 
 Who look at life this way 
 Thats what the old folks say 
 But every time I see them 
 Makes me wish I had a gun 
 If I thought that I was crazy 
 Well I guess Id have more fun 
 Guess Id have more fun 
 Oooh the catcher in the rye again 
 Wont let you get away from him 
 Tomorrow never comes 
 Its just another day like today 
 You decide cause I dont have to 
 And then theyll find and I wont ask you 
 At anytime or long hereafter 
 If the cold outsides as Im imagining it to be oh 
 La na na na na na na 
 Ooh wont let you get away from him 
 When all is said and done 
 Thats what the young folks say 
 As if theyd ever change 
 As that who lie to say 
 Cause what used to bes not there for me 
 And ought to for someone 
 That belongs insane like I do 
 Lana nana na na na 
 Lana nana na nana 
 On an ordinary day 
 Not in an ordinary way 
 All at once the song I heard 
 No longer would it play 
 For anybody 
 Or anyone 
 That needed comfort from somebody 
 Needed comfort from someone 
 Who cared 
 To be 
 Not like you 
 And unlike me 
 And then the voices went away 
 From me 
 Somehow you set the wheels in motion 
 That haunt our memories 
 You were the instrument 
 You were the one 
 How a body took a body 
 You gave that boy a gun 
 You took our innocence 
 Behind our stares 
 Sometime the only thing 
 We counted on when no one else was there 
 Ah ah ah ah 
 Na na na na na naFound a head and an arm in the garbage can 
 Dont know why Im here 
 Livin on the run for oh so long 
 I gotta go collect 
 Double talkin jive 
 Get the money motherfucker 
 Cause I got no more patience 
 Double talkin lies 
 I got no more patience man 
 Back in town ana all new friends 
 They sayin how ya been 
 Fucked up and outta place 
 Thats how I felt back then 
 You dig what Im sayinHey you caught me in a coma 
 I dont think I wanna 
 Ever come back to this world again 
 Kinda like it in a coma 
 Cause no ones ever gonna 
 Oh make me come back to this world again 
 Now I feel as if Im floating away 
 I cant feel all the pressure and I like it this way 
 But my bodys callin 
 My bodys callin 
 Wont you come back to this world again 
 Suspended deep in a sea of black 
 Ive got the light at the end 
 Ive got the bones on the mast 
 Well Ive gone sailin 
 Ive gone sailin 
 I could leave so easily 
 While friends are calling back to me 
 I said theyre theyre leaving it all up to me 
 When all I needed was clarity and 
 Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on 
 Goddamn it 
 Slippin farther an farther away 
 Its a miracle how long we can stay 
 In a world our minds created 
 In a world thats full of shit 
 Help me 
 Bastard 
 Please understand me 
 Im climbing through the wreckage 
 Of all my twisted dreams 
 But this cheap investigation just 
 Cant stifle all my screams 
 And Im waitin at the crossroads 
 Waiting for you 
 Where are you 
 No ones gonna bother me anymore 
 No ones gonna mess with my head no more 
 I cant understand what all the fightins for 
 But its so nice here down off the shore 
 I wish you could see this cause theres nothing to see 
 Its peaceful here and its fine with me 
 Not like the world where I used to live 
 I never really wanted to live 
 Ahh 
 Okay were starting to lose this guy 
 Zap him again 
 Zap the son of a bitch again 
 Live your life like its a coma 
 Wont you tell me why wed wanna 
 With all the reasons you give its 
 Its kinda hard to believe 
 But who am I to tell you 
 That Ive seen any reason why you should stay 
 Maybe wed be better off without you anyway 
 Got a one way ticket on your last chance ride 
 Gotta one way ticket to your suicide 
 Gotta one way ticket and theres no way out alive 
 And all this crass communication 
 That has left you in the cold 
 Isnt much for consolation 
 When you feel so weak and old 
 But if home is where the heart is 
 Then theres stories to be told 
 No you dont need a doctor 
 No one else can heal your soul 
 Got your mind in submission 
 Got your life on the line 
 But nobody pulled the trigger 
 They just stepped aside 
 They be down by the water 
 While you watch em waving goodbye 
 They be callin in the morning 
 They be hangin on the phone 
 They be waiting for an answer 
 But you know nobodys home 
 And when the bell stopped ringing 
 It was nobodys fault but your own 
 There were always ample warnings 
 There were always subtle signs 
 And you would have seen it comin 
 But we gave you too much time 
 And when you said that no ones listening 
 Whyd your best friend drop a dime 
 Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
 For a way to spend our time 
 And its so easy to be social 
 Its so easy to be cool 
 Yeah its easy to be hungry 
 When you aint got shit to lose 
 And I wish that I could help you 
 With what you hope to find 
 But Im still out here waiting 
 Watching reruns of my life 
 When you reach the point of breaking 
 Know its gonna take some time 
 To heal the broken memories 
 That another man would need just to surviveI wont be told anymore 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm ooh 
 And left so far out from the shore 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore 
 Oh no I wont be told anymore 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm 
 Ooh and left so far out from the shore 
 Oh that I cant find my way back my way anymore 
 No I I I 
 Forgive them that tear down my soul 
 Bless them that they might grow old 
 Oh and free them so that they may know 
 That its never too late 
 For the many times what seemed like a memory 
 I searched and found the way you used to lure me in 
 Oh I found the ways to know why I had to be 
 Mired in denial and so afraid oh 
 If we ever find this true 
 That we have the strength to choose 
 Oh the freedom or the chains 
 We held together 
 Im gonna tell you a story 
 stand up for righteousness 
 what 
 stand up for justice 
 stand up for truth 
 How can a person grow up with all this around them 
 You gotta call on that something 
 where does it come from 
 that can make a way out of no way 
 All this hatred 
 what weve got here is 
 fear 
 that power that can make a way out of no way 
 failure to communicate 
 I tell ya Ive seen the lightning flash Ive heard the thunder roll 
 Everybodys acting like we can do anything and it dont matter what we do 
 Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than we even know 
 Sometimes 
 Hatred isnt something youre born with 
 I feel discouraged 
 It gets taught 
 Sometimes I feel discouraged 
 I felt this fear 
 He promised never to leave me 
 Never to leave me alone 
 No never alone No never alone 
 Lets get something straight alright 
 This whole thing was fucked up 
 never to leave me alone 
 All men betray All lose heart 
 I dont want to lose heartI want to believe 
 black men and white men together at the table of brotherhood I have a dream 
 Free at last free at last Thank the lord all mighty we are free at last 
 Oh I wont be told anymore If we ever find this true 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm That we have the strength to choose 
 And left so far out from the shore Oh the freedom or the chains 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore We held together 
 Oh no I wont be told anymore If we ever find this true 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore We held togetherLets drink to the hard working people 
 Lets drink to the lowly of birth 
 Raise your glass to the good and the evil 
 Lets drink to the salt of the earth 
 Say a prayer for the common foot soldier 
 Spare a thought for his back breaking work 
 Say a prayer for his wife and his children 
 Who burn the fires and who still till the earth 
 And when I search a faceless crowd 
 A swirling mass of gray and black and white 
 They dont look real to me 
 In fact they look so strange 
 Raise your glass to the hard working people 
 Lets drink to the uncounted heads 
 Lets think of the wandering millions 
 Who need leaders but get gamblers instead 
 Spare a thought for the stay at home voter 
 His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows 
 And a parade of the gray suited grafters 
 A choice of cancer or polio 
 Lets drink to the hard working people 
 Lets think of the lowly of birth 
 Spare a thought for the rag taggy people 
 Sets drink to the salt of the earth 
 Lets think of the two thousand million 
 Lets think of the humble of birthThis ones for you Johnny 
 It doesnt pay to try 
 All the smart boys know why 
 It doesnt mean I didnt try 
 I just never know why 
 It isnt cause Im all alone 
 Oh baby youre not home 
 And when Im home 
 Big deal Im still alone 
 Its so restless as I am 
 Beat my head against a pole 
 Try to knock some sense down side my bones 
 And even though I dont show 
 Those guys are so old 
 Cant put your arms around a memory 
 Dont try 
 Youre just a bastard kid 
 And you got no name 
 Could you live with me 
 Go on and say 
 And even though it dont show 
 Johnny youre me 
 Yeah your memory 
 I want to put my arms around your memory 
 I cant try 
 I cant try 
 Come on 
 LAMF 
 Like a motherfucker 
 Yo Johnny 
 What color were her eyes 
 Oh she was wearing shades 
 Fuck itYesterday 
 There was so many things I was never told 
 Now that Im startin to learn 
 I feel Im growing old 
 Cause yesterdays got nothin for me 
 Old pictures that Ill always see 
 Time just fades the pages 
 In my book of memories 
 Prayers in my pocket 
 And no hand in destiny 
 Ill keep on movin along 
 With no time to plant my feet 
 Some things could be better 
 If wed all just let them be 
 Yesterdays got nothin for me 
 Got nothin for me 
 Yesterday 
 There was so many things I was never shown 
 Suddenly this time I found 
 Im on the streets and Im all alone 
 I aint got time 
 To reminisce old novelties 
 YesterdayIf the world would end today 
 And all the dreams weve had would all just drift away ooh 
 You know theres nothing more to say 
 If the world would end and our love slip away ooh 
 I never knew the way that you look at me 
 Would ever mean so much to me 
 But in my heart I found the feelins that Ive never shown 
 And now theyve got the best of me 
 If the world would end today 
 Oooh 
 La la da da la da da da da da 
 I never thought all the love I was lookin for 
 Could ever be so close to me 
 But youre the only one I have ever loved that has ever loved me 
 And now youve got the best of me 
 And all the dreams we had would all just slip away ooh 
 And all the dreams we had would all just drift away ooh 
 If the world would end and our love slipped away 
 If the world would end and our love slipped awayMy heart is full of love for you

 Ah ah ah 
 Riad N The Bedouins 
 Had a plan and thought theyd win 
 But I dont give a fuck bout them 
 Cause I am crazy 
 Oh my salvation 
 All my frustrations 
 Caught in the lies no one had wove as well 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell ooh 
 Say thats a war that you cant win 
 But I have had enough of them 
 And who can blame me 
 Sent down on desert winds 
 Nomads and barbarians 
 I wont bend my will to them 
 You aggravate me 
 And all my frustrations 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell oh 
 Ah ah 
 Had a plan and though theyd win 
 Crossed the line and lost againWanna tell you a story 
 Bout a woman I know 
 When it comes to lovin 
 Oh she steals the show 
 She aint exactly pretty 
 Aint exactly small 
 Fortytwo thirtynine fiftysix 
 You could say shes got it all 
 Never had a woman 
 Never had a woman like you 
 Doing all the things 
 Doing all the things you do 
 Aint no fairy story 
 Aint no skin and bone 
 But you give it all you got 
 Weighing in at nineteen stone 
 Youre a whole lotta woman 
 A whole lotta woman 
 Whole lotta Rosie 
 And youre a whole lotta woman 
 Oh honey you can do it 
 Do it to me all night long 
 Only one to turn 
 Only one to turn me on 
 All through the night time 
 And right around the clock 
 To my surprise 
 Rosie never stopsI know youve been dreaming bout the times in our lives 
 But Ive been screaming in my bed late at night 
 A space a little little and your stack of pain 
 Makes it grip that skull to me child that youll stay 
 Youve been in my life so long can I get through to you 
 I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
 Theres something I need to say before its to late 
 But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay 
 Just another Sunday 
 Oh yaaa just another Sunday 
 Just another Sunday oh yaaa 
 Theres too many games in a day for a simple man to face 
 That desperate moment in your life where you cant be afraid 
 Dont think your second chance will break around the bend 
 Cause hearts dont always share love or the person on the other 
 End 
 But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay ya 
 Just another Sunday yaa 
 Just another Sunday oh baby 
 Its only one more Sunday 
 Those are tickets for the same plane bring it back to me 
 Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery 
 Take a walk away wont end the carousel 
 But if walking away can bring you back then I wish you well 
 Its just another Sunday 
 Its just another 
 Just another oh yaa 
 Just another SundayBuick

 Takin your last ride

 Better be so careful or youll be dead before your time 
 Too soon you thought  
 Too late for the pressure and strain 
 Too bad for those who dont believe it

 Would you please leave me alive 
 Ooh

 Ooh YeahYou wanna step into my world 
 Its a sociopsychotic state of bliss 
 Youve been delayed in the real world 
 How many times have you hit and missed 
 You catscan shows disfiguration 
 I wanna laugh myself to death 
 With a misfired synapse with a bent configuration 
 Ill hold the line while you gasp for breath 
 You wanna talk to me So talk to me 
 You dont understand your sex 
 You aint been mindfucked yet 
 Lets do it 
 Oh my distorted smile 
 Guess what Im doing nowIm a cold heartbreaker fit to burn 
 And Ill rip your heart in two 
 And Ill leave you lying on the bed 
 Ill be out the door before you wake 
 Its nothing new to you 
 Cause I think weve seen that movie too 
 Cause you could be mine 
 But youre way out of line 
 With your bitch slap rapping 
 And your cocaine tongue 
 You get nothing done 
 I said you could be mine 
 Now holidays come and then they go 
 Its nothing new today 
 Collect another memory 
 When I come home late at night 
 Dont ask me where Ive been 
 Just count your stars Im home again 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine mine mine mine 
 Youve gone sketching too many times 
 Ooh why dont you give it a rest 
 Why must you find 
 Another reason to cry 
 While youre breaking down my back and Ive been racking out my brain 
 It dont matter how we make it cause it always ends the same 
 You can push it for more mileage but your flaps are wearing thin 
 And I could sleep on it till morning but this nightmare never ends 
 Dont forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands 
 And you can take the pity so far but its more than I can stand 
 Cause this couch trips getting older tell me how long has it been 
 Cause five years is forever and you havent grown up yet 
 I said you could be 
 You should be 
 Oh you could be mine 
 YeahYour daddy works in porno 
 Now that mommys not around 
 She used to love her heroin 
 But now shes underground 
 So you stay out late at night 
 And you do your coke for free 
 Drivin your friends crazy 
 With your lifes insanity 
 Well well well you just cant tell 
 Well well well my Michelle 
 Look out 
 Sowin all your wild oats 
 In anothers luxuries 
 Yesterday was Tuesday 
 Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
 But school starts much too early 
 And this hotel wasnt free 
 So party till your connection calls 
 Honey Ill return the key 
 Well well well you never can tell 
 Everyone needs love 
 You know that its true 
 Someday youll find someone 
 Thatll fall in love with you 
 But oh the time it takes 
 When youre all alone 
 That you can call your own 
 But till then you better 
 Now youre clean and so discreet 
 I wont say a word 
 But most of all this song is true 
 Case you havent heard 
 So cmon and stop your cryin 
 We both know money burns 
 Honey dont stop tryin 
 And youll get what you deserve 
 My my my Michelle 
 Ooh my my my Michelle 
 My my my my my my my my Michelle

 Welcome to the jungle

 In the jungle 
 Watch it bring you to your 
 Shanananananananananananaknees knees 
 Wha I I wanna watch you bleed 
 We take it day by day 
 If you want it youre gonna bleed 
 But its the price you pay

 You can taste the bright lights 
 But you wont get them for free 
 Feel my my my my serpentine 
 Wha I I wanna hear you scream 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 It gets worse here every day 
 You learn to live like an animal 
 In the jungle where we play 
 If you got a hunger for what you see 
 Youll take it eventually 
 You can have anything you want 
 But you better not take it from me 
 Wha Im gonna watch you bleed 
 And when youre high you never 
 Ever want to come down 
 So down so down so down 
 Yeah hey hey hey hey hey hey aoh 
 You know where you are 
 Youre in the jungle baby 
 Youre gonna die 
 Feel my oh my my my serpentine 
 Down in the jungle 
 Its gonna bring you down huhIt aint easy livin like a gypsy 
 Tell ya honey how it feels 
 Ive been dreamin floatin down stream 
 And losin touch with all thats real 
 Whole lotta lover keepin undercover 
 Never knowin where you beenOoh yeah 
 Youve been fadin always out paradin 
 Keep in touch with mama kin 
 You always got your tail on the wag 
 Spittin fire from your mouth 
 Just like a dragon 
 You act like a perpetual drag 
 You better check it out 
 Cause someday soon 
 Youll have to climb back on the wagon 
 It aint easy livin like you wanna 
 Its so hard to find piece of mind 
 Yes it is 
 The way I see it 
 You got to say shit 
 But dont forget to drop me a line 
 Bald as an egg at eighteen 
 And workin for daddys such a drag 
 You still stuff your mouth 
 With his beans 
 You better check it out or someday soon 
 Keep in touch with mama kin 
 Tell her where you gone and been 
 Livin out your fantasy 
 Sleepin late and smokin tea 
 Sleepin late and suckin me oh no 
 And workin for daddys just a drag 
 Sleepin late and suckin me 
 Oh ow ow ow yeah owIt dont really matter 
 Youre gonna leave this thing to somebody else 
 If they were missionaries 
 Real time visionaries 
 Sittin in a Chinese stew 
 To view my disinfatuation 
 Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on now 
 Cause it would take a lot more hate than you 
 To end the fascination 
 Even with an iron fist 
 But all I got is precious time 
 Guess Ill keep it to myself 
 Said it dont really matter 
 Each time Ill cry for somebody else 
 Cause it would take a lot more time than you 
 Have got for masturbation 
 But all we got is precious time 
 More than you got to fool a nation 
 Ill guess youll find out for yourself 
 So you can hear it now from somebody else 
 And if you beat em enough theyll die 
 Its like a walk in the park to the cells 
 And now youre keeping your own kind in hell 
 And when your great wall rots blame yourself 
 And youre out of timeTheres a time for a living 
 Time keeps on flying 
 Think youre loving baby 
 But all youre doing is crying 
 Can you feel 
 Are those feelings real 
 Look at your game girl 
 What a mad delusion 
 Living in that confusion 
 Frustration and doubt 
 Can you ever live without the game 
 The sad sad game 
 Mad game 
 Just to say loves not enough 
 Even it cant be true 
 Oh you can tell those lies baby but youre only fooling you 
 Go on look at your game girl 
 And if you cant feel 
 And those feelings aint real 
 Then you better stop tryin 
 Or your gonna play cryin 
 Stop tryin 
 Thats the game 
 Sad sad game 
 Sad game 
 spoken 
 Thanks Charles 
 JackAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 Oh to make you change your mind 
 You know I wouldnt want to be you 
 So now I wander through my days 
 And try to find my ways 
 To the feelings that I felt 
 I saved for you and no one else 
 And though as long as this road seems 
 I know its called the street of dreams 
 But thats not stardust on my feet 
 It leaves a taste thats bittersweet 
 Though its what you planned this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore 
 You know its what you planned this much is true oh oh 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore oh oh ah 
 Is more than I know you believe 
 What I thought of you now 
 Has cost more that it should for me 
 What I thought was true before 
 Were lies I couldnt see 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Is only memories 
 Oh oh oh whatd I tell you 
 Oh oh oh thats what I tell you 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh inside of youTell everybody that I am sorry truly sorry 
 For all the wrong Ive done 
 I never meant to hurt nobody no no 
 Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 And I have lied and I have begged and I have cheated 
 And I know my ship it wont be coming in 
 And as I lay me down to take my rest 
 I can see that its just dust in the wind 
 Take hold my hand and hold it tighter ever tighter 
 You must believe that I love you still 
 But my strength it grows weaker and weaker 
 And my body has lost its will 
 Cause I have lied and I have begged and I have cheated 
 Oh Lord I have lost once again 
 And theres no one to help me find my way home 
 Lord and I Lord I never want to hurt nobody 
 And I Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 I can see that its just dust in the windListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 Thrown down in the gutter its more than you deserve 
 Kneeling fucking virgin you know thats what you are 
 Pussy for a maggot isnt that a shock 
 What can I do With a bitch like you 
 All I have I ask of you 
 Ill be dammed 
 If its not true 
 A bitch like you 
 Get your head down in the sky 
 Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart 
 Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are 
 Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart 
 A bitch like youSick of this life 
 Not that youd care 
 Im not the only one with 
 Whom these feelings I share 
 Nobody understands 
 Quite why were here 
 Were searchin for answers 
 That never appear 
 But maybe if I looked real hard Id 
 Id see your tryin too 
 To understand this life 
 That were all goin through 
 Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car 
 I didnt know what to do 
 Woah 
 Sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse 
 And I dont know why youd be bringin me down 
 Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more 
 It may sound funny but youd think by now 
 Id be smilin 
 I guess some things never change ooh 
 Never change 
 I met an old cowboy 
 I saw the look in his eyes 
 Somethin tells me hes been here before 
 Cause experience makes you wise 
 I was only a small child 
 When the thought first came to me 
 That Im a son of a gun and the gun of a son 
 That brought back the devil in me 
 Ooh sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse 
 I guess some things never change 
 I aint quite what youd call an old soul 
 Still wet behind the ears 
 I been around this track a couple of times 
 But now the dust is startin to clear oh yeah 
 I dont know why youd be bringin me down 
 Ooh yeah Id be smilin 
 No way Id be smilin 
 Ooh smilin 
 Sick of this life 
 Whom these feelings I shareTold you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but theyll never find 
 That its all right yes its all right 
 Where to go Where to see 
 Its always been that way and it can never be 
 But its all right yes its all right 
 Give it all and ask for no return 
 And very soon youll see and youll begin to learn 
 Dont you know that its so good for you 
 You can be making love and see it all go through 
 But its all right cause it all right 
 So I told you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but theyll never find it 
 Its all right cause its all rightListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 A bitch like youMy child arrived just the other day 
 Came to the world in the usual way 
 But there were planes to catch and bills to pay 
 He learned to walk while I was away 
 He was talkin fore I knew it 
 And as he grew he said 
 Im gonna be like you Dad 
 You know Im gonna be like you 
 And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon 
 When you comin home 
 Son I dont know when but well get together then 
 You know well have a good time then 
 My son turned ten just the other day 
 He said Thanks for the ball Dad Come on lets play 
 Can you teach me to throw 
 I said Not today I got a lot to do 
 He said Thats okay 
 And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said 
 You know Im gonna be like him yeah 
 You know Im gonna be like him 
 Well he came from college just the other day 
 So much like a man I just had to say 
 Son Im proud of you Can you sit for a while 
 He shook his head and he said with a smile 
 What Id really like Dad is to borrow the car keys 
 See you later Can I have them please 
 Ive long since retired my sons moved away 
 I called him up just the other day 
 I said Id like to see you if you dont mind 
 He said Id love to Dad if I could find the time 
 You see my new jobs a hassle and the kids have the flu 
 But its sure nice talkin to you Dad 
 Its been sure nice talkin to you 
 And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me 
 Hed grown up just like me 
 My boy was just like meAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 Or the innocence inside 
 You know I wouldnt wanna be you 
 So now I wander through my daze 
 Trying to find my ways 
 Although its what we planned 
 This much is true 
 Dont live inside of you anymore 
 Has cost more than it should for me 
 Was only memoriesWell since my baby left me 
 I found a new place to dwell 
 Its down at the end of lonely street 
 At Heartbreak Hotel 
 You make me so lonely baby 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely I could die 
 And although its always crowded 
 You still can find some room 
 Where broken hearted lovers 
 Do cry away their gloom 
 Well the Bell hops tears keep flowin 
 And the desk clerks dressed in black 
 Well they been so long on lonely street 
 They aint ever gonna look back 
 Hey now if your baby leaves you 
 And you got a tale to tell 
 Just take a walk down lonely street 
 To Heartbreak HotelIts not how youre thinking 
 Or as youve imagined 
 Youve been living in the shade of 
 Beliefs that were fashioned 
 To keep you in slavery and drain out your soul 
 But what can I do when theres so many liars 
 That crawl through your veins 
 Like millions of spiders 
 That seek out their victims 
 And ruin the wiser 
 Watch out 
 Gotcha 
 Oh my god 
 I cant deny this 
 Ive been taught just to kill and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
 Like nobody wanted to know 
 So give it away 
 Like theyre not gonna fuck you 
 How long can you bear him 
 To come back and haunt you 
 To burn past your feelings 
 And cause you to suffer 
 Youre starting to bleed 
 They dont give you up 
 Before its too late 
 What will you offer 
 In way of a healing 
 Im so confused abused misused 
 Like nobody wouldnt know 
 Ooh if it opens your eyes 
 This is better than a strong compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
 If only you had let me know 
 This is better than the last compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shadows 
 And they wont give in 
 Cause they know what theyre after 
 A kick in the face 
 Like its all that would matter 
 Oh 
 Ive been taught just to murder and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
 Cause nobody wouldnt know 
 This is better than a good compromise 
 Ooh well its on with the show 
 Like the tide down on the ocean 
 The waves already set in motion 
 The only one in the game thats lost is youWell shes all geared up walking down the street 
 And I can feel the slime dripping down her sleeve 
 Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes going to do 2x 
 Well its late at night and Im all alone 
 And I can hear her boots as shes near her home 
 Scratch scratch shes clawing at the door 
 Whoa no I cant take it anymore 
 Crack crack Im feeling so sore 
 I never should asked for black leather 
 Black leather 
 Ooh black leather 
 Ow black leather 
 And you can try to hide but you wont get far 
 You can let her in and youll start again 
 Black leatherAll I need is some inspiration 
 Before I do somebody some harm 
 I feel just like a vegetable 
 Down here on the farm 
 Nobody comes to see me 
 Nobody here to turn me on 
 I aint even got a lover 
 They told me to get healthy 
 They told me to get some sun 
 But boredom eats me like catsup 
 Drinking lemonade shanty 
 Aint no body gonna do me harm 
 But Im like a fish out of water 
 I write a thousand letters 
 Till my fingers all gone numb 
 But I never see no postman 
 I call my baby on the telephone 
 I say come down and have some fun 
 But she knows what the score is 
 I cant fall in love with a wheat field 
 I cant fall in love with a barn 
 When everything smells like horse shit 
 Blue skies and swimming pools 
 Add so much charm 
 But Id rather be back in Soho 
 Than down here on the farm 
 On the fucking farm 
 Are you born in a fucking barn or what 
 BaaaaaaDont you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Dont you try to stop us now 
 Cause I just wont let you 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 The world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with 
 An endless monotony 
 Theres nothing thats stopping me 
 All things are possible 
 I am unstoppable 
 Some may convince you 
 No one can break through 
 Im here to tell you 
 Youre worth more than they tell you 
 My lifes a catastrophe 
 Cant understand why 
 It seems like it has to be 
 Its all opened up for me 
 Nothings impossible 
 I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you 
 Do what they want to 
 You know youre stronger 
 Than the lies that they tell you 
 Id give anything to know 
 I would have never made it so far 
 How you live with yourself 
 All by myself 
 Believe in yourselfDont damn me 
 When I speak a piece of my mind 
 Cause silence isnt golden 
 When Im holding it inside 
 Cause Ive been where I have been 
 And Ive seen what I have seen 
 I put the pen to the paper 
 Cause its all a part of me 
 Be it a song or casual conversation 
 To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations 
 Your words once heard they can place you in a faction 
 My words may disturb but at least theres a reaction 
 Sometimes I wanna kill 
 Sometimes I wanna die 
 Sometimes I wanna destroy 
 Sometimes I wanna cry 
 Sometimes I could get even 
 Sometimes I could give up 
 Sometimes I could give 
 Sometimes I never give a fuck 
 Its only for a while 
 I hope you understand 
 I never wanted this to happen 
 Didnt want to be a man 
 So I hid inside my world 
 I took what I could find 
 I cried when I was lonely 
 I fell down when I was blind 
 But dont damn me 
 An Ive seen what I have seen 
 How can I ever satisfy you 
 And how can I ever make you see 
 That deep inside were all somebody 
 And it dont matter who you wanna be 
 But now I gotta smile 
 I hope you comprehend 
 For this man can say it happened 
 Cause this child has been condemned 
 So I stepped into your world 
 I kicked you in the mind 
 And Im the only witness 
 To the nature of my crime 
 But look at what weve done 
 To the innocent and young 
 Whoa listen to whos talking 
 Cause were not the only ones 
 The trash collected by the eyes 
 And dumped into the brain 
 Said it tears into our conscious thoughts 
 You tell me whos to blame 
 I know you dont wanna hear me cryin 
 And I know you dont wanna hear me deny 
 That your satisfaction lies in your illusions 
 But your delusions are yours and not mine 
 We take for granted we know the whole story 
 We judge a book by its cover and read what we want 
 Between selected lines 
 Dont hail me 
 And dont idolize the ink 
 Or Ive failed in my intentions 
 Can you find the missing link 
 Your only validation 
 Is living your own life 
 Vicarious existence 
 Is a fucking waste of time 
 So I send this song to the offended 
 I said what I meant and Ive never pretended 
 As so many others do intending just to please 
 If I damned your point of view could you turn the other cheek 
 Dont damn me 
 I said dont damn me 
 I said dont hail me 
 Smoke em if you got em 
 Alright that suckedOh 
 Dont you try and stop us now 
 Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with an endless monotony 
 Sometimes I feel like theres nothing thats stopping me 
 All things are possible I am unstoppable 
 So they convince you no one can break through 
 Im here to tell you youre worth more than they tell you 
 Sometimes I feel like my lifes a catastrophe 
 Cant understand why it seems like it has to be 
 Sometimes I feel like its all opened up for me 
 Nothings impossible I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you do what they want to 
 You know youre stronger than the lies that they tell you 
 Believe in yourselfI got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I said I dont know what I did 
 But I know I gotta move 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 I cant wait here forever 
 I got too much here to lose 
 An now youre blowin smoke 
 I think youre one big joke 
 Me I gotta lot to learn 
 And Im still waitin for the heads to turn 
 You say I walk a line 
 Fuck they move it every time 
 You walk a mile in my shoes 
 And then you tell me bout singin the blues 
 Oh you get what you pay for 
 And freedoms real high priced 
 And while your rippin off children 
 Somebodys fuckin your wife 
 Its never made a difference 
 Its only how you survive 
 And now you ask me why 
 I said its do or die 
 Ill stick it right in your face 
 And then Ill put you in your motherfuckin place 
 And you you can suck my ass 
 I think its so low class 
 Me Im just so concerned 
 Im still waitin for your ass to burn 
 Oh you want a confrontation 
 Ill give you every fuckin chance 
 With your verbal masturbation 
 Me I just like to dance 
 Hows that for provocation 
 Im just makin a stance 
 And Im tired of the frustration 
 Of livin inside of your lies 
 And Im wired on indignation 
 I said somebodys got to die 
 Listen motherfucker 
 Youre about to pay your dues 
 If youre goin up against me 
 Dont you know youre gonna lose 
 I know 
 You think anyone with an IQ over 15 would believe your shit Fuckhead 
 Nothin but a fuckin pussyIts all the same only the names will change 
 Everyday it seems were wasting away 
 Another place where the faces are so cold 
 Id drive all night just to get back home 
 Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride 
 Im wanted dead or alive 
 Wanted dead or alive 
 Sometimes I sleep sometimes its not for days 
 And the people I meet always go their separate ways 
 Sometimes you tell the day 
 By the bottle that you drink 
 And times when youre alone all you do is think 
 Im wanted wanted dead or alive 
 Wanted wanted dead or alive 
 And I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back 
 I play for keeps cause I might not make it back 
 Ive been everywhere oh yeah still Im standing tall 
 Ive seen a million faces and Ive rocked them all 
 Cause Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride 
 And Im a cowboy I got the night on my side 
 And Im wanted wanted dead or alive 
 And Im right and Im right dead or alive 
 I still drive I still drive dead or alive 
 Dead or alive 
 Dead or aliveIm your top prime cut of meat Im your choice 
 I wanna be elected 
 Im your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce 
 Kids want a savior dont need a fake 
 Were all gonna rock to the rules that I make 
 I wanna be elected elected elected 
 Good evening Mr  Mrs America and all ships at sea 
 The candidate is taking the country by storm 
 I never lied to you Ive always been cool 
 I gotta get the vote and I told you bout school

 Everyone in the United States of America

 Respected selected call collected

 And if I am elected 
 I promise the formation of a new party 
 A third party the Wild Party 
 I know we have problems 
 We got problems right here in Central City 
 We have problems on the North South East and West 
 New York City Saint Louis Philadelphia Los Angeles Detroit Chicago 
 Everybody has problems 
 And personally I dont careIts a critical solution 
 And the east coast got the blues 
 Its a mass of confusion 
 Like the lies they sell to you 
 You got a glass jawed toothache 
 Of a mental disease 
 An they be runnin round back 
 See em line up on their knees 
 Cause the kiss ass sycophants 
 Throwin penance at your feet 
 When they got nowhere to go 
 Watch em come in off the streets 
 While theyre bangin out front 
 Inside their slammin to the crutch 
 Go on an throw me to the lions 
 And the whole damn screamin bunch 
 Cause the pissedoff ripoffs 
 R everywhere you turn 
 Tell me how a generations 
 Ever sposed to learn 
 This fire is burnin 
 And its out of control 
 Its not a problem you can stop 
 Its rock n roll 
 I read it on a wall 
 It went straight to my head 
 It said Dance to the tension 
 of a world on edge 
 We got racial violence 
 And wholl cast the first stone 
 And sex is used anyway it can be 
 Sometimes when I look out 
 Its hard to see the day 
 Its a feelin you can have it 
 Its not mine to take away 
 Lost in the garden of Eden 
 Said were lost in the garden of Eden 
 And theres no ones gonna believe this 
 But were lost in the garden of Eden 
 Suck on that 
 Looking through this point of view 
 Theres no way Im gonna fit in 
 Dont ya tell me what my eyes see 
 Dont ya tell me who to believe in 
 I aint superstitious 
 But I know when somethings wrong 
 Ive been draggin my heels 
 With a bitch called hope 
 Let the undercurrent drag me along 
 Most organized religions make 
 A mockery of humanity 
 Our governments are dangerous 
 And out of control 
 The garden of Eden is just another graveyard 
 Said if they had someone to buy it 
 Said Im sure theyd sell my soul 
 An we aint talkin about no poison apple or some missin rib ya hear 
 Its rock n rollShes got a smile that it seems to me 
 Reminds me of childhood memories 
 Where everything was as fresh 
 As the bright blue sky 
 Now and then when I see her face 
 She takes me away to that special place 
 And if I stare too long 
 Id probably break down and cry 
 Woah oh oh sweet child o mine 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet love of mine 
 Shes got eyes of the bluest skies 
 And if they thought of rain 
 Id hate to look into those eyes 
 And see an ounce of pain 
 Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
 Where as a child Id hide 
 And pray for the thunder and the rain 
 To quietly pass me by 
 Oh oh yeah 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine 
 Woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine ooh yeah 
 Ooh sweet love of mine 
 Where do we go 
 Where do we go now 
 Mm where do we go Where do we go Where do we go 
 Where do we go now Where do we go 
 Where do we go Sweet child 
 Mm where do we go now 
 Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye Where do we go 
 Ooh where do we go now 
 Where do we go 
 Ahh where do we go now 
 Oh where do we go 
 Where do we go now 
 Now now now now now now now 
 Sweet child 
 Sweet child o mineImagine theres no heaven 
 Its easy if you try 
 No hell below us 
 Above us only sky 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living for today 
 Imagine theres no countries 
 It isnt hard to do 
 Nothing to kill or die for 
 And no religion too 
 Living life in peace 
 You may say Im a dreamer 
 But Im not the only one 
 I hope someday youll join us 
 And the world will be as one 
 Imagine no possessions 
 I wonder if you can 
 No need for greed or hunger 
 A brotherhood of man 
 Sharing all the world 
 And the world will live as oneBuddy youre a boy make a big noise

 I can see a love restrained 
 But darling when I hold you 
 Dont you know I feel the same yeah 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 And we both know hearts can change 
 And its hard to hold a candle 
 In the cold November rain 
 Weve been through this such a long long time 
 Just trying to kill the pain ooh yeah 
 But lovers always come and lovers always go 
 And no ones really sure whos letting go today walking away 
 If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
 I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine all mine 
 So if you want to love me 
 Then darling dont refrain 
 Or Ill just end up walking 
 Do you need some time on your own 
 Do you need some time all alone 
 Ooh everybody needs some time on their own 
 Ooh dont you know you need some time all alone 
 I know its hard to keep an open heart 
 When even friends seem out to harm you 
 But if you could heal a broken heart 
 Wouldnt time be out to charm you Oh 
 Sometimes I need some time on my own 
 Sometimes I need some time all alone 
 And when your fears subside 
 And shadows still remain ooh yeah 
 I know that you can love me 
 When theres no one left to blame 
 So nevermind the darkness 
 We still can find a way 
 Even cold November rain 
 Dont you think that you need somebody 
 Dont you think that you need someone 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 Youre not the only one 
 Everybody needs somebodyMy heart is full of love for you 
 I wanna get right next to you

 After she makes me buttfuck her 
 Cornshucker 
 Gonna stick my dick 
 Right up her ass 
 Gimme a dime 
 Gotta call my pimp 
 When I heard her ask 
 It made me go limp 
 Two weeks later 
 My sex life was drab 
 Instead of a wang 
 All I had was a scab 
 If youre sleazy 
 You better think Im first 
 Cause Ive got a dick like liverwurst 
 Gonna watch my dick 
 As I make her butt pucker 
 Hey hey hey hey hey

 I like the way that KY greases your lipsWell when youre sitting there 
 In your silk upholstered chair 
 Talking to some rich folks that you know 
 Well I hope you wont see me 
 In my ragged company 
 You know I could never be alone 
 Take me down little Susie take me down 
 I know you think youre the Queen of the Underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I wont forget to put roses on your grave 
 Well when youre sitting back 
 In your rose pink Cadillac 
 Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day 
 Ill be in my basement room 
 With a needle and a spoon 
 And another girl to take my pain away 
 Say it with dead flowers at my wedding 
 No I wont forget to put roses on your graveChildhood living is easy to do 
 The things you wanted 
 I bought them for you graceless lady 
 You know who I am 
 You know I cant let you slide through my hand 
 Wild horses 
 Couldnt drag me away 
 Wild wild horses 
 I watched you suffer 
 A dull aching pain 
 Now youre decided 
 To show me the same 
 No sweeping exits 
 Or offstage lines 
 Could make me feel bitter 
 Or treat you unkind 
 I know Ive dreamed you 
 A sin n a lie 
 I have my freedom 
 But I dont have much time 
 Faith has been broken 
 Tears must be cried 
 Lets do some living 
 After we die 
 Couldnt drag me awayTook my chances carelessly 
 Choked on my own cigarette 
 You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby 
 But you aint seen the worst yet 
 Now Im reckless gonna have some fun 
 And the woman who is dead 
 Who was out alnight no Im not the only one 
 And I aint standing never standing 
 In the shadow of your love 
 Shadow of your love 
 Wrote my changes helplessly 
 Yeah but I got no regrets 
 Money it was on the table 
 So I booked with all the bets 
 Living like a lemon aint so hot 
 And you aint my idea 
 Of one highrollin shot 
 No I aint standing never standing 
 Big dark clouds hanging over your head 
 Hope youve heard baby all Ive said 
 Youve been told what Ive said 
 No use crying youre as good as dead 
 And the woman who is dead who is out all right 
 Now Im not the only one 
 And I aint standing never standingShe hit town like a rose in bloom 
 Smellin sweet said sweet perfume 
 The color faded and the petals died 
 Down in the city no one cried 
 In the streets the garbage lies 
 Protected by a million flies 
 The roaches so big 
 You know that they got bones 
 They moved in and made a tenement home 
 I said nice boys 
 Dont play rock and roll 
 Nice boys dont play rock and roll 
 Im not a nice boy 
 Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
 Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
 She met the man and she did the smack 
 Paid the price layin flat on her back 
 Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
 They ended up just being a toy 
 Played so hard burned her life away 
 Lies were told no promises made 
 You know nice boys 
 Im not a nice boy and I never was 
 Young and fresh when she hit town 
 Hot for kicks just to get around 
 But now she lays in a filthy room 
 She kills the pain with 
 A flick and a spoon 
 And in the streets the garbage lies 
 You know the roaches so big 
 Moved in and made a tenement home 
 No no no no no no no no baby 
 I bet you mama said 
 Nice boys dont play rock and roll 
 Nice boysYou like to hurt me you know that you do 
 You like to think in some way that its me and not you 
 you know it isnt true 
 You like to have me jump and be good but I dont want to do it 
 You dont know why I wont act the way you think I should 
 You thought theyd make me behave and submit 
 What were you thinking 
 Cause I dont forget 
 You dont know why I wont give in 
 To hell with the pressure Im not caving in 
 You know that I got under your skin 
 You sold your soul but I wont let you win 
 You talk too much you say I do 
 Difference is nobody cares about you 
 Youve got all the answers 
 You know everything 
 Why nobody asked you 
 Is a mystery to me 
 Im sorry for you 
 Not sorry for me 
 not sorry for me 
 You dont know who in the hell to or not to believe 
 or not to believe 
 Im sorry for you 
 You dont know who you can trust now or you should believe 
 You should believe 
 You close your eyes all well and good 
 Ill kicked your ass like I said that I would 
 You tell them stories theyd rather believe 
 Use and confuse them theyre numb and naive 
 Truth is the truth hurts Dont you agree 
 Its harder to live with the truth about you than to live with the lies about me 
 Nobody owes you 
 Not one god damn thing 
 You know where to put your 
 Just shut up and sing 
 You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free 
 Wont set them free 
 You know you 
 Anyone else should be sorry for you 
 Youve got no heart 
 You cant see all that youve done for me 
 I know the reasons you tear me apartI said baby you been lookin real good 
 You know that I remember when we met 
 Funny how I never felt so good 
 Its a feelin that I know

 I think its something each persons sposed to take in their own special way 
 Fucking bitchPlease allow me to introduce myself 
 Im a man of wealth and taste 
 Ive been around for a long long year 
 Stole many a mans soul and faith 
 And I was round when Jesus Christ 
 Had his moment of doubt and pain 
 Made damn sure that Pilate 
 Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guess my name 
 But whats puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game 
 I stuck around St Petersberg 
 When I saw it was a time for a change 
 Killed the Czar and his ministers 
 Anastasia screamed in vain 
 I rode a tank 
 Held a generals rank 
 When the Blitzkrieg raged 
 And the bodies stank 
 Hope you guess my name oh yeah 
 Whats puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game oh yeah 
 I watched with glee 
 While your kings and queens 
 Fought for ten decades 
 For the Gods they made 
 I shouted out 
 Who killed the Kennedys 
 When after all 
 It was you and me 
 Let me please introduce myself 
 And I laid traps for troubadors 
 Who could kill me in vain 
 Hope you guessed my name oh yeah 
 Is the nature of my game oh yeah get down baby 
 But whats confusing you 
 Is just the nature of my game 
 Just as every cop is a criminal 
 And all the sinners saints 
 As heads is tails 
 Just call me Lucifer 
 Cause Im in need of some restraint 
 So if you meet me 
 Have some courtesy 
 Have some sympathy and some taste 
 Use all your welllearned politesse 
 Or Ill lay your soul to waste um yeah 
 Hope you guessed my name um yeah 
 Is the nature of my game um baby get down 
 Woo who 
 Oh yeah get on down 
 Oh yeah 
 Tell me baby whats my name 
 Tell me honey baby guess my name 
 I tell you one time youre to blame 
 Ooh who

 Goodbye evrybody Ive got to go 
 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth 
 Mama ooh I dont want to die 
 I sometimes wish Id never been born at all 
 I see a little silhouetto of a man 
 Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango 
 Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightning me 
 Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo figaro 
 Magnifico Im just a poor boy and nobody loves me 
 Hes just a poor boy from a poor family 
 Spare him his life from this monstrosity 
 Easy come easy go will you let me go

 So you think you can love me and leave me to die 
 Oh baby cant do this to me baby 
 Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here 
 Nothing really matters Anyone can see

 Well aint it fun when youve broken up every band that youve ever begun 
 Aint it fun when you know that youre going to die young 
 Such funIll take a nicotine caffeine sugar fix 
 Jesus dont ya git tired of turnin tricks 
 But when your innocence dies youll find the blues 
 Seems all our heroes were born to lose 
 Just walkin through time you believe this heat 
 Another empty house another dead end street 
 Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell 
 This side of heaven this close to Hell 
 Right next door to hell 
 Why dont you write a letter to me 
 I said Im right next door to hell 
 And so many eyes are on me 
 I got nowhere else to be 
 Feels like the walls are closing in on me 
 My mama never really said much to me 
 She was much too young and scared to be 
 Hell Freud might say thats what I need 
 But all I really ever get is greed 
 And most my friends they feel the same 
 Hell we dont even have ourselves to blame 
 But times are hard and thrills are cheaper 
 As your arms get shorter your pockets get deeper 
 I never thought this is where Id be 
 But Im right next door to hell 
 Thinkin timell stand still for me 
 Fuck you 
 Bitch 
 Not bad kids just stupid ones 
 Yeah we thought wed own the world 
 And gettin used was havin fun 
 I said were not sad kids just lucid ones yeah 
 Flowin through life not collectin anyone 
 So much out there still so much to see 
 Times too much to handle times too much for me 
 It drives me up the walls 
 It drives me out of my mind 
 Can you tell me what this meanshuhIf we could see tomorrow 
 What of your plans 
 No one can live in sorrow 
 Ask all your friends 
 Times that you took in stride 
 Theyre back in demand 
 I was the one whos washing 
 Blood off your hands 
 Dont you cry tonight 
 I still love you baby 
 Theres a heaven above you baby 
 And dont you cry tonight 
 I know the things you wanted 
 Theyre not what you have 
 With all the people talkin 
 Its drivin you mad 
 If I was standin by you 
 How would you feel 
 Knowing your loves decided 
 And all love is real 
 An dont you cry tonight 
 I thought I could live in your world 
 As years all went by 
 With all the voices Ive heard 
 Something has died 
 And when youre in need of someone 
 My heart wont deny you 
 So many seem so lonely 
 With no one left to cry to baby 
 And dont you cry 
 Dont you ever cry 
 Baby maybe someday 
 Dont you cry 
 TonightLove oh ohh

 To when you plead the fifth 
 Thatd be the end of time its true 
 Wouldnt be the first time Ive been wrong 
 Wouldnt be the last I should have known 
 Through all the rumors I can tell 
 Some things didnt work so well 
 Well anyway it feels the same 
 As when you first told me you were gone 
 So long ago but Ive still held on 
 Through all the emotions the love and the sex 
 Thats the truth and heres the worst yet 
 Wouldnt even matter the things that Id say 
 You made your mind up and gone anyway 
 Theres no use now in dragging it on 
 Couldve seen it coming all along 
 Well its true oh 
 I had my doubts with you 
 Gonna call myself a private I 
 Gonna need the IRS 
 Gonna get the FBI 
 Gonna make this a federal case 
 Gonna wave it right down in your face 
 Read it daily with your morning news 
 With a sweet hangover and the headlines too now 
 I bet youre thinking Im doing this all for my health 
 I shouldve looked again then at somebody else 
 Feelin like Ive done way more than wrong 
 Feelin like Im living inside of this song 
 Feelin like Im just too tired to care 
 Feelin like I done more than my share 
 Could it be the way that Ive carried on 
 Like a broken record for so long 
 What can I do 
 Ooh oh

 Gonna need myself the FBI

 You pack your bags 
 And you move to the city 
 Theres somethin missin here at home 
 You fix your hair 
 And youre lookin real pretty 
 Its time to get it out on your own 
 Youre always fightin 
 With your mama and you papa 
 Your family life is one big pain 
 When you you gonna move to the city 
 Into the city where it all began 
 You gotta move You gotta move 
 Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma 
 Time you gotta move 
 You stole your mamas car 
 And your daddys plastic credit card 
 Youre sixteen and you cant get a job 
 Youre not goin very far 
 Youre always ridin 
 With the teachers and the police 
 This life is much too insane 
 Right to the city 
 Where the real men get it 
 Aw child aint it a pity 
 Sometimes it gets too shitty 
 Come on and hit me 
 Youre on the streets 
 And it aint so pretty 
 You need to get a new what you please 
 You do what you gotta do for the money 
 At times you end up on your knees 
 Im always buyin 
 With the local and the junkies 
 This city life is one big pain 
 But you you had to move to the city 
 Oh right to the city 
 With the real nitty gritty 
 Come on and hit meAnd now I dont know why 
 She wouldnt say goodbye 
 But then it seems that I 
 Had seen it in her eyes 
 Though it might not be wise 
 I still have to try 
 With all the love I have inside 
 I cant deny 
 I just cant let it die 
 Cause her hearts just like mine 
 And she holds her pain inside 
 So if you ask me why 
 I know somewhere inside 
 There is a special light 
 Still shining bright 
 And even on the darkest night 
 She cant deny 
 So if shes somewhere near me 
 I hope to God she hears me 
 Theres no one else could ever make me feel Im so alive 
 I hoped shed never leave me 
 Please God you must believe me 
 Ive searched the universe and found myself within her eyes 
 No matter how I try 
 They say its all a lie 
 So whats the use of my 
 Confessions to a crime 
 Of passions that wont die 
 In my heart 
 So now I dont know why 
 It just might be that I 
 And now it seems that I 
 Gave up my ghost of pride 
 Ill never say goodbyeI used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her Mm yeah 
 I had to put her six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complain 
 I used to love her Ooh yeah 
 I knew Id miss her 
 So I had to keep her 
 Shes buried right in my backyard 
 Oh yeah Ooh yeah whoa oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 She bitched so much She drove me nuts 
 And now Im happier this way yeah 
 Whoa oh yeah 
 I had to put her Ooh six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complainIf I say I dont need anyone 
 I can say these things to you 
 Cause I can turn on anyone 
 Just like I turned on you 
 Ive got a tongue like a razor 
 A sweet switchblade knife 
 And I can do you favors 
 But then youll do whatever I like 
 Here I am 
 And youre a Rocket Queen 
 I might be a little young 
 But honey I aint naive 
 And youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah 
 I might be too much 
 But honey youre a bit obscene 
 Ive seen everything imaginable 
 Pass before these eyes 
 Ive had everything thats tangible 
 Honey youd be surprised 
 Im a sexual innuendo 
 In this burned out paradise 
 If you turn me on to anything 
 You better turn me on tonight 
 I see you standing standing on your own 
 Its such a lonely place for you for you to be 
 If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend 
 Ill be here standing until the bitter end 
 No one needs the sorrow 
 No one needs the pain 
 I hate to see you 
 Walking out there out in the rain 
 So dont chastise me 
 Or think I I mean you harm 
 Of those that take you 
 Leave you strung out much too far baby yeah 
 Woah no woah woah baby yeah 
 Dont ever leave me 
 Say youll always be there 
 All I ever wanted 
 Was for you to know that I careGonna find a way to cure this loneliness 
 Yeah Ill find a way to cure the pain 
 If I said that youre my friend 
 And our love would never end 
 How long before I had your trust again 
 I opened up the doors when it was cold outside 
 Hoping that youd find your own way in 
 But how can I protect you 
 Or try not to neglect you 
 When you wont take the love I have to give 
 I bought me an illusion 
 And I put it on the wall 
 I let it fill my head with dreams 
 And I had to have them all 
 But oh the taste is never so sweet 
 As what youd believe it is 
 Well I guess it never is 
 Its these prejudiced illusions 
 That pumps the blood to the heart of the biz 
 You know I never thought that it could take so long 
 You know I never knew how to be strong 
 Yeah I let you shape me 
 But I feel as though you raped me 
 Cause you climbed inside my world and in my songs 
 Now Ive closed the door to keep the cold outside 
 Seems somehow Ive found the will to live 
 But how can I forget you 
 Or try not to reject you 
 When we both know it takes time to forgive yeah 
 Sweetness is a virtue 
 And you lost your virtue long ago 
 You know Id like to hurt you 
 But my conscience always tells me no 
 You could sell your body on the street 
 To anyone whom you might meet 
 Whod love to try and get inside 
 And bust your innocence open wide 
 Cause my babys got a locomotive 
 My babys gone off the track 
 My babys got a locomotive 
 Gotta peel the bitch off my back 
 I know it looks like Im insane 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame no 
 Gonna have some fun with my frustration 
 Gonna watch the big screen in my head 
 Id rather take a detour 
 Cause this road aint getting clearer 
 Your train of thought has cut me off again 
 Better tame that boy cause hes a wild one 
 Better tame that boy fore hes a man 
 Sweetheart dont make me laugh 
 Yous getting too big for your pants 
 And Is think maybe you should cut out while you can 
 You can use you illusion 
 Let it take you where it may 
 We live and learn 
 And then sometimes its best to walk away 
 Me Im just here hanging out in my only place to stay 
 At least for now anyway 
 Ive worked too hard for my illusions 
 Just to throw them all away 
 Im taking time for quiet consolation 
 In passing by this love thats passed away 
 I know its never easy 
 So why should you believe me 
 When Ive always got so many things to say 
 Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made 
 Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged 
 You know I tried to wake you 
 I mean how long could it take you 
 To open up your eyes and turn the page hey 
 Kindness is a treasure 
 And its one towards me youve seldom shown 
 So Ill say it for good measure 
 To all the ones like you Ive known 
 You know Id like to shave your head 
 And all my friends could paint it red 
 Cause love to mes a two way street 
 And all I really want is peace 
 But my babys got a locomotive 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame no 
 Affection is a blessing 
 Can you find it in your sordid heart 
 I tried to keep this thing together 
 But the tremor tore my pad apart 
 Yeah I know its hard to face 
 When all weve worked fors gone to waste 
 But youre such a stupid woman 
 And Im such a stupid man 
 But love like times got its own plans 
 Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
 Take a closer look Im not to blame 
 Yeah 
 If love is blind I guess Ill buy myself a cane 
 Loves so strange 
 Loves so strangeMans got his woman to take his seed 
 Hes got the power  oh 
 Shes got the need 
 She spends her life through pleasing up her man 
 She feeds him dinner or anything she can 
 She cries alone at night too often 
 He smokes and drinks and dont come home at all 
 Only women bleed 
 Man makes your hair gray 
 Hes your lifes mistake 
 All youre really lookin for is an even break 
 He lies right at you 
 You know you hate this game 
 He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain 
 Black eyes all of the time 
 Dont spend a dime 
 Clean up this grime 
 And you there down on your knees begging me please come 
 Watch me bleed 
 Only women bleedKickin back in the shadows 
 Got no need for the light 
 Whos sorry now old timer 
 Look at how youve spent your life 
 Scroungin for change 
 To put some money in your pocket 
 My how scratch does burn 
 Laughin at the suckers as you pissed it away 
 But I got the time and I got the muscle 
 I got the need to lay it all on the line 
 I aint afraid of your smoke screen hustle 
 Its a perfect crime 
 Goddamn it its a perfect crime 
 Motherfucker its a perfect crime 
 I said its perfect 
 Keep the demons down and drag the skeletons out 
 I got a blind man followin me in chains 
 I said hes fun to watch when the world has stopped 
 And I think hes got somethin to say 
 You wanna fuck with me 
 Dont fuck with me 
 Cause Im what youll be 
 So dont fuck with me 
 If you had better sense 
 Youd step aside from the bad side of me 
 Dont fuck with the bad side of me 
 Stay away from the bad side of me 
 Dont fuck with the bad side 
 Tminus 109 and counting 
 Ostracized but thats all right 
 I was thinkin about somethin myself 
 12345678 
 Call on everybody whos got last rites 
 Said its better if you locked em away 
 Runnin through the visions at the speed of light

 Dont ya know ya better let me be 
 Perfect crime

 I dont even understand why the fuck you even care 
 And I dont need your jealousy yeah 
 Why drag me down in your misery 
 And when you stare dont you think I feel it 
 But Im gonna deal it back to you in spades 
 When Im havin fun you know I cant conceal it 
 Cause I know youd never cut it in my game oh no 
 And when youre talkin about a vasectomy yeah 
 Ill be writin down your obituary 
 History 
 You got your bitches with the silicone injections 
 Crystal meth and yeast infections 
 Bleached blond hair collagen lip projections 
 Who are you to criticize my intentions 
 With subtle manipulative devices 
 Just like you I got my vices 
 I got a thought that would be nice 
 Id like to crush your head tight in my vice 
 Pain

 Cause Ill always be in love with you 
 But let her be somebody elses queen 
 I dont want to know about you

 And thats why I got to live without you 
 Im in love with a girl 
 Been talkin about 
 That I cant live without 
 Im in love but it feels like 
 Im livin it out 
 Im in love but I think I picked a Bad Time 
 To be in loveNo I wont 
 You know youre all alone 
 Your friends they arent at home 
 Everybodys gone to the garden 
 As you look into the trees 
 You can look but you dont see 
 Flowers seem to tease you at the garden 
 Everybodys there 
 But you dont seem to care 
 Whats it with you man and this garden yeah 
 Turned into my worst phobia 
 A crazy mans utopia 
 If youre lost no one can show ya 
 But it sure was glad to know ya 
 Only poor boys take a chance 
 On the gardens song and dance 
 Feel her flowers as they wrap around 
 But only smart boys do without 
 You can find it all inside 
 No need to wrestle with your pride 
 No you aint losin your mind 
 Youre just in the garden 
 They can lead you to yourself 
 Or you can throw it on the shelf 
 But you know you can look inside 
 For the garden 
 I wasnt really scared 
 Lost my virginity there 
 To a gypsy with blonde hair 
 But now no one seems to care 
 Like a mouse inside a maze 
 Wandering round for days 
 With a smile upon my face 
 I never wanna leave this place 
 On this gardens song and dance 
 Its a crazy mans utopia 
 If youre lost no one can show ya 
 Bye bye 
 So long bye bye 
 Its glad to know ya 
 Aw so longTalk to me softly 
 There is something in your eyes 
 Dont hang your head in sorrow 
 And please dont cry 
 I know how you feel inside Ive 
 Ive been there before 
 Somethin is changin inside you 
 And dont you know 
 Give me a whisper 
 And give me a sign 
 Give me a kiss before you 
 Tell me goodbye 
 Dont you take it so hard now 
 And please dont take it so bad 
 Ill still be thinkin of you 
 And the times we had baby 
 And please remember that I never lied 
 And please remember 
 How I felt inside now honey 
 You gotta make it your own way 
 But youll be all right now sugar 
 Youll feel better tomorrow 
 Come the morning light now baby

 You know youre crazy 
 Well youre crazy 
 You know youre crazy oh 
 You know you are 
 Bring it down 
 Youre fuckin crazyAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 All the innocence inside 
 You know I tried so hard to make you 
 To make you change your mind 
 And it hurts too much to see you 
 And how you left yourself behind 
 You know I didnt want to meet you 
 Now theres a hell I cant describe 
 So now I wander through my day 
 Trying to find my way 
 Still these feelings that I felt 
 I said to you and no one else 
 And no its not going to change 
 I know its gone still Im used 
 And thats nice to hang on someone 
 A change thats bittersweet 
 Thats called the blues 
 Dont know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 You know its what you planned this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore 
 I dont know just what I should do 
 You know its what we planned this much is true 
 What this means to me 
 The more I know you believe 
 What I thought was you now 
 Has got more that it changed on you 
 What I thought was true 
 The more that I might know is you 
 What I thought was you 
 Is only memories distantDiamonds and fast cars 
 Money to burn 
 I got my head in the clouds 
 I got these thoughts to churn 
 Got my feet in the sand 
 I got a house on the hill 
 I got a headache like a mother 
 Twice the price of my thrills 
 And its a cold day 
 Its a continental drift 
 I said this traffic is hell 
 Can you give me a lift 
 And Ill try to paint a story 
 Got your pictures to tell 
 Yeah you got to make a living 
 With what you bring yourself to sell 
 I got some genuine 
 Imitation bad apples 
 Free sample for your peace of mind 
 Only 995 
 I got my camera back from customs 
 Got my law fees up to date 
 Hell they musta seen me comin 
 Aint this life so fuckin great 
 When the shit hit the fan 
 It was all I could stand yeah 
 Well Im a frequent flyer 
 My bodys breathing while it can 
 But what I dont understand is that 
 My world aint gettin no brighter 
 If I could touch the sky 
 Well I would float on by 
 While everybodys talkin hell Im just another guy 
 If it were up to me 
 Id say just leave me be 
 Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch 
 Gold and caviar 
 Now why dont you pour my apathy 
 And Id have all my bases covered 
 If I could teach my hands to see 
 But now were down in the deep end 
 Where theyd love to watch you drown 
 I said your laundry could use washing 
 Well hang it up all over town 
 I said Hollywoods like a dryer 
 And were down on Sunset Strip 
 And youll be suckin down the Clorox 
 Till your lifes all nice and crisp 
 BoyI get up around seven 
 Get outta bed around nine 
 And I dont worry about nothin no 
 Cause worryins a waste of my time 
 The show usually starts around seven 
 We go on stage around nine 
 Get on the bus about eleven 
 Sippin a drink and feelin fine 
 We been dancin with Mr Brownstone 
 Hes been knockin 
 He wont leave me alone 
 No no no he wont leave me alone 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 Now I get up around whenever 
 I used to get up on time 
 But that old man hes a real motherfucker 
 Gonna kick him on down the line 
 No no no he wont leave me alone never 
 Oh leave me alone 
 Stuck it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle 
 And it it drove me outta my mind 
 I shouldve known better said I wish I never met her 
 Said I I leave it all behind 
 YowsaWe both lie silently still 
 In the dead of the night 
 Although we both lie close together 
 We feel miles apart inside 
 Was it something I said or something I did 
 Did my words not come out right 
 Though I tried not to hurt you 
 Though I tried 
 But I guess thats why they say 
 Every rose has its thorn 
 Just like every night has its dawn 
 Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song 
 Yeah it does 
 I listen to our favorite song 
 Playing on the radio 
 Hear the DJ say loves a game 
 Of easy come and easy go 
 But I wonder does he know 
 Has he ever felt like this 
 And I know youd be here right now 
 If I could have let you know somehow 
 I guess 
 Though its been a while now 
 I can still feel so much pain 
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals 
 But the scar that scar remains 
 I know I could have saved our love that night 
 If Id known what to say 
 Instead of makin love 
 We both made our separate ways 
 But now I hear you found somebody new 
 And that I never meant that much to you 
 To hear that tears me up inside 
 And to see you cuts me like a knife 
 I guessNow if you know anything about us we write most of our sond with based off an eliment of truth but this song is kinda like a fantasy and a joke cause its kind of a sick subject but you know sometimes when your boyfriend or your girlfriend is just a pain in a fuckin ass and you wish you could chop there fuckin head off and stick it in a bag and put it in the back yardThis is called I Used To Love Her But I had To Kill Her 
 And I can still hear her complainWhen youre talkin to yourself 
 And nobodys home 
 You can fool yourself 
 You came in this world alone 
 Alone 
 So nobody ever told you baby 
 How it was gonna be 
 So whatll happen to you baby 
 Guess well have to wait and see 
 One two 
 Old at heart but Im only 28 
 And Im much too young to let love break my heart 
 Young at heart but its getting much too late 
 To find ourselves so far apart 
 I dont know how youre supposed to find me lately 
 And what more could you ask from me 
 How could you say that I never needed you 
 When you took everything 
 Said you took everything from me 
 Young at heart and it gets so hard to wait 
 When no one I know can seem to help me now 
 Old at heart but I mustnt hesitate 
 If Im to find my own way out 
 Still talkin to myself 
 So nobody ever told us baby 
 So whatll happen to us baby 
 When I find out all the reasons 
 Maybe Ill find another way 
 Find another day 
 With all the changing seasons of my life 
 Maybe Ill get it right next time 
 And now that youve been broken down 
 Got your head out of the clouds 
 Youre back down on the ground 
 And you dont talk so loud 
 And you dont walk so proud 
 Anymore and what for 
 Well I jumped into the river 
 Too many times to make it home 
 Im out here on my own 
 And drifting all alone 
 If it doesnt show give it time 
 To read between the lines 
 Cause I see the storm is getting closer 
 And the waves they get so high 
 Seems everything weve ever knowns here 
 Why must it drift away and die 
 Ill never find any light to replace you 
 Guess Ill have to make it through this time 
 Oh this time 
 Without you 
 I knew the storm was getting closer 
 And all my friends said I was high 
 But everything weve ever knowns here 
 I never wanted it to dieIm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth 
 And youre gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out 
 Standin on the corner 
 Callin you names 
 With my juvenile skills and juvenile games 
 Im a fast motherfucker 
 Tell you bout it sucker 
 Fuck with me and Ill fuck your mother 
 Your sister too 
 Your best girlfriend 
 Line em up 
 Put em end to end 
 I stick it in pull it out 
 Then I grab your face 
 And cum in your mouth 
 Said it tastes good dont it 
 Said it tastes good and you know it 
 If youre lookin for trouble 
 Im the one 
 If youre lookin for a fight 
 Then well have some fun 
 Stupid motherfuckers shouldnt have ragged on me 
 They cant see what I can see 
 Ive been up

 Kickin shit all over this town 
 What they say means nothin to me 
 Sweet sweet taste of victory 
 I said it tastes good dont it

 My dog bit me on the leg today

 The Reverend Smedley he recognized me 
 And punched me in the nose 
 He said 
 He said youre sick youre obscene 
 He says youre sick youre obsceneSeems like forever 
 And a day 
 If my intentions 
 Are misunderstood 
 Please be kind 
 Ive done 
 All I should 
 I wont ask 
 Of you 
 What I would 
 Not do 
 Oh I saw the damage in you 
 My fortune had won the ending you 
 Why would they tell me to please dont just laugh in my face 
 When all of the reasons they taugh us fall over themselves 
 To give way 
 Ah yeah 
 Its not a question whether my heart is true 
 Streamed line 
 I had to pull through 
 Look for a new beginning 
 On you 
 Whoa I got a message for you 
 Open a way its what Ive got to do 
 Give what you have for what you might lose 
 What would you say if I told you that Im to blame 
 And what would you do if I had to deny your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away 
 Ooh yeah 
 Who should I tell if not for the ones 
 That you could not save 
 Ooh now 
 I told you when I found you 
 If there was doubts you 
 Should be careful and unafraid 
 Now they surround you 
 All that amounts to 
 Is love that youve crippled for fortune and fame 
 If my affections 
 Are misunderstood 
 And you decide 
 Im up to no good 
 Dont ask me to 
 Enjoy them just for you 
 Ask yourself 
 What I would do 
 To prostitute myself 
 To live with fortune and shame 
 When you should have turned to the hearts of the ones 
 That you would not save 
 I told you 
 When I found you 
 Is love that youve crippled for fortune and fameIm reckless and feelin no pain 
 You know Ive got no need to control 
 Livin with the danger 
 Im always on the edge now 
 With million dollar visions that I hold 
 Livin like this never ever 
 Tore my life apart 
 I know how to maintain 
 And you know I know my part 
 On a holiday a permanent vacation 
 Im living on a cigarette with wine 
 Im never alone cause Ive got myself 
 Yes I imitate myself all of the time 
 Cause its comin from my heart 
 I lead a reckless life 
 And I dont need your advice 
 And you know its my only vice 
 Reckless life 
 And you know its my only 
 Hey hey  yeahI never meant to cause you any sorrow 
 I never meant to cause you any pain 
 I only wanted to one time see you laughing 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain 
 Purple rain Purple rain 
 I never wanted to be your weekend lover 
 I only wanted to be some kind of friend 
 I could never steal you from another 
 Its such a shame our friendship had to end 
 I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain 
 Honey I know I know times are changing 
 Its time we all reach out for something new 
 That means you too 
 You say you want a leader 
 But you cant seem to make up your mind 
 I think you better close it 
 And let me guide you to the purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rainNo one ever told me when I was alone 
 They just thought Id know better better 
 No one ever told me when I was alone 
 The hardest part this troubled heart 
 Has never yet been through now 
 Was heal the scars that got their start 
 Inside someone like you now 
 For had I known or Id been shown 
 Back when how long itd take me 
 To break the charms that brought me harm 
 And all but would erase me 
 I never would or thought I could 
 No matter what youd pay me 
 Replay the part you stole my heart 
 I should have known youre crazy 
 If all I knew was that with you 
 Id want someone to save me 
 Itd be enough but just my luck 
 I fell in love and maybe 
 All that I wanted was 
 Now I know you better 
 You know I know better 
 So bittersweet this tragedy 
 Wont ask for absolution 
 This melody inside of me 
 Still searches for solution 
 A twist of fate a change of heart 
 Cures my infatuation 
 Of a broken heart provides the spark 
 For my determination 
 I never wanted you to be so full of anger 
 I never wanted you to be somebody else 
 I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves 
 I only wanted you to see things for yourself 
 Now we all know better 
 All that I wanted was 
 No no no no

 If I were you Id manage to 
 Avoid the invitation 
 Of promised love that cant keep up

 Youll find your inspiration 
 To choose your steps and wont regret

 Ya like to dance ya like to sing

 Ya wanna danceWe all come in from the cold 
 We come down from the wire 
 And everybody warms themselves 
 To a different fire 
 When sometimes we get burned 
 Youd think sometime wed learn 
 The one you love is the one 
 That should take you higher 
 You aint got no one 
 You better go back out and find her 
 Just like children hidin in a closet 
 Cant tell whats goin on outside 
 Sometimes were so far off the beaten path 
 We get taken for a ride 
 By a parlor trick or some words of wit 
 A hidden hand up a sleeve 
 To think that thee one you love could hurt you now 
 Is a little hard to believe 
 But everybody darlin 
 Sometimes bites the hand that feeds 
 When I look around 
 Everybody always brings me down 
 Well is it them or me 
 Well I just cant see 
 But there aint no peace to found 
 But if someone really cared 
 Well theyd take the time to spare 
 A moment to try and understand 
 Another ones despair 
 Remember in this game we call life 
 That no one said its fair 
 Ooh yeah 
 Breakdown 
 let me hear it now 
 let me hear it now yeah 
 Get down with yo bad self alright 
 Ive come to know the cold 
 I think of it as home 
 When there aint enough of me to go around 
 Id rather be left alone 
 But if I call you out of habit 
 Im out of love and I gotta have it 
 Would you give it to me if I fit you needs 
 Like when we both knew we had it 
 But now the damages done 
 And were back out on the run 
 Funny how everything was roses 
 When we held on to the guns 
 Just because youre winnin 
 Dont mean youre the lucky ones 
 yeah 
 Hay yay 
 There goes the challenger 
 Being chased by the blue blue meanies on wheels 
 The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver 
 The last American hero 
 Thethe electric sintar 
 The demigod 
 The super driver of the golden west 
 Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver 
 The police numbers are getting closercloser 
 Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby 
 They about to strike they gonna get him SMASH  RAPE  
 The last beautiful free soul on this planet 
 But it is written 
 If the Evil Spirit arms the Tiger with claws 
 Brahman provided wings for the Dove 
 Thus spake the Super Guru

 And what you need is a plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint 
 Whos going to sit through all the madness always act so quaint 
 I said  a oh yeah well  a 
 Its your new friend youre really 
 Making a scene and Ive seen you 
 Bouncing around from machine to machine 
 But you know that 
 Theyre never really 
 Never really what they seem and you can count on 
 Generate some warmth then youll 
 See just what I mean oh baby baby baby yeah 
 Then if Im acting like a king dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being and if I 
 Want too many things dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being 
 And if Ive got to dream dont you know its cause 
 Im a human being and well if 
 Its a bit obscene dont you know its cause 
 I dont gotta walk around with my head on down 
 Just like a human oh no a human being 
 I can hold my head so high 
 Just like a human a real proud human being 
 Wont you give me a little sip why wont you give me a 
 Drag of that cigarette why dont you

 Youre trying to cover up a big disgrace 
 Baby yeah yeah yeah 
 Come on come on come on 
 Well I may think that this whole scene is just a 
 Too appalling for me 
 Well I may be the type whos just mad about 
 Every little thing that I see but I can 
 Colour that with history and make it 
 Just what I want it to be well Im 
 Blowing my change on the fan magazines with all the 
 Hollywood refugees oh baby baby oh yeah 
 Im a human beingTake me down to the paradise city 
 Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty 
 Take me home Oh wont you please take me home 
 Take me down to the paradise city 
 Just an urchin livin under the street 
 Im a hard case thats tough to beat 
 Im your charity case so buy me somethin to eat 
 Ill pay you at another time 
 Take it to the end of the line 
 Rags to riches or so they say 
 You gotta keep pushin for the fortune and fame 
 You know its its all a gamble when its just a game 
 You treat it like a capital crime 
 Everybodys doin their time 
 Oh wont you please take me home yeah yeah 
 Take me home 
 Strapped in the chair of the citys gas chamber 
 Why Im here I cant quite remember 
 The surgeon general says its hazardous to breathe 
 Id have another cigarette but I cant see 
 Tell me who ya gonna believe 
 Take me home yeah yeah 
 Oh wont you please take me home yeah 
 So far away 
 Captain Americas been torn apart 
 Now hes a court jester with a broken heart 
 He said Turn me around and take me back to the start 
 I must be losin my mind are you blind

 Oh wont you please take me home 
 Oh wont you please take me home home 
 Oh I want to go I want to know 
 I want to see how good it can be 
 Take me down take me down 
 Oh oh take me home 
 I want to know I want to know 
 Yeah babyWhat weve got here is failure to communicate 
 Some men you just cant reach 
 So you get what we had here last week 
 which is the way he wants it 
 Well he gets it  I dont like it 
 any more than you men 
 Look at your young men fighting 
 Look at your women crying 
 Look at your young men dying 
 The way theyve always done before 
 Look at the hate were breeding 
 Look at the fear were feeding 
 Look at the lives were leading 
 The way weve always done before 
 My hands are tied 
 The billions shift from side to side 
 And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
 For the love of God and our human rights 
 And all these things are swept aside 
 By bloody hands time cant deny 
 And are washed away by your genocide 
 And history hides the lies of our civil war 
 Did you wear a black armband 
 When they shot the man 
 Who said 
 Peace could last forever 
 And in my first memories 
 They shot Kennedy 
 I went numb when I learned to see 
 So I never fell for Vietnam 
 We got the wall of DC to remind us all 
 That you cant trust freedom 
 When its not in your hands 
 When everybodys fightin 
 For their promised land and 
 I dont need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Aint that fresh 
 No no no no no 
 Look at the shoes youre filling 
 Look at the blood were spilling 
 Look at the world were killing 
 Look in the doubt weve wallowed 
 Look at the leaders weve followed 
 Look at the lies weve swallowed 
 And I dont want to hear no more 
 For all Ive seen has changed my mind 
 But still the wars go on as the years go by 
 With no love of God or human rights 
 Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
 By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
 Who carry the cross of homicide 
 And history bears the scars of our civil war 
 We practice selective annihilation 
 Of mayors and government officials 
 for example to create a vacuum 
 Then we fill that vacuum 
 As popular war advances 
 Peace is closer 
 And I dont need your civil war 
 I dont need one more war 
 No no no 
 Whats so civil bout war anywayAll I need is some inspiration 
 But boredom eats me like cancer 
 Drinking lemonade shandy 
 Aint nobody here to do me harm 
 I cant fall in love with a wheatfield 
 Well everything smells like horse shit 
 Baaaaa 
 Hold stillYou better change your attitude 
 Cause you know you want it to 
 You bring me all your pride 
 But I know you hold it too 
 I can feed your bounty yeah 
 If you feed my head as well 
 And I wont give you empty promises yeah 
 When the quarters in the wishing well 
 But this aint no sentimental movie 
 Where dreams collect like dust 
 You talk to me with innocence in your eyes 
 So now who can you trust 
 You think you look so cool 
 Yes you do 
 You take me for your fool yeah 
 Itching for your of the hug 
 Baby I want a new start but dont you be true yeah 
 I can see through your door 
 You put my head into these walls 
 You take my heart to the dockside yeah 
 You put me in the car 
 And take me for another ride 
 Trust 
 Put a path on to your veins 
 And antique and old whores our new pain yeah 
 The tears you cried 
 All the tears you cried tonight 
 You put me down 
 But you cant get out of sight 
 And this aint no sentimental movie 
 You push it on 
 You grab it on 
 But I dont see the TV 
 This aint no sentimental movie 
 Yeah see the screen 
 Youre startin to scream 
 Abusin confusin 
 Your programs over 
 Yeah you look so cool 
 Dont take me for another one of your scenes 
 YeaSeems like forever and a day 
 If my intentions are misunderstood 
 Please be kind Ive done all I should 
 I wont ask of you what I would not do 
 Oh I saw the damage in you 
 My fortunate one 
 The envy of youth 
 Why would they tell me to please those 
 That laugh in my face 
 When all of the reasons theyve taught us 
 Fall over themselves to give way 
 Its not a question whether my heart is true 
 Streamlined I had to pull through 
 Look for a new beginning on you 
 Oh I got a message for you 
 Up and away 
 Its what I gotta do 
 Forgive what you have 
 For what you might lose 
 And what would you do if I had to deny your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you 
 And then walked away 
 N who would I turn to if not for the ones 
 You could not say 
 If there were doubts you 
 And all that amounts to 
 Is love that you fed by 
 Perversion and pain 
 So if my affections are misunderstood 
 And you decide Im up to no good 
 Dont ask me to enjoy them just for you 
 Ask yourself 
 Why I would choose 
 To prostitute myself 
 To live with fortune and shame oh yeah 
 That you could not save 
 Perversion and painIve been lookin for a trace 
 Lookin for a lover in a world 
 Thats much too dark 
 Ooh yeah 
 Youve got to find yourself 
 Another piece of the action yeah 
 Ive been lookin everywhere 
 Ive been lookin for you 
 Ive got your satisfaction 
 Another piece of the action 
 Cause your crazy 
 Crazy 
 Youre fuckin crazy 
 Oh my 
 Oh child 
 I said youre crazy 
 Say boy where ya coming from 
 Whered you get that point of view 
 Said I knew someone like you and they said 
 Yeah 
 Youve gotta find yourself 
 Cause youre crazy 
 Ooh youre crazy 
 Ooh yeah youre crazy 
 Youre fuckin crazyIt was long ago 
 Seems like a dream 
 The day I sucked the air 
 From a bottle of whipped cream 
 And I got real high 
 And things got real slow 
 And I started talking like this 
 Whats going on 
 I dont know 
 And then I sold my car 
 For a Greatful Dead ticket 
 My dad yelled at me 
 And he grounded me 
 And he said I was a dick 
 It was the worst day of my life 
 And Ill never forget 
 But the very next day 
 I was doing bong hits 
 In the back of my friends chevy 
 So dont tell me 
 Were winning the war on drugs 
 Cause drugs are like a big ol can of raid 
 And youre all little bugs 
 And dont tell me 
 To not get high 
 Cause Im as low as I can get 
 Without kissing your ass 
 And blowing you at the same time 
 Man dont tell me about love and peace 
 When one of the Joneses have a handgun 
 Pointed at me 
 Dont tell me to just say no 
 Im an addict I say dont let me go 
 Whatever happened to sex drugs n rock n roll 
 Now we just have AIDS crack and techno 
 So they busted me 
 So I say fuck them up 
 For selling dope 
 And I went to jail 
 And I wasnt forgiven 
 Like that little fucker who shot the pope 
 And he said I had the right to remain silent 
 And they couldnt explain 
 But I didnt resist 
 And I was invited 
 Cause all I ever wanted was the right to remain 
 And they questioned me 
 Yeah they asked me why 
 And I said fuck off 
 I dont think I should be shot 
 For selling pot 
 Its just my little way of saying high 
 Now my records all fucked up 
 Now two times a week 
 They make me piss in a cup 
 Well what I want to do 
 Is piss down their throats 
 Okay heres the sensitive part 
 They told me 
 That times have changed 
 Cause our parents had 
 Hendrix Janice and Jim 
 But what about 
 River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain 
 And they told me 
 To praise the lord 
 But Ive been waiting for so long 
 For him to call me back 
 I think Im gonna go pray 
 At Betty Ford 
 That life was fair 
 I cant smoke a plant that was made by God 
 But I can kill my wife if Im a football player 
 And they told me 
 They told me to just ignore 
 But Id rather smoke crack 
 Outta Nancy Reagans skull 
 While gettin a blowjob

 And I howled at my ma in the driving rain 
 But its all right now in fact its a gas 
 But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash 
 Its a Gas Gas Gas 
 I was raised by a toothless bearded hag 
 I was schooled with a strap right across my back 
 But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash 
 I was drowned I was washed up and left for dead 
 I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled 
 I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 I was crowned with a spike right through my head 
 Jumping Jack Flash its a gas 
 Jumping Jack FlashIt dont really matter 
 You will find out for yourself 
 No it dont really matter 
 Youre gonna leave this thing to somebody else 
 If they where missionaires 
 Real time visionaires 
 Sitting in a Chinese stew 
 To view my disinfatuation 
 I know that Im a classic case 
 Watch my disenchanted face 
 Blame it on the Falun Gong 
 Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on 
 Cause it would take a lot more hate than you 
 To stop the fascination 
 Bigger than an iron fist 
 Our baby got to rule the nation 
 But all I got is precious time 
 It dont really matter 
 Youre gonna find out for yourself 
 So you can hear now from 
 Somebody else 
 Cause it would take a lot more time than you 
 Ive got more masturbation 
 Even with your iron fist 
 More than you got to rule the nation 
 What I got is precious time 
 Gonna keep it to myself 
 No it dont really matter 
 So you can hear it now from 
 You think you got it all locked up inside 
 And if you beat them all up theyll die 
 Been like a walk in the park for myself 
 And now youre keepin your own kind in hell 
 And if your Great Wall rocks blame yourself 
 While they all reach out for your help 
 And Im outta timeRollin 
 1 2 3 1 2 3 
 I tried so hard just to get through to you 
 But your heads so far from the realness of truth 
 Was it just a come on in the dark 
 Wasnt meant to last long 
 I think youve worn your welcome honey 
 Ill just see you along 
 As I sing you this song 
 Time can pass slowly things always change 
 You days been numbered and Ive read your last page 
 You was just a temporary lover honey 
 You aint the first 
 Lots of others came before you woman 
 Said but you been the worst 
 Said you been the worst 
 So goodbye to you girl 
 So long farewell 
 I cant hear you cryin 
 Your jivins been hell 
 So look for me walkin 
 Down your street at night 
 Ill be in with another 
 Deep down inside 
 To the bar That was a takeI try and feel the sunshine 
 You bring the rain 
 You try and hold me down 
 With your complaints 
 You cry and moan and complain 
 You whine an tear 
 Up to my neck in sorrow 
 The touch you bring 
 You just dont step inside to 
 To 14 years 
 So hard to keep my own head 
 Thats what I say and you know 
 Ive been the beggar 
 Ive played the thief 
 I was the dog 
 They all tried to beat 
 But its been 14 years of silence 
 Its been 14 years of pain 
 Its been 14 years that are gone forever 
 And Ill never have again well 
 Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
 That Im to blame 
 Well theyre all usedup hasbeens 
 Out of the game 
 This time Ill have the last word 
 You hear what I say 
 I tried to see it your way 
 It wont work today 
 14 years 
 Thats what I say you know 
 Ive been the dealer 
 Hangin on your street 
 Bullshit and contemplation 
 Gossips their trade 
 If they knew half the real truth 
 What would they say 
 Well Im past the point of concern 
 Its time to play 
 These last four years of madness 
 Sure put me straight 
 Dont get back 14 years 
 In just one day 
 Just go away you know 
 Just like a hooker she said 
 Nothin for free 
 Oh I tried to see it your way 
 I tried to see it your wayOoh yeah 
 Ooh yeah 
 How could she look so fine 
 How could it be she might be mine 
 How could she be so cool 
 Ive been taken for a fool 
 So many times yeah 
 Its a story of a man 
 Works as hard as he can 
 Just to be a man who stands on his own 
 But the book always burns 
 As the story takes its turn 
 And leaves a broken man 
 How could she be so fine 
 I owe a favor to a friend 
 My friends they always come through for me yeah 
 As the story takes it turn 
 If you could only live my life 
 You could see the difference you make to me 
 To me 
 Id look right up at night 
 And all Id see was darkness 
 Now I see the stars alright 
 I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
 When the lights went down in your house 
 Yeah that made me happy 
 The sweat I make for you 
 Yeah I think you know where that comes from 
 Guitar come on 
 Yeah well Id look right up at night 
 I think you know where that comes from 
 How could she look so good 
 So good 
 YeahI dont have plans and schemes 
 And I dont have hopes and dreams 
 I I I dont have anything 
 Since I dont have you 
 And I dont have fond desires 
 And I dont have happy hours 
 I dont have anything 
 Happiness and I guess 
 I never will again 
 When you walked out on me 
 In walked old misery 
 And shes been here since then 
 Spoken Yeah were fucked 
 I dont have love to share 
 And I dont have one who cares 
 You you you oh oh 
 You you you oh yeahYeah 
 Attitude 
 Some fucking attitude 
 I cant believe what you say to me 
 You got some attitude 
 Inside that fetal brain 
 Theres got to be a whore 
 If you dont shut your mouth 
 Youre going to feel the floor yeah 
 Attitude what youve got 
 Attitude is what youve got 
 Yeah all right 
 Youre going to feel the motherfucking guitar 
 Oh attitude Attitude 
 Some fucking attitude Attitude 
 Oh attitude 
 Yeah 
 YeahBeen hidin out and layin low 
 Its nothing new to me 
 Well you can always find a place to go 
 If you can keep your sanity 
 They break down the doors and they rape my rights but 
 They wont touch me 
 They scream and yell and fight all night 
 You cant tell me 
 I lose my head I close my eyes 
 Cause I got somethin ve been buildin up inside 
 For so fuckin long 
 Theyre out ta get me 
 They wont catch me 
 Im fuckin innocent 
 They wont break me 
 Sometimes its easy to forget where youre goin 
 Sometimes its harder to leave 
 And evrytime you think you know just what youre doin 
 Thats when your troubles exceed 
 They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but 
 They preach and yell and fight all night 
 Cause I got somethin Ive been buildin up inside 
 Im already gone 
 Cause Im innocent 
 No no 
 Oh no no no no no no 
 No oh no no no 
 Let me see you try 
 Some people got a chip on their shoulder 
 And some would say it was me 
 But I didnt buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me 
 So Id be quick to disagree 
 So you can suck me 
 Take that one to heartBroken glass and cigarettes 
 Writing on the wall 
 It was a bargain for the summer 
 And I thought I had it all 
 I was the one who gave you everything 
 The one who took the fall 
 You were the one who would do anything 
 One who cant recall 
 Where she was while she was sleeping 
 In anothers womens bed 
 Or the doctors or the lawyers 
 Or the stranger that she met 
 If theres nothing that I can gain from this 
 Or anything at all 
 Itd be the knowledge that you gave me 
 When I thought Id heard it all 
 It was a long time for you 
 It was a long time for me 
 Itd be a long time for anyone 
 But looks like its meant to be 
 Social class and registers 
 Cocaine in the hall 
 All the way from California 
 On the way to your next call 
 To those nonnegotiations 
 To simulate a call 
 For the betterment of evils 
 And your ways around the laws 
 Thatd keep you up and sitting pretty 
 On a pedestal or bed 
 And now youre sleeping like an angel 
 Near the man who you gave head 
 If theres something I can make of this 
 Itd be the devil hates a loser 
 And you thought you had it all 
 It was the wrong time for you 
 It was the wrong time for me 
 It was the wrong time for everyone 
 But it looks like Im bout to see for myself 
 If I could go back in time to the place in my soul 
 There all alone 
 Lonely teardrops ooh are calling you 
 But I dont want to know it now 
 Cause knowing you it wont change a damn thing 
 But there was a time 
 Yeah there was a time 
 Didnt want to know it all 
 And I dont wanna know it now 
 I would do anything for you 
 There was a time 
 I would do anything for you ooh 
 I was there for you 
 And I dont wanna know it nowOn the road for forty days 
 Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze 
 Sweet sweet Connie  doin her act 
 She had the whole show and thats a natural fact 
 Up all night with Freddy King 
 I got to tell you pokers his thing 
 Abooze n ladies keep me right 
 As long as we can make it to the show tonight 
 Were an American band 
 Were coming to your town well help you party it down 
 Four young chaquitas in Omaha 
 Was waitin for the band to return from the show 
 Feelin good feelin right its Saturday night 
 The hotel detective  he was outasight 
 Now these fine ladies they had a plan 
 They was out to meet the boys in the band 
 They said Come on dudes lets get it on 
 And we proceeded to tear that hotel down 
 Were an American Band Oohooh 
 Were an American Band OohoohAh when all is said and done 
 Were not the only ones 
 Who look at life this way 
 Thats what the old folks say 
 But every time I see them 
 Makes me wish I had a gun 
 If I thought that I was crazy 
 Well I guess Id have more fun 
 Guess Id have more fun 
 Oooh the catcher in the rye again 
 Wont let you get away from him 
 Tomorrow never comes 
 Its just another day like today 
 You decide cause I dont have to 
 And then theyll find and I wont ask you 
 At anytime or long hereafter 
 If the cold outsides as Im imagining it to be oh 
 La na na na na na na 
 Ooh wont let you get away from him 
 When all is said and done 
 Thats what the young folks say 
 As if theyd ever change 
 As that who lie to say 
 Cause what used to bes not there for me 
 And ought to for someone 
 That belongs insane like I do 
 Lana nana na na na 
 Lana nana na nana 
 On an ordinary day 
 Not in an ordinary way 
 All at once the song I heard 
 No longer would it play 
 For anybody 
 Or anyone 
 That needed comfort from somebody 
 Needed comfort from someone 
 Who cared 
 To be 
 Not like you 
 And unlike me 
 And then the voices went away 
 From me 
 Somehow you set the wheels in motion 
 That haunt our memories 
 You were the instrument 
 You were the one 
 How a body took a body 
 You gave that boy a gun 
 You took our innocence 
 Behind our stares 
 Sometime the only thing 
 We counted on when no one else was there 
 Ah ah ah ah 
 Na na na na na naFound a head and an arm in the garbage can 
 Dont know why Im here 
 Livin on the run for oh so long 
 I gotta go collect 
 Double talkin jive 
 Get the money motherfucker 
 Cause I got no more patience 
 Double talkin lies 
 I got no more patience man 
 Back in town ana all new friends 
 They sayin how ya been 
 Fucked up and outta place 
 Thats how I felt back then 
 You dig what Im sayinHey you caught me in a coma 
 I dont think I wanna 
 Ever come back to this world again 
 Kinda like it in a coma 
 Cause no ones ever gonna 
 Oh make me come back to this world again 
 Now I feel as if Im floating away 
 I cant feel all the pressure and I like it this way 
 But my bodys callin 
 My bodys callin 
 Wont you come back to this world again 
 Suspended deep in a sea of black 
 Ive got the light at the end 
 Ive got the bones on the mast 
 Well Ive gone sailin 
 Ive gone sailin 
 I could leave so easily 
 While friends are calling back to me 
 I said theyre theyre leaving it all up to me 
 When all I needed was clarity and 
 Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on 
 Goddamn it 
 Slippin farther an farther away 
 Its a miracle how long we can stay 
 In a world our minds created 
 In a world thats full of shit 
 Help me 
 Bastard 
 Please understand me 
 Im climbing through the wreckage 
 Of all my twisted dreams 
 But this cheap investigation just 
 Cant stifle all my screams 
 And Im waitin at the crossroads 
 Waiting for you 
 Where are you 
 No ones gonna bother me anymore 
 No ones gonna mess with my head no more 
 I cant understand what all the fightins for 
 But its so nice here down off the shore 
 I wish you could see this cause theres nothing to see 
 Its peaceful here and its fine with me 
 Not like the world where I used to live 
 I never really wanted to live 
 Ahh 
 Okay were starting to lose this guy 
 Zap him again 
 Zap the son of a bitch again 
 Live your life like its a coma 
 Wont you tell me why wed wanna 
 With all the reasons you give its 
 Its kinda hard to believe 
 But who am I to tell you 
 That Ive seen any reason why you should stay 
 Maybe wed be better off without you anyway 
 Got a one way ticket on your last chance ride 
 Gotta one way ticket to your suicide 
 Gotta one way ticket and theres no way out alive 
 And all this crass communication 
 That has left you in the cold 
 Isnt much for consolation 
 When you feel so weak and old 
 But if home is where the heart is 
 Then theres stories to be told 
 No you dont need a doctor 
 No one else can heal your soul 
 Got your mind in submission 
 Got your life on the line 
 But nobody pulled the trigger 
 They just stepped aside 
 They be down by the water 
 While you watch em waving goodbye 
 They be callin in the morning 
 They be hangin on the phone 
 They be waiting for an answer 
 But you know nobodys home 
 And when the bell stopped ringing 
 It was nobodys fault but your own 
 There were always ample warnings 
 There were always subtle signs 
 And you would have seen it comin 
 But we gave you too much time 
 And when you said that no ones listening 
 Whyd your best friend drop a dime 
 Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
 For a way to spend our time 
 And its so easy to be social 
 Its so easy to be cool 
 Yeah its easy to be hungry 
 When you aint got shit to lose 
 And I wish that I could help you 
 With what you hope to find 
 But Im still out here waiting 
 Watching reruns of my life 
 When you reach the point of breaking 
 Know its gonna take some time 
 To heal the broken memories 
 That another man would need just to surviveI wont be told anymore 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm ooh 
 And left so far out from the shore 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore 
 Oh no I wont be told anymore 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm 
 Ooh and left so far out from the shore 
 Oh that I cant find my way back my way anymore 
 No I I I 
 Forgive them that tear down my soul 
 Bless them that they might grow old 
 Oh and free them so that they may know 
 That its never too late 
 For the many times what seemed like a memory 
 I searched and found the way you used to lure me in 
 Oh I found the ways to know why I had to be 
 Mired in denial and so afraid oh 
 If we ever find this true 
 That we have the strength to choose 
 Oh the freedom or the chains 
 We held together 
 Im gonna tell you a story 
 stand up for righteousness 
 what 
 stand up for justice 
 stand up for truth 
 How can a person grow up with all this around them 
 You gotta call on that something 
 where does it come from 
 that can make a way out of no way 
 All this hatred 
 what weve got here is 
 fear 
 that power that can make a way out of no way 
 failure to communicate 
 I tell ya Ive seen the lightning flash Ive heard the thunder roll 
 Everybodys acting like we can do anything and it dont matter what we do 
 Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than we even know 
 Sometimes 
 Hatred isnt something youre born with 
 I feel discouraged 
 It gets taught 
 Sometimes I feel discouraged 
 I felt this fear 
 He promised never to leave me 
 Never to leave me alone 
 No never alone No never alone 
 Lets get something straight alright 
 This whole thing was fucked up 
 never to leave me alone 
 All men betray All lose heart 
 I dont want to lose heartI want to believe 
 black men and white men together at the table of brotherhood I have a dream 
 Free at last free at last Thank the lord all mighty we are free at last 
 Oh I wont be told anymore If we ever find this true 
 That Ive been brought down in this storm That we have the strength to choose 
 And left so far out from the shore Oh the freedom or the chains 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore We held together 
 Oh no I wont be told anymore If we ever find this true 
 That I cant find my way back my way anymore We held togetherLets drink to the hard working people 
 Lets drink to the lowly of birth 
 Raise your glass to the good and the evil 
 Lets drink to the salt of the earth 
 Say a prayer for the common foot soldier 
 Spare a thought for his back breaking work 
 Say a prayer for his wife and his children 
 Who burn the fires and who still till the earth 
 And when I search a faceless crowd 
 A swirling mass of gray and black and white 
 They dont look real to me 
 In fact they look so strange 
 Raise your glass to the hard working people 
 Lets drink to the uncounted heads 
 Lets think of the wandering millions 
 Who need leaders but get gamblers instead 
 Spare a thought for the stay at home voter 
 His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows 
 And a parade of the gray suited grafters 
 A choice of cancer or polio 
 Lets drink to the hard working people 
 Lets think of the lowly of birth 
 Spare a thought for the rag taggy people 
 Sets drink to the salt of the earth 
 Lets think of the two thousand million 
 Lets think of the humble of birthThis ones for you Johnny 
 It doesnt pay to try 
 All the smart boys know why 
 It doesnt mean I didnt try 
 I just never know why 
 It isnt cause Im all alone 
 Oh baby youre not home 
 And when Im home 
 Big deal Im still alone 
 Its so restless as I am 
 Beat my head against a pole 
 Try to knock some sense down side my bones 
 And even though I dont show 
 Those guys are so old 
 Cant put your arms around a memory 
 Dont try 
 Youre just a bastard kid 
 And you got no name 
 Could you live with me 
 Go on and say 
 And even though it dont show 
 Johnny youre me 
 Yeah your memory 
 I want to put my arms around your memory 
 I cant try 
 I cant try 
 Come on 
 LAMF 
 Like a motherfucker 
 Yo Johnny 
 What color were her eyes 
 Oh she was wearing shades 
 Fuck itYesterday 
 There was so many things I was never told 
 Now that Im startin to learn 
 I feel Im growing old 
 Cause yesterdays got nothin for me 
 Old pictures that Ill always see 
 Time just fades the pages 
 In my book of memories 
 Prayers in my pocket 
 And no hand in destiny 
 Ill keep on movin along 
 With no time to plant my feet 
 Some things could be better 
 If wed all just let them be 
 Yesterdays got nothin for me 
 Got nothin for me 
 Yesterday 
 There was so many things I was never shown 
 Suddenly this time I found 
 Im on the streets and Im all alone 
 I aint got time 
 To reminisce old novelties 
 YesterdayIf the world would end today 
 And all the dreams weve had would all just drift away ooh 
 You know theres nothing more to say 
 If the world would end and our love slip away ooh 
 I never knew the way that you look at me 
 Would ever mean so much to me 
 But in my heart I found the feelins that Ive never shown 
 And now theyve got the best of me 
 If the world would end today 
 Oooh 
 La la da da la da da da da da 
 I never thought all the love I was lookin for 
 Could ever be so close to me 
 But youre the only one I have ever loved that has ever loved me 
 And now youve got the best of me 
 And all the dreams we had would all just slip away ooh 
 And all the dreams we had would all just drift away ooh 
 If the world would end and our love slipped away 
 If the world would end and our love slipped awayMy heart is full of love for you

 Riad N The Bedouins 
 Had a plan and thought theyd win 
 But I dont give a fuck bout them 
 Cause I am crazy 
 Oh my salvation 
 All my frustrations 
 Caught in the lies no one had wove as well 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell ooh 
 Say thats a war that you cant win 
 But I have had enough of them 
 And who can blame me 
 Sent down on desert winds 
 Nomads and barbarians 
 I wont bend my will to them 
 You aggravate me 
 And all my frustrations 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell oh 
 Ah ah 
 Had a plan and though theyd win 
 Crossed the line and lost againWanna tell you a story 
 Bout a woman I know 
 When it comes to lovin 
 Oh she steals the show 
 She aint exactly pretty 
 Aint exactly small 
 Fortytwo thirtynine fiftysix 
 You could say shes got it all 
 Never had a woman 
 Never had a woman like you 
 Doing all the things 
 Doing all the things you do 
 Aint no fairy story 
 Aint no skin and bone 
 But you give it all you got 
 Weighing in at nineteen stone 
 Youre a whole lotta woman 
 A whole lotta woman 
 Whole lotta Rosie 
 And youre a whole lotta woman 
 Oh honey you can do it 
 Do it to me all night long 
 Only one to turn 
 Only one to turn me on 
 All through the night time 
 And right around the clock 
 To my surprise 
 Rosie never stopsI know youve been dreaming bout the times in our lives 
 But Ive been screaming in my bed late at night 
 A space a little little and your stack of pain 
 Makes it grip that skull to me child that youll stay 
 Youve been in my life so long can I get through to you 
 I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
 Theres something I need to say before its to late 
 But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay 
 Just another Sunday 
 Oh yaaa just another Sunday 
 Just another Sunday oh yaaa 
 Theres too many games in a day for a simple man to face 
 That desperate moment in your life where you cant be afraid 
 Dont think your second chance will break around the bend 
 Cause hearts dont always share love or the person on the other 
 End 
 But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay ya 
 Just another Sunday yaa 
 Just another Sunday oh baby 
 Its only one more Sunday 
 Those are tickets for the same plane bring it back to me 
 Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery 
 Take a walk away wont end the carousel 
 But if walking away can bring you back then I wish you well

 And Ill leave you lying on the bed 
 Ill be out the door before you wake 
 Its nothing new to you 
 Cause I think weve seen that movie too 
 Cause you could be mine 
 But youre way out of line 
 With your bitch slap rapping 
 And your cocaine tongue 
 You get nothing done 
 I said you could be mine 
 Now holidays come and then they go 
 Its nothing new today 
 Collect another memory 
 When I come home late at night 
 Dont ask me where Ive been 
 Just count your stars Im home again 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine mine mine mine 
 Youve gone sketching too many times 
 Ooh why dont you give it a rest 
 Why must you find 
 Another reason to cry 
 While youre breaking down my back and Ive been racking out my brain 
 It dont matter how we make it cause it always ends the same 
 You can push it for more mileage but your flaps are wearing thin 
 And I could sleep on it till morning but this nightmare never ends 
 Dont forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands 
 And you can take the pity so far but its more than I can stand 
 Cause this couch trips getting older tell me how long has it been 
 Cause five years is forever and you havent grown up yet 
 I said you could be 
 You should be 
 Oh you could be mine 
 YeahYour daddy works in porno 
 Now that mommys not around 
 She used to love her heroin 
 But now shes underground 
 So you stay out late at night 
 And you do your coke for free 
 Drivin your friends crazy 
 With your lifes insanity 
 Well well well you just cant tell 
 Well well well my Michelle 
 Look out 
 Sowin all your wild oats 
 In anothers luxuries 
 Yesterday was Tuesday 
 Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
 But school starts much too early 
 And this hotel wasnt free 
 So party till your connection calls 
 Honey Ill return the key 
 Well well well you never can tell 
 Everyone needs love 
 You know that its true 
 Someday youll find someone 
 Thatll fall in love with you 
 But oh the time it takes 
 When youre all alone 
 That you can call your own 
 But till then you better 
 Now youre clean and so discreet 
 I wont say a word 
 But most of all this song is true 
 Case you havent heard 
 So cmon and stop your cryin 
 We both know money burns 
 Honey dont stop tryin 
 And youll get what you deserve 
 My my my Michelle 
 Ooh my my my Michelle 
 My my my my my my my my Michelle

 And losin touch with all thats real 
 Whole lotta lover keepin undercover 
 Never knowin where you beenOoh yeah 
 Youve been fadin always out paradin 
 Keep in touch with mama kin 
 You always got your tail on the wag 
 Spittin fire from your mouth 
 Just like a dragon 
 You act like a perpetual drag 
 You better check it out 
 Cause someday soon 
 Youll have to climb back on the wagon 
 It aint easy livin like you wanna 
 Its so hard to find piece of mind 
 Yes it is 
 The way I see it 
 You got to say shit 
 But dont forget to drop me a line 
 Bald as an egg at eighteen 
 And workin for daddys such a drag 
 You still stuff your mouth 
 With his beans 
 You better check it out or someday soon 
 Keep in touch with mama kin 
 Tell her where you gone and been 
 Livin out your fantasy 
 Sleepin late and smokin tea 
 Sleepin late and suckin me oh no 
 And workin for daddys just a drag 
 Sleepin late and suckin me 
 Oh ow ow ow yeah owIt dont really matter 
 Youre gonna leave this thing to somebody else 
 If they were missionaries 
 Real time visionaries 
 Sittin in a Chinese stew 
 To view my disinfatuation 
 Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on now 
 Cause it would take a lot more hate than you 
 To end the fascination 
 Even with an iron fist 
 But all I got is precious time 
 Guess Ill keep it to myself 
 Said it dont really matter 
 Each time Ill cry for somebody else 
 Cause it would take a lot more time than you 
 Have got for masturbation 
 But all we got is precious time 
 More than you got to fool a nation 
 Ill guess youll find out for yourself 
 So you can hear it now from somebody else 
 And if you beat em enough theyll die 
 Its like a walk in the park to the cells 
 And now youre keeping your own kind in hell 
 And when your great wall rots blame yourself 
 And youre out of timeTheres a time for a living 
 Time keeps on flying 
 Think youre loving baby 
 But all youre doing is crying 
 Can you feel 
 Are those feelings real 
 Look at your game girl 
 What a mad delusion 
 Living in that confusion 
 Frustration and doubt 
 Can you ever live without the game 
 The sad sad game 
 Mad game 
 Just to say loves not enough 
 Even it cant be true 
 Oh you can tell those lies baby but youre only fooling you 
 Go on look at your game girl 
 And if you cant feel 
 And those feelings aint real 
 Then you better stop tryin 
 Or your gonna play cryin 
 Stop tryin 
 Thats the game 
 Sad sad game 
 Sad game

 Thanks Charles 
 JackAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 Oh to make you change your mind 
 You know I wouldnt want to be you 
 So now I wander through my days 
 And try to find my ways 
 To the feelings that I felt 
 I saved for you and no one else 
 And though as long as this road seems 
 I know its called the street of dreams 
 But thats not stardust on my feet 
 It leaves a taste thats bittersweet 
 Though its what you planned this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore 
 You know its what you planned this much is true oh oh 
 What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore oh oh ah 
 Is more than I know you believe 
 What I thought of you now 
 Has cost more that it should for me 
 What I thought was true before 
 Were lies I couldnt see 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Is only memories 
 Oh oh oh whatd I tell you 
 Oh oh oh thats what I tell you 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh inside of youTell everybody that I am sorry truly sorry 
 For all the wrong Ive done 
 I never meant to hurt nobody no no 
 Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 And I have lied and I have begged and I have cheated 
 And I know my ship it wont be coming in 
 And as I lay me down to take my rest 
 I can see that its just dust in the wind 
 Take hold my hand and hold it tighter ever tighter 
 You must believe that I love you still 
 But my strength it grows weaker and weaker 
 And my body has lost its will 
 Cause I have lied and I have begged and I have cheated 
 Oh Lord I have lost once again 
 And theres no one to help me find my way home 
 Lord and I Lord I never want to hurt nobody 
 And I Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 I can see that its just dust in the windListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 Thrown down in the gutter its more than you deserve 
 Kneeling fucking virgin you know thats what you are 
 Pussy for a maggot isnt that a shock 
 What can I do With a bitch like you 
 All I have I ask of you 
 Ill be dammed 
 If its not true 
 A bitch like you 
 Get your head down in the sky 
 Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart 
 Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are 
 Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart 
 A bitch like youSick of this life 
 Not that youd care 
 Im not the only one with 
 Whom these feelings I share 
 Nobody understands 
 Quite why were here 
 Were searchin for answers 
 That never appear 
 But maybe if I looked real hard Id 
 Id see your tryin too 
 To understand this life 
 That were all goin through 
 Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car 
 I didnt know what to do 
 Woah 
 Sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse 
 And I dont know why youd be bringin me down 
 Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more 
 It may sound funny but youd think by now 
 Id be smilin 
 I guess some things never change ooh 
 Never change 
 I met an old cowboy 
 I saw the look in his eyes 
 Somethin tells me hes been here before 
 Cause experience makes you wise 
 I was only a small child 
 When the thought first came to me 
 That Im a son of a gun and the gun of a son 
 That brought back the devil in me 
 Ooh sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse 
 I guess some things never change 
 I aint quite what youd call an old soul 
 Still wet behind the ears 
 I been around this track a couple of times 
 But now the dust is startin to clear oh yeah 
 I dont know why youd be bringin me down 
 Ooh yeah Id be smilin 
 No way Id be smilin 
 Ooh smilin 
 Sick of this life 
 Whom these feelings I shareTold you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but theyll never find 
 That its all right yes its all right 
 Where to go Where to see 
 Its always been that way and it can never be 
 But its all right yes its all right 
 Give it all and ask for no return 
 And very soon youll see and youll begin to learn 
 Dont you know that its so good for you 
 You can be making love and see it all go through 
 But its all right cause it all right 
 So I told you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but theyll never find it 
 Its all right cause its all rightListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 A bitch like youMy child arrived just the other day 
 Came to the world in the usual way 
 But there were planes to catch and bills to pay 
 He learned to walk while I was away 
 He was talkin fore I knew it 
 And as he grew he said 
 Im gonna be like you Dad 
 You know Im gonna be like you 
 And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon 
 When you comin home 
 Son I dont know when but well get together then 
 You know well have a good time then 
 My son turned ten just the other day 
 He said Thanks for the ball Dad Come on lets play 
 Can you teach me to throw 
 I said Not today I got a lot to do 
 He said Thats okay 
 And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said 
 You know Im gonna be like him yeah 
 You know Im gonna be like him 
 Well he came from college just the other day 
 So much like a man I just had to say 
 Son Im proud of you Can you sit for a while 
 He shook his head and he said with a smile 
 What Id really like Dad is to borrow the car keys 
 See you later Can I have them please 
 Ive long since retired my sons moved away 
 I called him up just the other day 
 I said Id like to see you if you dont mind 
 He said Id love to Dad if I could find the time 
 You see my new jobs a hassle and the kids have the flu 
 But its sure nice talkin to you Dad 
 Its been sure nice talkin to you 
 And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me 
 Hed grown up just like me 
 My boy was just like meAll the love in the world couldnt save you 
 Or the innocence inside 
 You know I wouldnt wanna be you 
 So now I wander through my daze 
 Trying to find my ways 
 Although its what we planned 
 This much is true 
 Dont live inside of you anymore 
 Has cost more than it should for me 
 Was only memoriesWell since my baby left me 
 I found a new place to dwell 
 Its down at the end of lonely street 
 At Heartbreak Hotel 
 You make me so lonely baby 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely I could die 
 And although its always crowded 
 You still can find some room 
 Where broken hearted lovers 
 Do cry away their gloom 
 Well the Bell hops tears keep flowin 
 And the desk clerks dressed in black 
 Well they been so long on lonely street 
 They aint ever gonna look back 
 Hey now if your baby leaves you 
 And you got a tale to tell 
 Just take a walk down lonely street 
 To Heartbreak HotelIts not how youre thinking 
 Or as youve imagined 
 Youve been living in the shade of 
 Beliefs that were fashioned 
 To keep you in slavery and drain out your soul 
 But what can I do when theres so many liars 
 That crawl through your veins 
 Like millions of spiders 
 That seek out their victims 
 And ruin the wiser 
 Watch out 
 Gotcha 
 Oh my god 
 I cant deny this 
 Ive been taught just to kill and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
 Like nobody wanted to know 
 So give it away 
 Like theyre not gonna fuck you 
 How long can you bear him 
 To come back and haunt you 
 To burn past your feelings 
 And cause you to suffer 
 Youre starting to bleed 
 They dont give you up 
 Before its too late 
 What will you offer 
 In way of a healing 
 Im so confused abused misused 
 Like nobody wouldnt know 
 Ooh if it opens your eyes 
 This is better than a strong compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
 If only you had let me know 
 This is better than the last compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shadows 
 And they wont give in 
 Cause they know what theyre after 
 A kick in the face 
 Like its all that would matter 
 Oh 
 Ive been taught just to murder and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
 Cause nobody wouldnt know 
 This is better than a good compromise 
 Ooh well its on with the show 
 Like the tide down on the ocean 
 The waves already set in motion 
 The only one in the game thats lost is you
