It's midnight, the clock strikes twelve 
 When the beasts come out and play 
 The headlines made it clear 
 Judgement day is near 
 They're crawling down the street 
 Sinking their razor teeth 
 They're knocking on every door 
 Now the steel begins to glow 
 They're vapourizing the earth, no mercy 
 Into the battle they thrust 
 With power and lust 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Punish and enslave 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Punish and enslave 
 There's something, a single spark 
 Out there in the dark 
 The metal is shining bright 
 Brings back hope and light 
 Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland 
 Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Punish and enslave 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Punish and enslave 
 All hail the chosen one - Fight proud, don't touch the sun 
 Come join our steel parade - Together in the last crusade 
 All drop the hammers down - Burn out, reclaim the crown 
 Speed demons never turn - at speed of light we ride, running flat-out let's crash and burn 
 They're vapourizing the earth, no mercy 
 Into the battle they thrust 
 Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland 
 Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Punish and enslave 
 Oh-oh-oh...

 A man on a mission was left at fates hand 
 In his eyes you could see the whites turn red 
 Surrounded by evil, abandoned for dead 
 Born on the run by the sign of the sun 
 A mail-clad warrior, the chosen one 
 His name's been cursed, he is bound to fail 
 A wandering spirit with the will to prevail 
 By the sign of the moon, 
 He swore the oath to fight alone 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without honor, and you're destined to 
 Fall 
 He still can recall his father's words 
 "Don't lose your faith, let your voice be heard" 
 Echoes from the past will lead him on 
 By these words of honor, shine like the sun 
 By the sign of the moon 
 He swore the oath to fight alone 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without honor, and you're destined to 
 Fall 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without soul and you will loose it all 
 The prophecies spoke of a wandering man 
 Skilled with steel, black as the night 
 Normally veiled from the mortal eyes 
 His hammer arose like a magic force 
 With a gaze that turned everything into stone 
 The warrior spoke, "I am the one" 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without honor, and you're destined to 
 Fall 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without soul and you will loose it all 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without honor, and you're destined to 
 Fall 
 Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without soul and you will loose it allHeed the words, my son 
 Here is where my journey ends 
 I pass my legacy, for you to carry on 
 You are the future, I am the past 
 These words of wisdom might be my very last 
 The insurrection will show your direction 
 After years of deceit 
 The future's in deadlock the peal of the death clock 
 A red-blooded brick in the wall 
 Retrogression here in neverland 
 Carry through utopia 
 (r) Evolution - rise and resist 
 (r) Evolution - fight to exist 
 (r) Evolution - a wrecking ball 
 (r) Evolution - free for all 
 Years of oppression, dark agony 
 No evolution, the unborns dim destiny 
 Retaliation unite our nations 
 All give heed to the call 
 You're the selected, preferred and elected 
 A red-blooded brick in the wall 
 Wave your banners here in neverland 
 Speak up for utopia 
 (r) Evolution - rise and resist 
 (r) Evolution - fight to exist 
 (r) Evolution - a wrecking ball 
 (r) Evolution - free for all 
 Cause no sticks and stones 
 Could ever break my bones 
 Nor their words 
 Could ever quench my soul 
 (r) Evolution - rise and resist 
 (r) Evolution - fight to exist 
 (r) Evolution - a wrecking ball 
 (r) Evolution - free for all 
 (r) Evolution - rise and resist 
 (r) Evolution - fight to exist 
 (r) Evolution - a wrecking ball 
 (r) Evolution - free for allReturned from the dark side I found a greater truth 
 No doubts or delusions, no higher absolute 
 A walk through the ages, through history and time 
 I've seen all the treason, all done by mankind 
 I deny your illusions 
 Reject your forceful demands 
 My dreams are so real now; they all come alive 
 The age of enlightenment, the power of your mind 
 Wheels of history turning 
 Re-spinning out of control 
 So many mountains climb to be falsified 
 My spirit is second to none 
 And my heart can't be denied 
 My soul is my furnace, my never ending craze 
 My body is my temple a well-protected maze 
 False messiah, rejected 
 Return to your distorted prophecies 
 So many mountains climb to be falsified 
 My spirit is second to none 
 And my heart can't be denied 
 Returned from the light side 
 Some answers left to find 
 In search of my brothers 
 My one of a kind 
 So many mountains climb to be falsified 
 My spirit is second to none 
 And my heart can't be denied 
 My heart is torn between heaven and hell 
 Your gods are rejected 
 All false prophets will fallSacrifice - Victory 
 No Sacrifice - No Victory 
 Once there was gold at the end of the rainbow 
 Honored by blood we kept searching for more 
 Light turned to dark as we lost what we fought for 
 Now we have come to settle the score 
 Sacrifice - Victory 
 No Sacrifice - No Victory 
 Light, brings us light on the pale darkened heavens 
 Lead us towards our vast victory 
 Fighting for all that we brothers believe in 
 Together, united we're standing all for one 
 On our pathway to glory, we stand together and honored by blood 
 Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever 
 By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die 
 Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory 
 Solo: Pontus Norgren 
 In the end only truth will survive, no matter what you sacrifice 
 So you can't harvest your glory all based on deceit, 'cause no one will swallow your lies 
 On our pathway to glory, we stand together honored by blood 
 Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever 
 By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die 
 Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory 
 Sacrifice - Victory 
 Sacrifice - Victory 
 VictoryIt's been a long cold winter, widespread snowfall, raging storms 
 Caught in winds delusions, of our heart and soul 
 He came down from the mountains, into our own frozen world 
 Spoke of revolution, fed us with his words 
 A sacred man, from the other side 
 He gave us something to believe in 
 How could we be so blind? 
 His right hand gave us freedom, while the other stole the pride 
 Thought he had the answers, standing by his side 
 Tales of a world, not so far away 
 We got entangled in his vows 
 How could we be so blind? 
 When the sun and moon unite 
 Fear Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words 
 (Solo: Stefan) 
 A graven image shattered, a meltdown of our wonderland 
 As the sun rised slowly, we tried to understand 
 A sacred heart, lost prosperity 
 But we found a way back home 
 From dusk came clarity 
 When the sun and moon unite 
 Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words 
 When the sun and moon unite 
 Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened wordsIt's been a long way but now we are near 
 The midst of the fiery rain 
 We know the Thunder have summoned us all 
 To the place were innocence got slain 
 Behold the omens, the rivers run red 
 The autumn winds carry the dead 
 The final warning, the very last command 
 Shattered remains for the damned 
 We won't surrender 
 No never, we will carry on 
 From the Lake of Fire they have come 
 Fierce almighty legions, one by one 
 When the Flames of Glory touch the sky 
 Trailblazers do or die 
 We are the mighty, who soar through the air, 
 Creating our own destiny 
 Warriors once and Warriors to be 
 Forever our spirits fly free 
 We rode on lightning we shone like the sun 
 In a thunderous symphony 
 We fought them hard we fought them so brave, 
 Sending them back to their grave 
 The Hammer has fallen 
 The fire still burns in our hearts 
 From the Lake of Fire they have come 
 Fierce almighty legions, one by one 
 When the Flames of Glory touch the sky 
 Trailblazers do or die 
 The visions we gazed upon, 
 As the nightmare returned 
 On the uncaring slopes 
 The mark of the shadows still burns 
 From the Lake of Fire they have come 
 Fierce almighty legions, one by one 
 When the Flames of Glory touch the sky 
 Trailblazers do or die 
 From the Lake of Fire they have come 
 Fierce almighty legions, one by one 
 When the Flames of Glory touch the sky 
 Trailblazers do or dieGrey morning, dawn won the fight 
 Daylight drives away the night 
 Fog's rising out in the fields 
 The birth of winter is in sight 
 Dark shadow's fall from the sky 
 They alight on gallows tree 
 Black feathers, amber beaks 
 Waiting for their Deity 
 Leaves are spinning 'round 
 Lost and never found 
 When the King takes the Crown 
 Can you feel 
 The autumn wind blowing 
 Ravenlord is coming to stay 
 Can you hear 
 The passing bell tolling 
 Ravenlord - takes you far away 
 Sharp talons, pinions of ice 
 They obscure the new-born day 
 Hot breathing freezes to snow 
 Piercing caws lead you astray 
 Leaves are spinning 'round...Sighs 
 The fury has electrified my mind 
 Sighs 
 The hatred burns inside 
 By the mark of vengeance I will grind 
 Sighs 
 The sound of metal falling to the ground 
 Sighs 
 By blood we will unite 
 By blood we are forever bound 
 Vengeance calling me 
 Oh, please set me free 
 The fury of the wild 
 Locked up in this cage 
 Can't you feel the rage? 
 The fury of the wild 
 Sighs 
 Your silence will not sanctify your crime 
 Sighs 
 When revolution calls, I will be the first in line 
 Vengeance calling me 
 Oh, please set me free 
 The fury of the wild 
 Locked up in this cage 
 Can't you feel the rage? 
 The fury of the wild 
 Now as you stand on your own 
 With the future, face to face 
 Take a look at me now 
 Feel the fury, taste my rage 
 Come taste my revenge 
 Unbent, unbowed, unbroken 
 Vengeance calling me 
 Oh, please set me free 
 The fury of the wild 
 Locked up in this cage 
 Can't you feel the rage? 
 The fury of the wildFire burns! Fire burns! Fire burns! 
 You danced with the devil, 
 Now your soul is bruised and scarred. 
 There ain't no pride and dignity: 
 We've been down the rusty boulevard. 
 You lived your life, 
 Thought you'd be immortalized. 
 The moral of your story: 
 What goes up must come back down. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever more. 
 A moment of silence 
 Just before you hit the stage: 
 This is your day of reckoning 
 To pay back all the dues and turn the page. 
 You hit rock bottom 
 And you stood the count to ten. 
 Came back to harvest glory, 
 Now your star will shine again. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever more. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever more. 
 'Cause every step, 
 The light races follow. 
 'Cause every move we make 
 Might be our last mistake. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever more. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever. 
 Fire burns! 
 The fire burns forever more. 
 Fire, fire, burn!Our time has come, get ready fight

 This is the waySo here I am once more, the devil in disguise 
 You've seen me before 
 I stray the earth alone, across the seven seas 
 To settle the score 
 I stand behind, I am your dark reflection 
 Last thing you see when you die 
 Demonized 
 Possessed by the devil, I'm in disguise 
 A black-hearted soul screaming all but lies 
 Welcome to enter my final mass 
 A sinister snake in the grass 
 So many times before 
 I've seen the world go down 
 By the touch of my hand 
 So if you wanna fly, wanna fly across the sky 
 To find the promised land 
 Your wings will burn 
 There's nothing left above us 
 A paradise lost to my crown 
 You spread your wings, melting in the sunlight 
 The fear of the future, hands down 
 Demonized 
 Possessed by the devil, I'm in disguise 
 A black-hearted soul screaming all but lies 
 Welcome to enter my final mass 
 A sinister snake in the grass 
 I'm strung-out, I am the air that you breathe 
 I will make you choke, addicted 
 I feed on your needs 
 Demonized 
 Possessed by the devil, I'm in disguise 
 A black-hearted soul screaming all but lies 
 Welcome to enter my final mass 
 A sinister snake in the grass 
 Demonized 
 Possessed by the devil, I'm in disguise 
 A black-hearted soul screaming all but lies 
 Welcome to enter my final mass 
 A sinister snake in the grassI feel uptight on a Saturday night 
 Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light 
 I hear my song and it pulls me through 
 Comes on strong, tells me what I gotta do 
 I got to 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 Getting late, I just can't wait 
 Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road 
 First I drink, then I smoke 
 Start the car and I try to make the midnight show 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 Movin' fast, down 95 
 Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow 
 I feel so good, I'm so alive 
 Hear my song playin' on the radio 
 It goes 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock 
 There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes 
 Oh my God, no time to turn 
 I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die 
 Why? 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seatSolo: Stefan Elmgren 
 There was a time when we were noble soldiers 
 Fearless and wild, a fight just to survive 
 Reformed our troops, one flag one world united 
 Under the sun the powers came alive 
 The sound of our cause, the meaning of life 
 Beyond stars and skies 
 Now raise your hands and let it all come out 
 Bring the Hammer Down 
 Slam it down to the ground 
 One flag, one world united 
 Templars, fight or fall 
 Raise your fists, heed the call 
 Bring the Hammer Down, behold the light 
 The future holds nothing but pain and sorrow 
 No painted skies, we dwell in black and white 
 Just live your life, like there is no tomorrow 
 Present today, forgotten before dawn 
 Still counting the stars, in search for a way 
 The meaning of life 
 Now raise your hands before your time runs out 
 Solo: Pontus, Stefan, bothThe morning breaks 
 As a new day begins 
 And I'm still on the road 
 To nowhere 
 No sign of life 
 In his eyes 
 No emotion shown at all 
 Just like water through my hands 
 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder 
 Screams (Scream) 
 Can you hear the screaming? 
 When another restless soul must die 
 A glorious ride 
 To become immortalized 
 As you sought your inner dreams 
 And visions 
 Your final words 
 Caught by the wind 
 Never to be heard again 
 Your last will to be forever free 
 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder 
 Screams (Scream) 
 Can you hear the screaming 
 When another restless soul 
 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder

 When another restless soul must die 
 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder

 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder

 In his heart, in his eyes, in his soul 
 There's no sign of thunder 
 Screams (Scream) 
 Can you hear the screaming 
 When another restless soul must dieThere is a crying in the nightfall 
 There is a howling in the wind 
 And when the urge is getting stronger 
 We hit the streets, the city calls 
 The night is free for all 
 We rule the dark and we do as we please 
 And nothing can stop us 
 No time to catch some Z's 
 Howlin' With The 'Pac 
 Fighting for the right to be 
 Howlin' With The 'Pac 
 Templars of the first degree 
 We never minded any warnings 
 Or asked directions from the stars 
 And when the moon stops it's ascending 
 We feel the rush, the inner glow 
 The crimson will flow 
 We have the might, and the power to succeed 
 And nothing can stop us 
 'Cause we're the restless breed 
 Howlin' With The 'Pac 
 Fighting for the right to be 
 Howlin' With The 'Pac 
 Templars of the first degree 
 And when our allegiance is falling down 
 We will crawl back from hell 
 Reclaim the crown 
 The sign is shining for us 
 Its glow will lead us on our way 
 When we are led astray 
 No, no!

 I am the one running out of control 
 I am faster than the speed of light 
 There is a darkness surrounding my life 
 And its claws gotta hold of my sight 
 I'm leaving the past behind, wander off into the wild 
 Pin down my future at last, moving on nowhere fast 
 Like a wildfire 
 Wildfire - wildfire - wildfire 
 Hellbent for metal it clouded my mind 
 Like a force of destruction and rage 
 Possessed by possessions, it all choked me up 
 I must fly bursting out of my cage 
 I'm free, set at liberty, no chains are pinning me down 
 My scornful eye takes me places, no one dares to go 
 Like a wildfire 
 Wildfire - wildfire - wildfire 
 Wildfire - wildfire - wildfire 
 Bathe in the rays of the sun 
 Feeding my inner flame 
 Why are we wasting our time 
 Watching horizons go down 
 Standing there patient in one fine line 
 Wildfire - wildfire - wildfire 
 Wildfire - wildfire - wildfireSo where were you when darkness came to life? 
 Inside a dream that controlled your inner plight 
 Take a look at me, you've ruined what we had 
 Inner visions, infrared, it drives me mad 
 Out of control 
 The system mounted on the wall 
 For every soul there's no way out 
 In this world where nothing lives 
 The walls are caving in, life's a sin 
 In this world we have to give 
 Before we all can see the Templar Flame 
 Do you believe surveillance is the cure? 
 The remedy for our insanity 
 Take a look around and tell me what you see 
 Souls walking planlessly like you and me 
 In infrared 
 Controlling what is left to see 
 Awake the dead, there's no way out 
 In this world where nothing lives 
 The walls are caving in, life's a sin 
 In this world we have to give 
 Before we all can see the Templar Flame 
 You see the words - speak 
 In infrared - speak 
 You see the words 
 Damn the machine - speak 
 Speak of the flame... 
 The Templar Flame 
 Oh, oh, oh...In 1981, the metal struck like thunder 
 The harmonious noise all linked in one voice 
 A croon across the nation 
 My soul was ripped and torn, I couldn't resist the power 
 The music I heard, the thunderous words 
 My gate to liberation 
 It made us rock it made us lose our self control 
 Bang Your Head - Stand United 
 It was the spark, the flame, setting our hearts on fire 
 Creating our dreams, our lives and our means 
 We're howling with desire 
 We came to rock we came to lose our self control 
 Bang Your Head - Stand United 
 The years kept passing by 
 No wind of change could bring us down 
 'Cause we are one my friend 
 We stand together till the end 
 This is our destiny 
 Our will, our life our honored crown 
 Our dream is ours to dream 
 Our beat's out beat forevermore 
 Now, Templars, bang your heads and unite 
 It made us rock it made us roll forever more 
 Bang Your Head - Stand United 
 Bang Your Head - Stand United 
 Bang Your Head! 
 Bang Your Head! 
 Bang Your Head! 
 Bang Your Head!Day after day, we all try to find a way 
 Fighting to be brave 
 Keep the wicked far at bay 
 We ride across the battlefield 
 There's nothing left to find 
 You hear the vultures cry 
 Now their task is yours to grind 
 The last sun will soon ignite! 
 An ever-lasting blight 
 We must find the Star of Home 
 Time will end at break of dawn 
 One more odyssey remain 
 Leave this desert plain 
 Destination's far away 
 Into universe we stray 
 To a place known as forever 
 Countdown begins 
 We must leave this place of sin 
 There's blood everywhere 
 When the river's running red 
 A vigil for the dying world 
 Resurrections last crusade 
 Fragments left of life 
 Shattered pieces from the blade 
 A deathwatch for the human race 
 Life's falling down from grace 
 We must find the Star of Home 
 Time will end at break of dawn 
 One more odyssey remain 
 Leave this desert plain 
 Destination's far away 
 Into universe we stray 
 To a place known as forever 
 Across the sacred universe we travel on 
 We'll find our remedy 
 Our home away from home... travel on 
 We must find the Star of Home 
 Time will end at break of dawn 
 One more odyssey remain 
 Leave this desert plain 
 Destination's far away 
 Into universe we stray 
 To a place known as foreverSee the outlaw stands alone beneath the burning sun 
 The raging badlands now is his home 
 There's no sign of victory, he lost his liberty 
 And the only woman that he loved 
 An outlaw chasing outlaws, a runner in the night 
 By the radiant moon he will strike 
 The seeker of all dangers has come to take his toll 
 From the dead of night he will arise 
 Renegade, Renegade 
 Committed the ultimate sin 
 Renegade, Renegade 
 This time the prowler will win 
 He stalks in shadow lands, soundless, with gun in hand 
 Striking like a reptile, so fierce 
 No chance to get away, no time for your last prayer 
 When the prowler sneaks up from behind 
 An outlaw chasing outlaws, the hunter takes his pray 
 The law of the jungle he obeys 
 Craving for the danger to even out the scores 
 Face to face, once and for all 
 Renegade, renegade 
 Committed the ultimate sin 
 Renegade, renegade 
 This time the prowler will win 
 On through the night he rides, on his raging horse made of steel 
 Nothing can save you now, before the renegade you will kneel 
 Renegade, Renegade 
 Committed the ultimate sin 
 Renegade, renegade 
 This time the prowler will win 
 Renegade, Renegade 
 Committed the ultimate sin 
 Renegade, renegade 
 This time the prowler will winYou come to see the show

 M.Z.A.Late at night in the park 
 I saw them slipping in the dark 
 For heaven sake, what's going on? 
 It's like someone is here 
 Gotta follow now 
 Like being in a trance for me 
 There's silence here 
 More than all the noise 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Every day, every night 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Oh yeah 
 Down on my knees, God help me please 
 Gotta know who's out in the dark 
 I've stopped my breath, can't feel the hands 
 Could hear the sound of people making love 
 I surrender right now 
 I've to be touched 
 I feel so much 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Every day, every night 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Yeah 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Every day, every night 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Every day, every night 
 Spurting in the dark, head over heels 
 Overheated heart, head over heels 
 Treating it so hard, the spurting feels 
 Every day, every night 
 Head over heels 
 Head over heels 
 Every day, every night 
 Head over heels 
 Head over heels 
 Every day, every night 
 Head over heels 
 Head over heels 
 Every day, every nightI gave up my life 
 To follow another destiny 
 To find the hidden sun 
 The source of the spark and the flame 
 Now the universe is closed 
 Let the blackening, dissolution start 
 The aether shining, impurified 
 Let's burn out the vile from the dark 
 Vile from the dark 
 I kneel down and pray 
 The elements gather around me 
 Envision my destined path 
 I can no longer avoid 
 I see the... 
 Black sun rising 
 Fall, material god 
 Opus Magnum 
 Seize Redemption 
 My uprising 
 Find the sun and the moon 
 Absolution 
 Seize Redemption 
 Unification, the spiritualized 
 Will unlock the gate be unlimited 
 Unification of man and his god 
 Will limit your life lock the gate 
 Now the elements are at peace 
 Come the reddening, gaze upon the sky 
 Seven planets, silver and gold 
 The seven metals aligned 
 And now the... 
 Black sun rising 
 Fall, material god 
 Opus Magnum 
 Seize Redemption 
 My uprising 
 Find the sun and the moon 
 Absolution 
 Seize Redemption 
 Black sun rising 
 Fall, material god 
 Opus Magnum 
 Seize Redemption 
 My uprising 
 Find the sun and the moon 
 Absolution 
 Seize RedemptionThere are clouds on the horizon 
 Shifting colours, heavy rain 
 High above the roaring thunder 
 Shooting bullets through your brain 
 There's something wicked left behind 
 A baleful sight, a coming 
 A sinister state of your minds 
 Behold the skies, the port of heaven 
 Take the stairway down to hell 
 The gate is open, lift the curse 
 We set aside our dreams and visions 
 We are one we will unite 
 At the Threshold of the universe we will rise 
 Late at night they heard the sirens 
 From a place so far away 
 Allied forces, mighty brethren 
 In a vesture of decay 
 They are the legions of the night 
 Turning darkness into... 
 Turning the dark into light 
 Behold the skies, the port of heaven 
 Take the stairway down to hell 
 The gate is open, lift the curse 
 We set aside our dreams and visions 
 We are one we will unite 
 At the Threshold of the universe 
 Solo: Stefan 
 Behold the skies, the port of heaven 
 Take the stairway down to hell 
 The gate is open, lift the curse 
 We set aside our dreams and visions 
 We are one we will unite 
 At the Threshold of the universeNever thought I'd feel again 
 Feel the darkness fade and see the morning sun arise 
 Never thought I'd feel alive again 
 Senses dull and blunt from all the lies 
 Now, when I hold your face so close to mine 
 I see a place where the sun will shine 
 With you it is divine 
 Looking down into those eyes 
 I know 
 I'll be lost and never found again 
 Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die 
 Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side 
 (If) Dreams Come True 
 Do I dare to trust this time? 
 Ooh, the Bells of Fortune 
 Will I ever hear them chime? 
 Only those who have been burned before 
 Truly know the meaning of Hell's flaming core 
 I was the brooding night and you were dawn 
 Saving me, for I was forlorn 
 In your light I am reborn 
 Looking down into those eyes 
 I know 
 I'll be lost and never found again 
 Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die 
 Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side 
 (If) Dreams Come True 
 Then, when the walls are breaking down on us 
 When all we see is misery 
 Will you still believe in me? 
 Looking down into those eyes 
 I know 
 I'll be lost and never found again 
 Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die 
 Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side 
 Until the sign of winter (Dreams Come True) 
 Always by your side...The passion of broken hearts, the passion of pain 
 Flames of the mortal world, the fire still burns 
 Out of the dark, the winter is coming 
 The passion of broken souls, their passion is pain 
 Forever crying, forever dead 
 Out of the dark, the winter is coming 
 Out of the dark, the winter is near 
 I am lost in confusion 
 I am trapped between worlds 
 I'm a wolf on the prowl in the night 
 Take the black, you win or you die 
 First of the ancient men, the bloodline is strong 
 A star from beyond the wall will rescue us all? 
 Out of the dark, the winter is coming 
 Out of the dark, the winter is hereWhere have I been? I don't know where to begin 
 Memories flash, right and painfully clash 
 Forever gone, my mind is clear but undone 
 Storms raging on, sensing the other one 
 Here, in the thunderous silence I sit, petrified 
 Knowing the Twilight Princess will come 
 I hear her lies, piercing through me, hypnotized 
 Cursing the skies, who I become, I despise 
 I had no choice 
 All is lost - can't rejoice 
 Nothing but noise 
 And her sweet, sweet voice 
 No, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again 
 It's the Twilight Princess I fear 
 Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world 
 Because the Twilight Princess is here 
 Give me a reason, you won't give me a sign 
 Give me a reason to cross the line 
 Darkness has come 
 And the last rays of sunlight are gone 
 What matters now won't matter soon 
 In the light of the moon 
 I once was dead, time standing still and at last 
 Free in my head, never remember the past 
 I must obey, finding an innocent prey 
 To make the Twilight Princess smile 
 Always astray, need her to show me the way 
 It is my Twilight Princess' trial 
 Yes, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again 
 It's the Twilight Princess I see 
 Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world 
 Because the Twilight Princess is me 
 She's always with meOn a dusty shelf, buried over ground 
 In the corner of the attic 
 Where the bats come out and play 
 Oh, they linger on 
 Preserved, embraced in silence 
 A script, a tale, kept from the light of day 
 The fear of God 
 A recital of a story only for the strong to find 
 As you kneel down, you feel the cold wind blow 
 Kill the switch, lock all the exits 
 The curse, the spell, the words begin to glow 
 The sun is silent 
 Nine circles, the passage into the abyss 
 Ex inferis, remember my name 
 Ex inferis, demon from hell 
 Abandon hope as you step inside 
 The rebellion of angels 
 Who reside these darkened shores 
 Oh, waist deep in ice 
 Surrounded by the fire 
 The purgatory gate, nowhere to go 
 This is your calling 
 Malicious and violent, the circles of hell 
 Limbo, lust and gluttony 
 Rage out of control 
 Greed and anger, heresy 
 The price to cleanse thy soul 
 Ex inferis, remember my name 
 Ex inferis, demon from hell 
 Ex inferis, remember my name 
 Ex inferis, demon from hell 
 All for one, but none for all 
 Enslaved, we will succumb 
 Violence, fraud, no kingdome come 
 Reborn in treachery 
 Ex inferis, remember my name 
 Ex inferis, demon from hell 
 Ex inferis, remember my name 
 Ex inferis, demon from hell 
 Ex inferisOnce, there was a time when we were standing back 
 To back against the whole conception 
 Once, we had it all, the world was a precious home 
 Times were changing fast, our dreams were fading black 
 The darkness fell on our creation 
 Time was running out, we were falling one by one 
 We live by honor, we fight for freedom, we die but you can't slay our pride 
 Behind these walls we deem, take hold of the dream 
 To live our lives as we please 
 Metal Genocide 
 No fear, we know the end is near 
 One day we will retaliate, 
 Genocide! 
 Fall, mighty Babylon your might is declining fast 
 You're on your knees, repent your sinning 
 Far, beyond the realms of hell we are born again 
 We live by honor, we fight for freedom, we die but you can't slay our pride 
 Behind these walls we deem, take hold of the dream 
 To live our lives as we please 
 Metal Genocide 
 No fear, we know the end is near 
 One day we will retaliate, 
 Genocide! 
 (Solo:Stefan) 
 Behind these walls we deem, take hold of the dream 
 To live our lives as we please 
 Metal Genocide 
 No fear, we know the end is near 
 One day we will retaliate 
 Behind these walls we deem, take hold of the dream 
 To live our lives as we please 
 Metal Genocide 
 No fear, we know the end is near 
 One day we will retaliate, 
 Genocide!Hammer high, this is a freedom cry! 
 Hammer high, no one should ask me why! 
 It's my life - proudly I will defy! 
 Hammer high until I die! 
 Black clouds on the horizon 
 Dread crimson skies 
 The thunder within, the sign to begin 
 A tempest of fire and ice 
 I keep my courage blazing 
 Withhold this grounds 
 Protecting the steal, this is my deal 
 The flames of my anger, my will! 
 Remember the frozen tears 
 Turning each second to years 
 A meltdown in paradise 
 Revolution calling! Break the ice! 
 Hammer high, this is a freedom cry! 
 Hammer high, no one should ask me why! 
 It's my life - proudly I will defy! 
 Hammer high until I die! 
 The rapid fire pounding 
 To the beat of my heart 
 Let's make a stand 
 True to till the end 
 Warrior under command 
 I'm melting the frozen ice 
 Burning the books filled with lies 
 And inside the pouring rain 
 Things will never ever be the same! 
 Hammer high, this is a freedom cry! 
 Hammer high, no one should ask me why! 
 It's my life - proudly I will defy! 
 Hammer high until I die! 
 The strong will survive 
 In the end, it's the game 
 Forever defy! 
 Hammer high up in the sacred sky! 
 Hammer high, this is a freedom cry! 
 Hammer high, no one should ask me why! 
 It's my life - proudly I will defy! 
 Hammer high until I die! 
 Hear me now this is a freedom cry 
 It's my life - no one should ask me why! 
 Hammer high I won't conform and die! 
 Will defy until I die! 
 Hammer high, this is a freedom cry! 
 Hammer high, no one should ask me why! 
 It's my life - proudly I will defy! 
 Hammer high until I die!Who's there 
 Walking the shadows I fear 
 I am in deep 
 The nightmares they won't disappear 
 Leave me alone 
 Lay down 
 Lay down your arms on the ground 
 You've been sent here 
 To champion for the unbound, yeah 
 Satan's scheme falls into place 
 An evil grin upon his face 
 No fear 
 The duels about to begin 
 I've got a black hand 
 The hand of the dead man can win, yeah 
 Satan slips another ace 
 A thousand souls will fall from grace 
 Evil incarnate, the son of man 
 Lost to the great deceiver 
 Evil incarnate, I failed the plan 
 A new inception reigns 
 Evil incarnate, the son of man 
 Lost to the great deceiver 
 Evil incarnate, I failed the plan 
 A new inception reignsThe hands of time have brought you here 
 To make a change, to break down the walls 
 You are the ones and you are the only 
 Trying to live by your own goals 
 And you all cry for freedom 
 Raise your fists to the sky 
 Let your voice speak for the revolution 
 All join forces with all the powers that you feel 
 Let your heart beat for the revolution 
 Led by the Templars of Steel 
 Let's spread the word of the sole survivors 
 With metal pounding inside their souls 
 The fire burns, and it will forever 
 Blaze for the ones who stands strong 
 And you all cry for freedom 
 With your fists in the sky 
 Let your voice speak for the revolution 
 All join forces with all the powers that you feel 
 Let your heart beat for the revolution 
 Led by the Templars of Steel 
 You are the Templars of Steel 
 Oh, oh, oh ... 
 Let your voice speak for the revolution 
 All join forces with all the powers that you feel 
 Let your heart beat for the revolution 
 Led by the Templars of Steel 
 Let your voice speak for the revolution 
 All join forces with all the powers that you feel 
 Let your heart beat for the revolution 
 Led by the Templars of Steel 
 You are the Templars of SteelIt started with the holy water rising to a boil 
 The crops went bad, no life could breed, beneath the rotten soil 
 Imprisoned for his make beliefs, impending dire views 
 Became accountable for every flaw, spreading the news 
 Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie 
 Seven flights of imagination 
 These taunting dreams no one could read or even understand 
 Delusion of insanity, banned from his fatherland 
 Just leave the ship and swim ashore, life's hanging by a thread 
 Days of mass destruction, harmageddon, lies ahead 
 Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie 
 Seven flights of imagination 
 Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead 
 To the allegation 
 Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree 
 Eternal damnation 
 So, seven years of devastation followed in the land 
 One for every prophecy, served by the almighty hand 
 The outlaw was imprisoned for scattering his dreams 
 None stood up to hold his ground, spineless so it seems 
 Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie 
 Seven flights of imagination 
 Bring out the Outlaw, could you forsee 
 The allegation 
 Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree 
 Eternal damnation 
 Let us bring out the Outlaw 
 A life could be saved, if someone stood up for his rights 
 Now cursed and condemned, mistreated on his last nocturnal flight 
 Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead 
 To the allegation 
 Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree 
 Eternal damnation 
 Call for the Outlaw, help us forsee 
 God's allegation 
 Call for the Outlaw, charge us, decree 
 Eternal damnationBack in 1095, when the call to arms came 
 We had the red cross sewn on 
 Sent to save the holy land and crush the infidels 
 With strength from above 
 Steel meets steel 
 On towards victory we march, the guiding star 
 Lead us to the battle field 
 There, the heathens were subdued, and in the end 
 We forced them all to yield or die 
 Steel meets steel 
 In July in '99, the Holy City was stormed and won 
 Jerusalem was freed, we thanked the lord for our glory 
 We, the Templars, have survived by honor and pride 
 And the blessing of the sword 
 The quest of the war, forever sung 
 To the sound of steel meets steel 
 Steel meets steelI breathe alone, my skin begins to peel 
 Forsaken in my misery to battle this ordeal 
 I can't resist the cravings, no I have to ease the pain 
 My screaming brain is melting slowly, turning me insane 
 Devastation all across the nation 
 Infected, but I am not alone 
 My days are numbered but I am patient 
 From zero the counting has begun 
 I resist resistance, I survive the hangman's noose 
 Future looks sinister, I'm a zombie on the loose 
 'Cause I feed in darkness, I feast in broad daylight 
 Whatever you do, better hold on tight and stay out of my sight 
 Evacuation all across the nation 
 Infected, but I am not alone 
 Our days are numbered and we are patient 
 To zero the countdown has begun 
 We exist but our hearts don't beat 
 The streets, our sacred haven 
 Fight or flee don't waste another round 
 We exist, but our eyes run red 
 The dead will feast upon you 
 Aiming high, don't chocke or you'll be downed 
 Retribution a suicide solution 
 Infected but you are not alone 
 Our lives are numbered and we are all patient 
 To zero the countdown has begunRide through the valley in thunder and rain 
 The battle is raging, redeem this domain 
 The Castle of Eden lies silent above 
 Darkness surrounded us, away we must go 
 I look through the eyes of the world 
 I see there's a Stranger among us. 
 Awaiting a sign from above 
 To conquer the power and the glory 
 Enter the battle, our will to enchain 
 Bringing us forward, defeating the pain 
 Into the meeting with swords made of steel 
 We're standing together the secret reveals 
 I look through the eyes of the world 
 I know who's the Stranger among us 
 Awaiting a sign from above 
 To conquer the power and glory 
 Repeat 2x 
 Come across to the Promised Land 
 Close your eyes, I will take your hand 
 Through the river of steel we'll go 
 When the dragon lies bleeding 
 Above the glory we'll carry on 
 Now the time has come to return back home 
 The setting sun illuminates the dead 
 The battlefield field is shining red. 
 Silent lies Eden on top of the moor 
 We're fighting with honor protecting our Lord 
 The last one survivor lies bleeding, I kneel 
 Into his heart I settle the steel 
 I look through the eyes of the world 
 There is no stranger among us. 
 We march to the end of the world 
 In search for the power and the glory 
 Repeat 4x 
 Come across to the Promised Land 
 Close your eyes, I will take your hand 
 Through the river of steel we'll go 
 When the dragon lies bleedingThere's never been any reason 
 Or escape for the treason 
 You just think of a time far away 
 I feel your flame and your anguish 
 I know your plans and your last wish 
 You just can't face another day 
 Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland 
 Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs, 
 It's the End, it's the End 
 You've stood along the life line 
 You've played the fool for the last time 
 You just want the joy and the peace 
 You've heard all the laughter 
 You've seen what you're after 
 You just want the rest and the sleep 
 Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland 
 Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs, 
 It's the End, it's the End 
 Angel Of Mercy, Angel Of Mercy 
 Lead: Stefan 
 Solo: Stefan 
 You can hear the clock's tick 
 As you scheme for your last fix, 
 From a place you never will awake 
 I hear your cry into the night 
 I hear you die within my fright 
 But now you've saved your mistake 
 Angel Of Mercy... 
 Angel of Mercy, Angel of Mercy 
 Solo: Stefan 
 Angel of Mercy, Angel of MercyI cover the trail behind me, stay out of the light 
 There's something alive in the darkness 
 I can feel the power and its might 
 For years I have walked in the shadows 
 Banned for my beliefs 
 Cause around me the walls are falling 
 Bridges burn, in flames without a spark 
 'Cause I'm searching high and low 
 Through dark places I must go 
 I am the one you should not blame 
 Hallowed be my Name - My Name 
 There's no place for me in heaven, nor a place in hell 
 Sentenced to walk here forever 
 This will be my final place to dwell 
 I walk alone, no legions will follow my path 
 A stranger to my own shadow 
 But something's wrong I can feel it to the bone 
 When I stand on sea and shore 
 Storms will rage and ocean roar 
 I raise my hammer, take my aim 
 Hallowed be my Name - My Name 
 Vultures fly, the ravens cry 
 No stars are shining on the darkened sky 
 One allegiance, sun and moon 
 My eyes are red my soul is turning into black 
 When I stand on sea and shore 
 Storms will rage and ocean roar 
 I raise my hammer, take my aim 
 Cause Hallowed be my Name 
 You can lie and crush my heart 
 Steal my soul, tear me apart 
 Still it's something you cannot claim 
 Hallowed be my Name - My NameOur sun is set, our day is done 
 I'm left here wondering 
 Is this the end, my final words to you 
 Day turned to night 
 Now you're gone I'm left here pondering 
 Can this be true, are we really through? 
 You were the wind beneath my wings 
 Taught me how to fly 
 With you, I lived among the kings 
 How could this ever die? 
 So I say farewell, I'm yours forever 
 And I always will be 
 We were one, we were all, we were the only 
 Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way 
 But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely 
 I would walk through fire for just one more day 
 You were the angel of my life 
 Taught me to be free 
 Now I'm a stranger in your eyes 
 Walls are closing in on me 
 So I say farewell, I'm yours forever 
 And I always will be 
 Missing you in my heart, you are the one 
 And you always will be 
 When I turn to the east, I see no dawn 
 But after darkness comes the light 
 When I turn to the west, the silent night hides all 
 Where is the light that shines so bright? 
 So I say farewell, I'm yours forever 
 And I always will be 
 Missing you in my heart, you are the one 
 And you always will be 
 Nah-nah-na and you always will be 
 Nah-nah-na and you always will be 
 And you always will be 
 My little one, you are 
 And you always will beSnow is falling down on this glorious land 
 Colours fading, turning into white again 
 To fallen heroes angels sing, they cry their winter tears 
 Endless mourning days will turn to years 
 So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and 
 Spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away now 
 Nothing on earth stays forever 
 But none of your deeds were in vain 
 Deep in our hearts you will live again 
 You're gone to the home of the brave 
 Every solemn moment I will treasure inside 
 Even though it's hard to understand 
 That a silent wind can blow the candle out 
 Taking everything leaving the pain far behind 
 You call out my name, but your voice is fading 
 Into the wind, embraced, you'll fly away now, fly away 
 Now 
 Repeat x2: 
 Nothing on earth stays forever 
 But none of your deeds were in vain 
 Deep in our hearts you will live again 
 You're gone to the home of the brave 
 My eyes are closed I feel you're far away 
 Far beyond that shining star 
 I know you'll find what you've been fighting for 
 Far beyond that shining star 
 Down on bended knee I pray, bring courage to these Souls 
 Make'em live forever in the heart of the bold 
 So I say farewell my friends, I hope we'll meet again 
 When my time has come to fall from grace 
 So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and 
 Spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away now 
 Repeat x8: 
 Nothing on earth stays forever 
 But none of your deeds were in vain 
 Deep in our hearts you will live again 
 You're gone to the home of the braveSitting in my room, staring at the wall 
 I can't believe it's happening 
 Once so wonderful 
 Now life's a twisted kind of reality, a fantasy 
 Don't know where to begin 
 Saw your love for me vanish in a single moment of stupidity 
 Nightmare this may be, but it is not a dream, ooh 
 I want to scream; a broken heart still bleeds 
 Never, ever talk, never, ever smile 
 Knowing that my life won't be the same 
 Never, ever touch, never, ever feel 
 I will never hear you call my name... again 
 In my dreams I see, see you come to me 
 A memory of times of old 
 Waking up, I realize hell's as cool as ice 
 And the touch of sin did get me in 
 Nothing burns like the cold 
 Never, ever talk, never, ever smile 
 Knowing that my life won't be the same 
 Never, ever touch, never, ever feel 
 I will never hear you call my name... again 
 As we sin, so do we suffer 
 I've fallen from grace 
 Want to turn back time and make it undone 
 Never, ever talk, never, ever smile 
 Knowing that my life won't be the same 
 Never, ever touch, never, ever feel 
 I will never hear you call my name 
 Never, ever talk, never, ever smile 
 All I see: a future full of fear 
 Never, ever touch, never, ever feel 
 I can never whisper in your ear... I'm sorryYou come to see the show 
 Well, we're gonna rock and roll you 
 Come and get on your seat

 Heay Sing Heay...You made me see right past myself 
 Well beyond my fears 
 Realized I'm synchronized 
 Far beyond my years 
 I'm so geared into them 
 I serve unto their souls 
 Now that I'm addicted 
 My hunger only grows 
 I'm a Child of the Damned 
 I follow where I go 
 Rigging to the cross 
 As holy as a whore! 
 I'm just a child of the damned 
 Witches' coven the time is come 
 For those sabbatical years 
 Revelation is the message 
 For all in all to hear 
 Prophets slayed mankind arrayed 
 Into a mass submission 
 Evil's here and the lord of hell 
 Gives you the proposition! 
 I'm a Child of the Damned 
 I follow where I go 
 Rigging to the cross 
 As holy as a whore! 
 I'm just a child of the damned 
 Give away your life's goals 
 Your meaning and ambition 
 It means nothing to you 
 After all it's superstition! 
 Do not be afraid 
 The world is near the end 
 Is it better to rule in hell, 
 Than it is to serve in heaven? 
 I'm a Child of the Damned 
 I follow where I go 
 Rigging to the cross 
 As holy as a whore! 
 I'm just a child of the damnedThere's silence, in the dark 
 There's the fire, ready to start 
 Stone pages, inked by fury 
 The exception of the damned 
 They are calling, out my name 
 Come join us and carry the flame 
 Our precious time, is standing still 
 When the future meets the past 
 No freedom, no glory 
 There's no future, no past 
 This will be our one last wish, one last dream 
 When you follow the masses, or follow your own 
 One last chance, one last dream 
 Before your future will be, Carved In Stone 
 I remember, what they said 
 I still hear them, inside me head 
 The legions of damnation 
 They keep calling out my name 
 The wind blows, forever 
 But the time standing still 
 This will be our one last wish, one last dream 
 When you follow the masses, or follow your own 
 One last chance, one last dream 
 Before your future will be, Carved In Stone 
 Knock, knock on my door 
 Please revoke what you're asking for 
 One last wish, one last dream 
 When you follow the masses, or follow your own 
 One last chance, one last dream 
 Before your future will be... 
 One last wish, one last dream (Carved In Stone) 
 When you follow the masses, or follow your own 
 One last chance, one last dream (Carved In Stone) 
 Before your future will be, Carved In StoneAs I open up my eyes 
 I see a face I don't recognize 
 If the mirror tells the truth 
 Then who the hell am I? 
 I scan the surface high and low 
 What arises from above 
 Everything I can't detect 
 Not a thing I will neglect 
 Countdown, I'm coming through 
 And the vengeance, and the taker 
 And the one, that shining sun 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 The rise of the machine 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 They rise up from their graves, to steal our dreams 
 I see the world in infrared 
 Hear the voices of the dead 
 I'm half man and half machine 
 The essence of your dream 
 Soon the judgment bell will toll 
 We'll take back everything they stole 
 I'm the judge, the hammer fall 
 Liberty and metal for all 
 Countdown, your time has come 
 And the vengeance, you're in danger 
 You're the one, let justice be done 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 The rise of the machine 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 They rise up from their graves, to steal our vivid dreams 
 In my heart there is always winter 
 Can not rest until I found the master key 
 The master key of trust 
 In my mind the arctic wind blows 
 Can not sleep I can not rest before the dawn brings back the light 
 Light of day 
 (Solo: Stefan) 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 The rise of the machine 
 Shadow Empire 
 Shadow Empire 
 They rise up from their graves, to steal our vivid dreamsThere I was completely wasting 
 Out of work and down 
 All inside it's so frustrating 
 As I drift from town to town 
 Feel as though nobody cares 
 If I live or die 
 So I might as well begin 
 To put some action in my life 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 So much for the golden future 
 I can't even start 
 I've had every promise broken 
 There's anger in my heart 
 You don't know what it's like 
 You don't have a clue 
 If you did you'd find yourselves 
 Doing the same thing too 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 You don't know what it's like 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the law 
 Breaking the law, breaking the lawOut in the fields 
 The full moon is rising 
 Enlightens the name on our shields 
 Blessed with pride 
 Steel on our side 
 We horsemen of thunder 
 The ground starts to shake as we ride 
 Side by side 
 Storm-bringer lead us into the unknown 
 On wings of glory we will carry on 
 Legacy of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS 
 Forever to survive, we're 
 Riding on the winds - riding on the winds 
 Unchained and free, alive forevermore 
 Deep in the night 
 We circle around them 
 The honor compels us to fight 
 All for one 
 All hewed with steel 
 In the toil of the battle 
 Our enemies fate will reveal 
 And be sealed 
 The chill of the wind keeps on calling our names 
 There's no turning back now, keep hold of the flame 
 Legacy of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS 
 Forever to survive, we're 
 Riding on the winds - riding on the winds 
 Unchained and free, alive forevermore 
 Now we are here 
 And there is nothing left to fear 
 The secrets of steel 
 The path of glory will reveal 
 Legacy of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS 
 Forever to survive, we're 
 Riding on the winds - riding on the winds 
 Unchained and free, alive forever 
 Legacy of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS 
 Forever to survive, we're 
 Riding on the winds - riding on the winds 
 Unchained and free, alive forevermore 
 Legacy of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGSThe gate is closed, the sky is burning 
 Dark clouds are closing in 
 A world at war, no revelation could help predict a mankind fall 
 Somewhere above, the unpolluted skies, we'll be resurrected 
 What have we done? We paid the highest price 
 No shelter for the undeserving masses 
 Standing in line for a final journey 
 Into space and beyond 
 A final sigh, a breath of hope we gather, heed the eternal call 
 Counting the stars, we pull the shortest straw, life is fading rapidly 
 Nothing remains, a withered devil's claw 
 Soul survivors picking up the pieces 
 Titan 
 Even the dark has a silver lining 
 Titan 
 Shining bright so far beyond the sun 
 So this is a new beginning 
 So far away, so far away 
 We leave the past behind us 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 Titan 
 Even the dark has a silver lining 
 Titan, Titan 
 Shining bright so far beyond the sun 
 Titan 
 Even the dark has a silver lining 
 Titan, Titan 
 Shining bright so far beyond the sun 
 We will fly 
 We're flying into space 
 Fly, fly away 
 We're flying into space6 am, we still rush along 
 The open road and we're feeling strong 
 Another town - HEY! - just lay it down, down to the ground 
 Only our way, or the highway straight to hell 
 Never give up, never give in 
 It's your life, make it right 
 Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now 
 Pedal to the metal - Life is Now 
 Our life is based on passion 
 And we live our lives the way we want 
 Hit the lights, time to bring it on 
 Ten thousand fists, they can not be wrong 
 We've come to slam - HEY! -the hammer down, never lose the game 
 Please come inside, do not be afraid, ain't no requiem 
 Never give up, never give in 
 Only one way so shout and scream 
 Never give up, never give in 
 Please take hold of your dream 
 Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now 
 Pedal to the metal - Life is Now 
 Our life is based on passion 
 And we live our lives the way we want 
 Our life is not a fashion 
 Pedal to the metal 
 Our life is based on passion 
 And we live our lives the way we want 
 Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now 
 Pedal to the metal - Life is Now 
 Our life is based on passion 
 And we live our lives the way we want 
 Never give up, ooh, never give in 
 This is your life, a thing you can't set asideLight up the candles and open the gate 
 The bell is ringing for the souls with no fate 
 Our little angels, all lost in this world 
 Death is transcending, they will resurrect 
 Not from their grave, but they've come to collect 
 In danza macabra, the dance of the dead 
 We honor the souls, we praise the departed 
 Now la calavera catrina is glowing 
 The eyes of the skull bursting into a blaze 
 All of the damned - dia de los muertos 
 All of the damned - los angelitos, los inocentes 
 So listen, beware, remember what they said 
 That life is best enjoyed after death 
 There is a place where the evil can rest 
 Let's draw a circle and take out their nest 
 Into the fire, we all been mislead 
 Battle is raging prepare to attack 
 Made out of fire they clobber my back 
 The living and dead in a final ballet 
 Let's summon the dead, 
 We all stand together 
 But we thought the spirits 
 Would rest on this day 
 How could we be so blind, 
 Stop the dance start the slay 
 All of the damned - dia de los muertos 
 All of the damned - los angelitos, los inocentes 
 So listen, beware, remember what they said 
 That life is best enjoyed after deathIn the distant maze, I see two doors 
 One leads to change, one leads to where I've been before 
 I am an angel, on broken wings 
 I am the beast, the devil and all in between 
 Nothing at all 
 It's never dark here, it's never light 
 Feeling like I'm caught between two worlds 
 Between two worlds 
 When the night comes down, the blade comes out 
 I wish, I wish, I wish I felt something at all 
 Nothing's wrong or right, nor black or white 
 Behind the hurt I see the lust come shining through 
 What do I do 
 Just like the rainbow, between mist and sun 
 Feeling like I'm trapped between two worlds 
 Between two worlds 
 (Solo: Oscar) 
 Never laugh or smile, I never try 
 My mind is numb, and I can't take it anymore 
 Screaming in frustration, no sound is heard 
 Am I asleep, or am I starring in a dream 
 Please wake me up 
 Sometimes the hunter, sometimes the prey 
 Feeling like I'm trapped, lost and never found 
 Feeling like I'm caught between two worlds 
 Without a homeI ...I am the one 
 The one ...who lost control 
 Control ...but in the end I'll be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who sold his soul 
 His soul ...forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing tall 
 Glorious, noble in my mind, everything a fight to win 
 Taking all and giving whatever my pride would let me 
 Not backing down, not giving in 
 I wouldn't lose, I couldn't 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who lost control 
 Control ...but in the end I'll be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who sold his soul 
 His soul ...forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing tall 
 I walk alone with my head held high, never felt that I belonged 
 Stand my ground at all costs running through life with blindfolds 
 Just for the right- right to be wrong 
 Nothing would rule my world but... 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who lost control 
 Control ...but in the end I'll be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who sold his soul 
 His soul ...forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing tall 
 Nothing would rule my world but...

 The one ...who lost control 
 Control ...but in the end I'll be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who sold his soul 
 His soul ...forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who lost control 
 Control ...but in the end I'd be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I ...I am the one 
 The one ...who sold his soul 
 His soul ...forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing tall 
 Seeing clearer what I've done 
 I'd refuse to let things go 
 I could never once admit I'm wrong 
 And what do I have to show? 
 Seeing clearer what's at stake 
 And the things I have to change 
 I just hope I can, it's not too late 
 To get a chance to end this painHe has all the power 
 Of darkness and night 
 Making you believe 
 That evil's all right 
 There's a fire in his eyes 
 He can make you burn 
 From the dead 
 He'll make you return 
 Sell your soul for gold 
 Do as you are told 
 Run with the devil 
 Don't come to me 
 Run with the devil 
 You can take me 
 Filling you with dreams 
 Promising the moon 
 Making you believe 
 You'll get there very soon 
 Offering you a life 
 Of glory and gold 
 It's really in you 
 To hell I know you're sold 
 Sell your soul for gold 
 Do as you are told 
 Run with the devil 
 Don't come to me 
 Run with the devil 
 You can take me 
 Take him to your heart 
 And you'll lose your soul 
 It's tearing you apart 
 Taking all control 
 Dreaming of a lie 
 All you get is fear 
 Agony and pain 
 Your end is very near 
 Sell your soul for gold 
 Do as you are told 
 Run with the devil 
 Don't come to me 
 Run with the devil 
 You can take meA battle with pride and ego. 
 A journey that started long ago. 
 Life time of passion and war.

 We have our hearts set in the past. 
 And eyes towards the future. 
 Rebel Inside. 
 The thunder 5 are riding once again. 
 Hell bent on blazing our own trail. 
 To seek out fortune and the fame. 
 We're warriors, warriors. 
 We're sick and tired of trying to explain. 
 That it's a life it's not a game. 
 The need to be will never wane. 
 We're warriors, warriors. 
 Rebel Inside, rebel for life. 
 Rebel Inside. 
 We'll never bend or bow we'll be 
 Always unbroken can't you see 
 We deal in steel and liberty. 
 We're immortalized, immortalized. 
 Realize it's not just how we are. 
 It's in our blood to seek the stars. 
 The crimson red will take us far. 
 We're immortalized, immortalized. 
 Rebel Inside, rebel for life.

 Ascending from the hearts who couldn't see 
 The decline of man, the final stage of war 
 Spectral forces of mankind 
 We're all trapped inside the core of the machine 
 Our time has come to find a way back home 
 We seek our destiny in thee 
 In the eye of the storm 
 A genesis is born, reborn 
 Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation 
 Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun 
 Phantom powers rule the earth 
 Descending down, controlling you and me 
 What is left to see, is it all but a dream 
 On the inside looking out 
 Kept within a cage, behind a false facade 
 They can't keep us down, our strength is our will 
 We dream of a genesis reborn 
 Where our spirits fly free 
 Let us choose our own destiny 
 Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation 
 Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun 
 Speak the word of Nemesis 
 Call for thunder call for rain 
 Let us meet our Genesis 
 Save us from the unholy pain 
 Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation 
 Riders of the storm - aligned with the sunLay down your arms this night 
 Surrender to the power 
 Embracing your metal heart 
 On your final walk through the snow 
 A hammer made of steel 
 From the river of blood 
 With magic, forged in flames 
 Delusions, a curse of the damned 
 What do you see? 
 Imaginary visions or reality 
 When you're free 
 Then you'll see that you are bound to rule 
 Rule, born, rule 
 We were born to rule 
 Rule, born, rule 
 We were born to rule 
 Born to rule, born to rule 
 We're born to rule forever more 
 Born to rule, born to rule 
 We're born to rule forever 
 The revolution forced us all to heed the final call 
 And if tomorrow never comes 
 Then we will strike the hammer down 
 Rule, born, rule 
 We were born to rule 
 Rule, born, rule 
 We were born to rule 
 Born to rule, born to rule 
 We're born to rule forever more 
 Born to rule, born to rule 
 We're born to rule forever 
 Forever, forever rule!Once upon a time not far away 
 We all swore the oath to seize the day 
 Moving on at the speed of light 
 Still united, undivided 
 We're brothers in arms searching for gold and glory 
 Stay true to your heart, come follow, heed the call 
 But nothing's forever, no nothing at all 
 Come inside, true templars of the world 
 Raise your voice, let's speak for the unheard 
 On and on the story must go on 
 Running free we always will be 
 We are what we are and we always strive for glory 
 Together as one we shine like the sun 
 Beyond the divine we're soaring 
 Shining on so glorious, the bloodline of true warriors 
 Fighting for the right to be; part of the legacy 
 Searching for the rainbow's end 
 The gold awaits for you my friend 
 Courage is your guiding star 
 And it will take you far

 And it will take you farSilence, we have sworn 
 The oath, protect the earth, the sun and moon

 We are true life defenders on earthOutcast a time of war, 
 When mankind lost control 
 Of life and death, under survaillance 
 I watch the children pray, 
 While God just turns away 
 Our in the ruins they seek shelter 
 These streets were once my home, 
 But those golden days are gone, 
 Now I'm fighting to survive 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, man or machine 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, the end of our dream 
 The word is on the street, 
 It's kill or to be killed 
 With no exception your are on your own 
 We should have seen it all along, 
 The writings on the wall, 
 Tell me what have we become 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, man or machine 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, the end of our dream 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, man or machine 
 Stone cold, Stone cold, the end of our... 
 Who do you believe in now, 
 When the prophecy came true the final deja vu 
 We should have seen it all along, 
 The writings on the wall, 
 Tell me what have we become 
 These streets were once my home, 
 But those golden days are gone, 
 Now I'm fighting to survive 
 Stone cold, man or machine 
 Stone cold, the end of our dreamAlways standing proud, we know our time has come

 In the name of metal, defending our hopes and believesThe dragon awakes the guardian waiting around 
 Once touched by fire, the flame kissed this dangerous ground 
 Cause by lust the creature slaughtered human race 
 Once defended to become a state of grace 
 We are the Crusaders 
 Blood-red cross caretakers 
 Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker 
 In the Dark Ages when mankind gave birth to the beast 
 The demons and wizards united rejected priest 
 All invoked the power of king Lucifer 
 To infuse the power from the crucifer 
 We are the Crusaders 
 Blood-red cross caretakers 
 Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker 
 Out of the ashes they summoned the brave to fight back 
 To bring the evil down the best way was sold attack 
 To avoid repeating history once more 
 We must slay the dragon burn his guts and gore 
 We are the Crusaders 
 Blood-red cross caretakers 
 Allied as one, mighty storm 
 Call out the defender 
 Return the beast to sender 
 Hail to the king, known as StormbreakerSilent screaming, 
 You're on your own 
 Balancing on a blade between 
 What's right and what is wrong

 The wisdom, the voice is calling from inside 
 The time long forgotten will soon come again 
 Prepare for the meeting, the gods of metal reignMy guard is down, accept my invitation 
 But don't waste my time, with your slander'n lies 
 Cause my dream, is my dream 
 All based on my revelations 
 Extreme, but not mean 
 And I'll stand the test of time 
 You say you like me, you're my friend, 
 But I got stabbed in the back 
 Removed that smile and wash the blood off your hands 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 You call my name but you don't know me 
 You say I'm insane but who's to blame 
 'Cause I'll scream and I'll scream 
 And I'm building up a reputation 
 I esteem by all means 
 'Cause I swin against the stream 
 You turn the page and write 
 The story of a life you don't know 
 My tongue is sharp and mightier than your pen 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 Refuse to be something that I'm not 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 I Refuse, I Refuse 
 Refuse to be something that I'm notDo you remember how we used to say 
 Everything around us is made of clay 
 We were the Kings and the others the fools, 
 Playing by our rules 
 Adorned with golden shapes and silver dreams 
 You count the seconds, every moment seems 
 Like your lost to the stars up above 
 Even though you're falling 
 Spoken words made of trust, burning bridges between us, 
 Turning diamonds into rust 
 You're running out of time, the higher that you climb 
 The deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all 
 Out of time, on the line 
 Living In Victory 
 You spread your words, I say devoid of truth 
 What's left is fantasy of endless youth 
 You made a promise, a little white lie 
 Now you're falling from the sky 
 Chasing dragons by the moon, burning bridges around you, 
 Your deepest fears begin to loom 
 You're running out of time, the higher that you climb 
 The deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all 
 Out of time, on the line 
 Living In Victory 
 Is it someone that hears you, is it somebody there 
 All you know and all you will get, lie so deep down inside 
 Dreams of fortune in the dust, when all your bridges are burnt, 
 Turning being into lust 
 You're running out of time, the higher that you climb 
 The deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all 
 Out of time, on the line 
 Living in sin 
 Out of time, the higher that you climb 
 The deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all 
 Out of time, on the line 
 Living In Victory 
 Living In VictoryGaze upon the stake, 
 Flames will soon start to embrace 
 Condemned, auto da fé, 
 She's about to fall from grace 
 In the land of the rising sun 
 Shadows are falling again 
 The die is cast, the future and past 
 Coming to her at last 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 All she needed was a Champion 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Crying for a saviour to fight for her life 
 Behold, the freedom cries 
 By the dying of the light 
 Too late to justify 
 For vindication upon this night 
 In the land of the rising sun 
 Shadows are falling again 
 From out of nowhere, a rider declared 
 To answer her final prayer 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He stood up to be the Champion 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He became the saviour that fought for her life 
 Face to face, eye to eye 
 The saviour fought to save her pride 
 Far beyond the starlit skies, the encounter went on 
 Gaze upon the stake, 
 As the flames start to embrace 
 A life, an act of faith, 
 Long-lost gone without a trace 
 In the land of the rising sun 
 Shadows are falling again 
 The die is cast for the future and past 
 Came for her at last 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 All she needed was a Champion 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Crying for a saviour to fight for her 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He stood up to be the Champion 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 He became the saviour that fought for her lifeHeed the war cry for glory 
 Hear them calling your name 
 Hold your ground, show no mercy 
 For freedom in anger, now maim 
 Another angel is dying - Falling 
 His entry to heaven denied - Falling from the skies 
 Predestined to walk and fend in the darkness - Fortune 
 Reveal the gates of hell - Hex, Immortalized 
 The fallen, they walk all among us - Angels 
 Their broken wings will not bear - Angels in disguise 
 Eternal dawn, in torment anguish - Dawning 
 Bound to stagger this land - Hex, Immortal 
 We walk the line, we stand alone, eternally 
 We're crused to live, we cannot die 
 Immortalized 
 Time goes by, now the angels 
 Feed the eternal flame 
 Stand your ground, cursed immortal 
 The hex is now stuck to your name.You've been fighting for much to long 
 You saw the future and what to come 
 Restless spirits out on the run, 
 Among the shadows of the sun 
 You are the rising resistance now 
 We've come to show you a way somehow 
 Beyond the past and in secrecy, 
 We found it all, but we want more 
 We come from the age of chivalry 
 Metal machines, unchained and free 
 We are here for you to see 
 Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are breaking the seal 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the word of a Legend Reborn 
 Moving silent like a gentle breeze 
 The troops of metal and we do as we please 
 We are the restless, we are the vile, 
 Burning hearts that never die 
 We are going against the tide 
 The hammer has fallen, a thorn in your side 
 Break the silence or take the fall 
 The mighty Templars will take it all 
 Welcome the age of chivalry, 
 Were we all will be set free 
 It's the time for you and me 
 Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are breaking the seal 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the word of a Legend Reborn 
 Sons and brothers fight or fall 
 With our sisters and daughters 
 We're standing one for all 
 Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are breaking the seal 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the word of a Legend Reborn 
 Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are breaking the seal 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the word of a Legend RebornWhen the sky is turning black, you fear the dawn 
 Your inner voice compels you, but you're all alone 
 Thy secret sense lies still obscure within your shattered dreams, 
 And all you can do is scream 
 Long ago you spoke the words of heresy 
 Twenty years of running brings back memories 
 All your wisdom made me seek the truth that lied beyond 
 My inner dreams 
 Follow the one that fell from the crimson skies 
 I remember the words, I can never forget your demise 
 And now your world's falling down 
 For all the games that you played 
 And as your soul's falling down 
 You'll meet The Unforgiving Blade 
 Should have seen it coming 
 When you rolled the dice 
 Deeper and deeper, falling, 
 Away from your paradise 
 Solo: Stefan 
 Innocent eyes observing the Crimson Skies, 
 Awaiting for someone to heal the burning lies 
 And now your world's falling down 
 For all the games that you played 
 And as your soul's falling down 
 You'll meet The Unforgiving Blade 
 And now your world's falling down 
 For all the games that you played 
 And as your soul's falling down 
 You'll meet The Unforgiving Blade 
 And now your world's falling down 
 For all the games that you played

 Whoa, yeah

 (We are the youth gone wild)

 "Get a three-piece Wall Street smile, and son, you'll look just like me" 
 I said, "Hey man, there's somethin' you oughta know

 Well, I look and see it's not only me 
 We're standing tall, ain't never a doubt

 They call us problem child 
 We spend our lives on trial 
 We walk an endless mile

 When all the steel begins to glow 
 The fire is burning 
 It keeps the cauldron boiling slow 
 Ashes to ashes 
 We'll make 'em crawl to dust 
 The dragon will forge the steel 
 In fire never-ever rust 
 No angels will come down 
 To hold this sacred ground 
 The anvil starts to glow 
 Hammer down! 
 Made of steel - Raise your swords to the sky 
 Charge! In battle - Dethrone and Defy 
 Blessed by Nefarious 
 It'll make 'em yield, will make 'em kneel 
 Wizards of fire 
 Will cast their spells upon their steel 
 Striking the anvil hard 
 No rest from the hammers violent blow 
 We are the power 
 And you are welcome to our show 
 Dark angels falling down 
 We're waiting on the ground 
 The anvil starts to glow 
 Hammer down 
 Made of steel - Raise your swords to the sky 
 Charge! In battle - Dethrone and Defy 
 So, bring it on 
 Fighting all for one 
 Tap the hammer, keep the solid pace 
 Oh, oh, oh... 
 Made of steel - Raise your swords to the sky 
 Charge! In battle - Dethrone and Defy 
 Made of steel - Raise your swords to the sky 
 Charge united - Dethrone and DefyLast night I had a vivid dream, 
 I found a place where nothing's what it seems, 
 I'm bound to walk this earth alone, 
 I am a hunter and the heir to the throne, 
 The chase of blood and sweet revenge, 
 It keeps on hammering in my head, 
 The urge to kill is getting stronger, 
 I'm south of heaven, north of hell, 
 My final place to dwell, 
 Surrender your soul, 
 Surrender your pride, 
 Please enter my dream, 
 Find your natural high, 
 Have nothing to fear, 
 Cause your rebirth is near, 
 The bat awakens deep inside, 
 No where to run for my eternal bride, 
 And when the darkness comes around, 
 I come alive, cause for your sweet blood I am bound, 
 I taste your blood so bitter sweet, 
 Come ease my pain get on your knees, 
 You know true love is meant to be, 
 Forever is now what it seems, 
 This is your final scream, 
 Surrender your soul, 
 Surrender your pride, 
 Please enter my dream, 
 Find your natural high, 
 Got nothing to fear, 
 Cause your rebirth is near, 
 So you are born again, 
 On a far higher plane, 
 In my dark neverland you're part of the game, 
 Forever we are, forever we'll be, 
 We're forever free, 
 (Solo: Stephan) 
 (Solo: Oscar) 
 Surrender your soul, 
 Surrender your pride, 
 Please enter my dream, 
 Find your natural high, 
 Have nothing to fear, 
 Cause your rebirth is near,Hear the screams from down below 
 The cry of the raven, the demons and wizards 
 In league with the dark 
 Feed the fire nourish the flames 
 The hammer is pounding the steel in its grace 
 By via crucis, embraced 
 Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost 
 Ordeal of ingestion, the way of the cross 
 Oh it's... 
 Tainted metal 
 Tainted metal 
 No return nowhere to go 
 The wands of the wizards call demons to fetter 
 Their heart broken souls 
 Face the fire, defiling the steel 
 The blood of the heathens, their guts and their gore 
 Weakens the sword to the core 
 Born out of wedlock, the future came fast 
 Trial by fire, iconoclast 
 Oh it's... 
 Tainted metal 
 Tainted metal 
 Oh it's... 
 Tainted metal 
 Tainted metal 
 Blackens the power of steel 
 Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost 
 Ordeal of ingestion, ordeal of the cross 
 Oh it's... 
 Tainted metal 
 Tainted metal 
 Oh it's... 
 Tainted metal 
 Tainted metal 
 Blackens the power of steel 
 Oh...

 The king rejected his crown 
 All blasphemers stood in line 
 To spread their gospel and lies 
 But a wind of change came in from the past 
 The legendary...

 Dethroned, imprisoned in chains 
 Duel the black horse, the Swordsmen must kneel 
 Condemned to serve within the shadows 
 Put'em next to their King 
 Out of the fire and into the night 
 A handful of brave men appeared 
 Crimson thunder running through their veins 
 A bond that will last forever 
 Nothing's stronger than ... 
 Brothers in arms are fighting tonight 
 The Forces of steel meet again 
 Born in the fire, they look to the sky 
 Power of metal unchained 
 Time has come, break out of these chains 
 FIGHT! proud for your kingdom 
 Behind the defenders the king marches on 
 By divine intervention 
 They are fighting with ... 
 Brothers in arms are fighting tonight 
 The Forces of Steel live again 
 Born in the fire, they look to the sky 
 The power of metal unchained 
 Past many nights they fought on 
 And by the moonlight the battle was won 
 But still the black horse is running 
 Knowing were the power will lead 
 Brothers in arms are fighting tonight 
 The Forces of Steel live again 
 Born in the fire, they look to the sky 
 The power of metal unchainedThe moon is full, you cannot see 
 There's something in the air 
 Sound asleep, you're in too deep 
 Protecting your own lair 
 The lion roar into the night 
 Yet another foe to slay 
 Who are you that I see right through? 
 The hunter or the prey? 
 Too late to hear the final warning 
 No one can defy the reaper 
 Voices - twisted 
 Calling out your name

 Calling for you 
 Ain't no reason for the rhyme 
 Take the black, ready to attack 
 Take the black 
 Face to face, you bide your time 
 Take the black, ready to attack 
 Take the black 
 You, though you had it all in there 
 In your little bag of tricks 
 Insanity won't set you free 
 As you cross the river Styx 
 You're out of time, your bridges burn 
 In the undying flame 
 We'll nail you down to the ground 
 For you to bear the shame 
 Too late to hear the final warning 
 No one can defy the reaper 
 Voices - twisted

 In the land of no return 
 To seek out the danger, time to burn 
 They are the rightous ones 
 They've come to claim this land 
 Like warriors under command 
 They fight for gold and glory 
 Proclaim the dead man's land 
 Into the dungeons they must go 
 To find the answers, left untold 
 Under the burning sun 
 In danger, eye to eye 
 They all now that someone must die 
 Into the well they're falling 
 Past immortality 
 Led by temptation and devotion 
 Rendered deathless by the touch of the sword 
 Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry 
 The enemies, will renounce or die 
 Hail the Warriors Of Faith 
 Together they march through the fire 
 Forever they're lost in this world 
 Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry 
 The enemies, will renounce or die 
 Eternally, they will fall under the sign 
 Of victory, fighting all for one 
 Hail the the Warriors Of FaithI'm a wheel, I'm a wheel 
 I can roll, I can feel 
 And you can't stop me turning 
 'Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sun 
 I can move, I can run 
 But you'll never stop me burning 
 Come down with fire 
 And lift my spirit higher 
 Someone's screaming my name 
 Come and make me holy again 
 I'm the man on the silver mountain 
 I'm the man on the silver mountain 
 I'm the day, I'm the day 
 I can show you the way 
 And look, I'm right beside you 
 I'm the night, I'm the night 
 I'm the dark and the light 
 With eyes that see inside you 
 Come down with fire 
 And lift my spirit higher 
 Someone's screaming my name 
 Come and make me holy again

 Coming down with fire 
 I'll lift your spirit higher 
 I'm the man on the mountain 
 The man on the silver mountain 
 I'm the night, the light 
 The black and the white 
 The man on the silver mountain 
 I'm the man on the silver mountainThe war still remains 
 No Kingdom on earth 
 There's only pure evil, indifference to birth 
 In the tombs of the dead 
 One man breeds alone 
 The unearthly warfare shadows the throne 
 Three temptations written down 
 The Lust of flesh, lust of the eye 
 Finally the pride of life 
 The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds 
 My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one 
 To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss 
 My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death 
 Possessing his soul 
 The curse of the damned 
 A tormented victim, to the bottom he's slammed 
 One man stands alone 
 Trapped, under a spell 
 Encounter your demons, send them to Hell 
 No temptations left to fend 
 Sanctified, Anti Christ 
 Casting shadows towards the cross 
 The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds 
 My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one 
 To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss 
 My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death 
 The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds 
 My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one 
 To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss 
 My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and deathWe'll make it 
 Been fighting for so long don't know which way up is 
 Been stuck and ripped and burnt till it feels like nothin' 
 Our time will come and when it's over and it's done 
 Those fools are gonna know that we ain't bluffin' 
 We're gonna make it 
 We'll reach the top 
 We're gonna make it 
 And then we're never gonna stop 
 The power of the people ain't been showin' 
 It's never what you know, it's who you're knowin' 
 Sure it ain't right but as the saying goes it's might 
 That decides who stays behind and who'll be goin' 
 Solo - Jay Jay 
 All right, all right, we're gonna make it 
 Come on, boys, come on, boys 
 Ain't gonna stop until we drop 
 Oh, oh 
 Let it rock, let it roll 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
 Here we go, babyArose from the ashes, the remains of a time set aside 
 The warrior of Eden, found by honor, these two words collide 
 On and on and on, with glory he came, he saw, he conquered 
 He gathered his armies, true he leads across the Templars of steel 
 They sought out the dragon, made the enemy bleed, made them kneel 
 On and on and on, a legend unbent, unbowed, unbroken 
 On and on and on, a story is born, a legacy reborn! 
 Hammer high to the sky 
 Follow the warrior and king 
 Call of Hector's Hymn 
 Hammer high (Hammer high), amplify 
 Hail to the warrior! 
 Call of Hector's Hymn 
 Along came the thunder and the hero was set to return 
 We haunt you by fire, our spirit is now set to burn 
 On and on and on, the fire and the flame will burn forever 
 Still guarded by Templars, all the secrets of steel will remain 
 'Cause we are the keepers, and for us this is real not a game 
 On and on and on, we follow this need, we came, we conquered 
 On and on and on, together we fight, together we will fall 
 Hammer high to the sky

 Hail to the warrior! 
 Call of Hector's 
 Call of Hector's HymnIn a time of fear and confusion, 
 Silence charging the air 
 The sunlight is gone, darkness lives on 
 In the heart of the dragon's lair 
 Lost in a world of illusions 
 No trace of the missing ore 
 Stealing our souls, we're out of control, 
 Knocking at death's door 
 All our beliefs fading into ashes 
 Heed the words that we pray 
 For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn 
 Now we charge, the battle is raging, 
 Blood runs everywhere 
 Our anger is fierce, avenging the years 
 No time for a final prayer 
 Behold, the might of the hammer, 
 Elliptical bolts of fire 
 There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
 You're down to the wire 
 Somewhere out there lies a new tomorrow 
 For me and those who believe 
 For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn 
 For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn 
 Ooh, Ooh, Ooh... 
 Now, I've returned from a place far beyond 
 My mission I set, let it be done 
 We still believe in a brighter future 
 The dreams are ours to fulfill 
 For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn 
 For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer, let the infidels burnIt's getting closer now 
 The clock strikes midnight time 
 It is the tolling of the judgment bell 
 You fear the dead of night 
 There ain't no place to hide 
 This is your point of no return 
 Now we are ready to strike, again 
 It's getting far too late, my friend 
 Let The Hammer Fall 
 We are above the law 
 Let our power show 
 That we're in full control of your destiny 
 Now we are ready to strike, again 
 It's getting far too late, my friend 
 Let The Hammer Fall 
 Oh, oh, oh... 
 We're getting closer now 
 The chill of distant eyes 
 Your on a dead end street into the night 
 Now we are ready to strike, again 
 It's getting far too late, my friend 
 Let The Hammer Fall 
 Let the Hammer FallRide 
 They came at dawn 
 Into the morning light 
 Black shadows ridin' on the mist 
 Prepared for battle 
 Swords were shinin' bright 
 Filled with anger and harm 
 Came to kill not to charm 
 The sound of metal 
 Screamin' in the air 
 The time has come where justice rules 
 The endless victims 
 Looking up in fear 
 Now who were the fools 
 Oh here they come 
 Riders of the sun 
 And they will fight 
 Back to back - back to back 
 They're fighting hard 
 Their way of victory 
 Dead bodies lying on the ground 
 They are the soldiers of eternity 
 And their swords spinnin' around 
 They're fightin' with power, ready to ride let go 
 They got it all 
 They'll never fall 
 But they will fight 
 The night is fallin' 
 Light will disappear 
 A magic silence fills the place 
 Could read the warning 
 Shinin' crystal clear 
 Now they were lost for the chase 
 No - no - no - noCountdown, descending down to zero 
 Bursting into flames 
 Can't you see the coming of a hero 
 On this enchanting day 
 So stand up and be counted 
 In the solar glance, in the desert sand 
 No longer the hunted 
 United we are till the day we fall 
 A chain unbreakable 
 Every link is allied to our mighty vow 
 We're blood bound, we aim for the sun 
 The luminous moon will take us high over ground 
 We're blood bound, collecting the stars 
 We hold a power that is greater than all 
 We're blood bound 
 Watch out, the heathens all around us 
 Always watch your back 
 We've got a lust for freedom 
 Whatever they say, we know we'll stay 
 We are indestructible 
 And no matter what happens, we will rise above 
 We're blood bound, we aim for the sun 
 The luminous moon will take us high over ground 
 We're blood bound, collecting the stars 
 We hold a power that is greater than all 
 We're blood bound 
 Look into my eyes 
 Tell me what is hidden deep inside 
 Chains about to break 
 It's the everlasting freedom for us all 
 We're blood bound, we aim for the sun 
 The luminous moon will take us high over ground 
 We're blood bound, collecting the stars 
 We hold a power together 
 We're blood bound, we aim for the sun 
 The luminous moon will take us high over ground 
 We're blood bound, collecting the stars 
 We hold a power together (blood bound) 
 Power forever (blood bound), power 
 We're blood boundA flash in the night, a journey through time 
 The Templars are back on the streets 
 Guarded by prowess and the will to survive 
 All led by the guiding light 
 Angels of mercy, guardians of time 
 Shackled and chained through the eternal flame 
 The hammer will slowly arise 
 Heeding the call, one and for all 
 Never surrender, with glory we'll fall 
 Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight 
 Fulfilling our fate, we are 
 Heeding the call 
 One step ahead, revealing the past 
 United, together we stand 
 The call of the thunder, the sign to begin 
 This final crusade we will win 
 Angels of mercy, our journey must proceed 
 With hearts all filled up with chivalry 
 The lifeblood that we all need 
 Heeding the call, one and for all 
 Never surrender, with glory we'll fall 
 Brothers unite, let stand up and fight 
 Fulfilling our fate, we are heeding the call 
 Oh, oh, oh...

 Never surrender, with glory we'll fall 
 Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight 
 Fulfilling our fate, we are heeding the callSee the light of those who find 
 As time pass you by, you're still left behind 
 Time has come for you to see

 The ivory gates cast shadows, might betray 
 Surrender this night, or choose my way 
 Come with me, I'll take you there 
 To the land of make believe 
 Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie 
 On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty 
 With the power of the steel

 You have to spell out what's wrong or right

 As real as it gets, we are soldiers of one-man armies 
 Burning inside, hear the audience scream 
 We've got a yearning inside to fulfill our destiny

 The crowd goes wild, music to our ears 
 Get it on

 No fearless warrior could subdue the beast 
 No gallant man around could stand and hold his ground 
 Days passed by and weeks turned into years 
 Every drip of hope became a sea of fears 
 Somewhere in the dark, a light or just a spark 
 Brothers in arms fighting one for all 
 Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind 
 No turning back, brothers fight or fall 
 Standing together, we fight, one of a kind 
 Years of darkness all torn by fate's hand 
 A nation cursed, once glorious and grand 
 From the ashes we will rise, like a phoenix to the skies 
 Brothers in arms fighting one for all 
 Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind 
 No turning back, brothers fight or fall 
 Standing together, we fight, one of a kind 
 Come take my hand, don't leave me here all alone 
 Come make a stand, don't let us all fade away, fade away 
 1666 - we stood in the valley of death 
 Steel in our hands, the final command 
 To cure and to heal our nation 
 Mighty warriors - mount up don't stare at the ground 
 Hold your heads high, resist and defy 
 Fighting, defending, we're screaming, avenging you all 
 We're standing all for one for all 
 One voice we're one of a kind, we are 
 Never look back, never surrender 
 We're fighting all for one for all 
 One heart, we're one of a kind, we are 
 'Cause we are here and we are fighting

 Like the calm before the storm 
 You hear me, I'm everywhere 
 In the wind and in the rain 
 Feel me in every breeze 
 I'm the chill inside your spine 
 I'm burning, you start to freeze 
 As you slowly turn around 
 And down in your hole 
 Solitary darkness rule 
 You are forlorn 
 'Cause justice will be mine 
 Prowling the night 
 Justice calling, we'll track you down 
 Justice calling, ready to strike 
 Justice calling, breaking the chains 
 Hammer of justice seeking his revenge 
 Dead man. walking by 
 There's a void inside his eyes 
 Judgement, a final sigh 
 Hear the screams electrified 
 As the mirror turns blank 
 And your essence fades away 
 Your chapter's closed 
 Sealed with thunderbolts 
 Prowling the night 
 Justice calling, we'll track you down 
 Justice calling, ready to strike 
 Justice calling, breaking the chains 
 Strike with the hammer of justice 
 Justice calling, we'll track you down 
 Justice calling, ready to strike 
 Justice calling, breaking the chains 
 Hammer of justice seeking his revenge 
 I see injustice everywhere I go 
 I search for tomorrow and I know you will be there 
 The hammer of justice holds the key to the future 
 The bringer of sorrow is the last you'll see 
 Justice calling, we'll track you down 
 Justice calling, ready to strike 
 Justice calling, breaking the chains 
 Strike with the hammer of justice 
 Justice calling, we'll track you down 
 Justice calling, ready to strike 
 Justice calling, breaking the chains 
 Hammer of justice seeking his revenge 
 Justice callingIs it too late to go in peace, I wonder how 
 How these things did start anyway 
 Maybe too late to find a way, when the 
 Trail of grief is marked with memories 
 Now when you're gone, the warmth 
 Of the sun seems so faraway 
 I believe - in everything I see, every 
 Second is a miracle for me 
 I believe - after sunshine comes the 
 Rain, and when it's pouring down 
 The only thing I feel is pain 
 I walk alone through shapeless dreams 
 My only home is the wasteland that I cross 
 I close the door and turn the key 
 Those days of joy are barely memories 
 Now when you're gone, your star will 
 Shine on, won't you shine for me 
 I believe - in everything I see, every 
 Second is a miracle for me 
 I believe - after sunshine comes the 
 Rain, and when it's pouring down 
 The only thing I feel is painSomewhere in the alley 
 A shot inside the dark 
 The gutters paved in blackened blood 
 By the godless patriarch 
 You hear the thunder howlin' 
 You fear his glowing eyes 
 A bang across the universe 
 As the lightning hits the skies 
 Fear the sound of metal 
 The clash when steel meets steel 
 We're renegades, let's regulate 
 Let's finish this ordeal 
 We are defenders, the almighty 
 We stomp the trail where no one dares to go 
 We are the brave, let's keep on fighting 
 Protect the sacred vow 
 Trapped into a corner 
 Silence fills the air 
 The dark abandoned city streets 
 Is now the dragon's lair 
 A scream across the heavens 
 A sound to heed the call 
 Protectors of the universe 
 Ready to play ball 
 Fear the sound of metal 
 The sweetest sound of all 
 We're flying high up in the sky 
 A mighty fireball 
 We are defenders, the almighty 
 We stomp the trail where no one dares to go 
 We are the brave, let's keep on fighting 
 Protect the sacred vow 
 The first cut spilled blood in the gutter 
 The second cut blinded his eyes 
 The third cut gave us all the answers 
 The final cut sliced up his lies 
 We are defenders, the almighty 
 We stomp the trail where no one dares to go 
 We are the brave, let's keep on fighting 
 Protect the sacred vow 
 We are defenders, the almighty 
 We stomp the trail where no one dares to go 
 We are the brave, let's keep on fighting 
 Protect the sacred vowStanding at the 
 Crossroads, were the future meets the past 
 Oh can't you feel, there's magic in the air 
 We're noble knights and mighty men, with the 
 Power to assay 
 Faithful and true, let our deeds show you the way 
 Glorious, we live and we die 
 Our courage will unite 
 In our hands we hold the future, carry on 
 In our hearts, eternally, we Keep The Flame 
 Burning 
 Hear the sound of roaring thunder, and the 
 Sound of raging steel 
 In the battle of thrust our sprits will reveal 
 Glorious, we'd rather die 
 With honour than to live with shame 
 In our hands we hold the future, carry on 
 In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame... 
 Burning deep inside forever, shining on 
 And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The 
 Flame Burning 
 We stay as we are, now the first crusade is won 
 Let it be written, let it be done 
 In our hands we hold the future, carry on 
 In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame... 
 Burning deep inside forever, shining on 
 And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The 
 Flame BurningIcy water on my hands 
 The roar of thunder everywhere 
 I close my eyes, I realize 
 I'm far away from home 
 In the Twilight Zone, the shadows mourn 
 Out of the night came the shining ... 
 The Metal Age 
 Ivory towers conceal my eyes 
 Caught up in a long lost time 
 Where no one speaks, at liberty, 
 They guard their destiny 
 To forge the steel, they will reveal 
 Out of the night came the shining ... 
 The Metal Age 
 I'm falling into the breach 
 I'm a stranger in this land, I'm falling 
 Standing strong, the brave and the elder 
 With scars seldom forgotten, above it all 
 Come with us, offering shelter 
 From the icy wind that shiver 
 Come with us to the twilight zone, oh yeah 
 You're welcome to the Metal Age 
 Hear the bell begin to chime 
 The moonlit skies burst out in flames 
 The time has come, it must be done, 
 Let the power be unchained 
 By the force within, let the war begin 
 Out of the night came the shining ... 
 The Metal AgeWe saw the writings on the wall 
 When heathens ruled above us all 
 Tormented, we still heard the call 
 You come to bring us down 
 Wield the scepter, steal the crown 
 Time on the throne is running out 
 'Cause seasons change, but we are still the same 
 Even though the cold winds blow, the fire burns inside 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Burning for the steel 
 Hearts on fire 
 For years, shunned by society 
 Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs 
 Our legions grew in secrecy 
 And now, the time is here 
 I see the Templars everywhere 
 The freedom call is drawing near 
 We hold our rebel banners up with pride 
 The colour's crimson and the hammer is the sign 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire 
 Burning for the steel 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire... 
 Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
 Burning, burning with desire...Jag blev fångad i mörker, jag såg inget ljus 
 Fast allt runt omkring stod i brand 
 I lågornas sken fanns mitt hopp och min tro 
 Som virvlade bort och försvann 
 Så ge mig min styrka, ge mig kraft att försvara mitt land 
 Ge mig en väg att gå, jag ser yxan i krigarens hand 
 Vill ni att jag vänder om och slåss för den jag är? 
 Aldrig sviker jag mitt land 
 När vindarna viskar mitt namn 
 Mitt namn 
 Och regnet som föll det fick dölja min sorg 
 Och släcka min brinnande törst 
 Jag flydde till bergen när gryningen kom 
 Och plötsligt jag hörde en röst 
 Vindarna viskar, jag hör hur dom kallar mitt namn 
 Jag har en väg att gå, jag ser yxan i krigarens hand 
 Vill ni att jag vänder om och slåss för den jag är? 
 Aldrig sviker jag mitt land 
 När vindarna viskar mitt namn 
 Mitt namn 
 Så ge mig min styrka, ge mig kraft att försvara mitt land 
 Ge mig en väg att gå, jag ser yxan i krigarens hand 
 Vill ni att jag vänder om och slåss för den jag är? 
 Aldrig sviker jag mitt land 
 När vindarna viskar mitt namn 
 Vindarna viskar mitt namnI won't pull the trigger 
 Just to see you die 
 No remedy to make me come alive 
 I'm ticking like a timebomb 
 (Need) no fuse, just guts and gore 
 (To) initiate the burning of the core 
 I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole 
 No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul 
 Kill by any means necessary 
 Win by any means necessary 
 Live by any means necessary 
 Die by any means necessary 
 I am not judgemental 
 A sinner nor a saint 
 'Cause either you're my best friend or you ain't 
 Come gather here around me 
 Feel my breath under your skin 
 I'm deadly, only when I'm getting caught 
 I count down to zero, I'm a soldier without soul 
 No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul 
 Kill by any means necessary 
 Win by any means necessary 
 Live by any means necessary 
 Die by any means necessary 
 I am born to kill - judge and condemn 
 I am born to win - slay and maim 'em 
 I am born to live - fight for glory 
 I am born to die 
 Kill - win - live - die 
 Kill by any means necessary 
 Win by any means necessary 
 Live by any means necessary 
 Die by any means necessary 
 I am born to kill - judge and condemn 
 I am born to win - slay and maim 'em 
 I am born to live - fight for glory 
 I am born to die - memento mori 
 I am born to kill - judge and condemn 
 I am born to win - slay and maim 'em 
 I am born to live - fight for glory 
 I am born to die - memento mori...As I wake up from my slumber 
 From a deep, enchanted sleep 
 There's a pain, there's a mark 
 There's a wound 
 The trail of blood is running deep 
 There's an echo in the mirror 
 Of a man I do not know 
 Staring back at the scar 
 On my neck 
 And the numbers are 
 Screaming... 
 Six, Six, Six 
 Grab the holy crucifix 
 Skies turned red 
 High above the river Styx 
 Kneeling down in desperation 
 As I start to speak in tongues 
 When I praise the 
 Old man down below 
 I recite the mantra 
 Six, Six, Six 
 Twist the holy crucifix 
 Grab the oars 
 Scull across the river Styx 
 It's the evil in me 
 The Enemy Within my soul 
 The subjagtor 
 Six, Six, Six 
 Get the holy crucifix 
 Throw it in 
 Into Acheron or Styx 
 Six, Six, Six 
 Sinking like a ton of bricks 
 One-way pass 
 Over Acheron and Styx 
 It's the evil in me 
 The Enemy Within my soul 
 The subjagtorHoo, my little pretty one, my pretty one 
 When you gonna give me some time, Sharona? 
 Hoo, you make my motor run, my motor run

 Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona

 When you gonna give to me, g-give to me 
 Is it just a matter of time, Sharona? 
 Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny 
 Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona? 
 Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind 
 I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind 
 My, my, my, aye-aye, woo!

 Hoooooo-ohhh, my Sharona 
 Hoooooo-ohhh, my Sharona 
 Hoooooo-ohhh, my SharonaCan you tell me why 
 It seems so hard to carry on 
 When you hear a voice 
 From long ago, so bittersweet 
 Even though I try, I can not 
 Read between the lines 
 You know I tried, 
 Oh, yes, I tried, what's wrong 
 Too late to turn back time 
 To look over my shoulder 
 Maybe one day I'll return again 
 Remember Yesterday 
 And think about tomorrow 
 But you have to live today 
 Oh, lonely yesterday 
 Don't leave me with the sorrow 
 'Cause I have to live today 
 Every morning I awake 
 To see the newborn day 
 To carry on the flame 
 Until the end of time 
 Too late to turn back time 
 To look over my shoulder 
 Maybe one day I'll return again 
 Remember Yesterday 
 And think about tomorrow 
 But you have to live today 
 Oh, lonely yesterday 
 Don't leave me with the sorrow 
 'Cause I have to live today 
 Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside 
 And pretend about the future 
 Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie 
 Don't you know tomorrow never comes 
 Remember Yesterday 
 And think about tomorrow 
 But you have to live today 
 Oh, lonely yesterday 
 Don't leave me with the sorrow 
 'Cause I have to live today 
 Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside 
 And pretend about the future 
 Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie 
 Don't you know tomorrow never comesYour words of slander won't take us down 
 We see right through you a shattered clown 
 We walk the walk and we talk the talk 
 We'll back it up if you wanna rock 
 Wanna rock 
 We'll give you action to back these words 
 We'll write the songs that are still unheard 
 And at the down of the new crusade 
 You're at a standstill beneath the blade 
 No matter what they'll say 
 Forever we march our own way 
 We're in this together; we're fighting to win 
 For better or worse by the virtue of sin 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 You cast your spell with a serpent's tongue 
 Through rage and fire, you walk among 
 Your tainted magic we see right through 
 Time to retreat, from our point of view 
 Come join our mighty parade 
 The future is ours to invade 
 'Cause you heard the warnings, the reason, our cause 
 G.Y.D.U. this is our call to arms 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Time to step down from your throne 
 Free of sin? Please cast the first stone 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Bring It - Just Bring It 
 Just Bring ItCharge into the vein 
 Like a needle for the pain 
 Thunderbolts clashing down 
 A new sound across the land 
 Force we are the pawns 
 Conveying a new dawn 
 Hear the screams, feel the force 
 In a symphony of steel 
 Across the universe 
 Embracing all mankind 
 There's something in our hearts worth fighting for 
 Some Secrets better left untold 
 And when the time has come for us to die 
 We'll take the Secrets to the grave 
 No, here they stand 
 The resistance, hand in hand 
 When you think we are gone 
 We will rise a brand new dawn 
 Across the universe 
 Embracing all mankind 
 There's something in our hearts worth fighting for 
 Some Secrets better left untold 
 And when the time has come for us to die 
 We'll take the Secrets to the grave 
 Charge, hear the screams 
 It's the fear of the unseen 
 Force, no remorse 
 It's a symphony of steel 
 Across the universe 
 Embracing all mankind 
 You can't break a metal heart 
 And it's far too wild to tame 
 There's something in our hearts worth fighting for 
 Some Secrets better left untold 
 And when the time has come for us to die 
 We'll take the Secrets to the graveOut of the darkness, the voices are calling 
 Riding the wings of a song 
 The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling 
 I feel it coming on strong 
 The lightning, strikes cracking the night 
 It feels like never before 
 Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark 
 I hear a rising force 
 Searching my soul, now I find something else 
 I take my life in my hands 
 Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell 
 The power is at my command 
 The lightning strikes, cracking the night 
 I'm not the same anymore 
 Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark 
 I feel a rising force 
 Burned by the glory of a sacred fire 
 The rising force starts to shine 
 A burning inferno, it soars ever higher 
 Leaving the demons behind 
 The lightning strikes, cracking the night 
 It feels like never before 
 Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark 
 I feel a rising force 
 The lightning strikes, cracking the night 
 I'm not the same anymore 
 Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark 
 I feel a rising forceWords unspoken, sworn in secrecy 
 A burning flame for the ones who believe 
 The prophecy 
 Revelations from the sun as of the moon 
 In seven nights we became history 
 The prophecy 
 On a cold dark night 
 We set our sails to search for land so far away 
 Searching for the truth 
 There's a howl in the wind 
 On this mystic trail of water we sail on 
 The source of youth 
 And the storm breaks loose on the seven seas 
 Tag on the signs on the mounting sun 
 Northern light is shining on for us 
 Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow 
 Setting the sails into the future 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrows 
 From the mountain side 
 Came a twisted wind, it brought us new insight 
 Whispering these words 
 Come in the midst you'll see 
 Said a voice, I thought it was the prophecy 
 The secrecy unheard 
 And on the violent sea there's tranquillity 
 We saw the signs on the mountain side 
 Northern light is shining on for us 
 Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow 
 Setting the sails into the future 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrows 
 A secret passage never to be found 
 In front of us a delusion of sight 
 The prophecy 
 From the mountains and the rivers down below 
 A silent breeze, there's a wail in the wind 
 The prophecy 
 We've come from a land so far away 
 We bow down to the words you pray 
 Storming down the mountain side 
 No place to go, no place to hide 
 Here we stand under of cover the moonlight 
 Oh, the prophecy was bound to fail 
 Here we are, nowhere to be found 
 We're trapped in another world and the journey's just begun 
 Ah, ah, ah... 
 Northern light is shining on for us 
 Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow 
 Setting the sails into the future 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrows 
 Northern light is shining on for us 
 Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow 
 Setting the sails into the future 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrowsLed by temptation into the underworld 
 To absence of season and time 
 Soldiers of Fortune, Soldiers of the Night 
 Back to back, ready to fight 
 Enchanted gardens, where Evil slipped away 
 Through darkness, fire and rage 
 Uncanny demons will dance upon your grave 
 As soon as you become their slave 
 Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn 
 The Bringer of Light, where are you now 
 Forever our hearts will burn 
 Immortal Riders, Protectors of the Earth 
 Lost in the abode of the dead 
 Misled through darkness and mislead by desire 
 Inside the midst of the fire 
 Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn 
 The Bringer of Light, where are you now 
 Forever our hearts will burn 
 Fallen Angels, arise from your graves 
 Free your spirits and unite 
 Before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night 
 From the ruins of hell we shall rise 
 On The Edge Of Honour we see the light 
 Of the Unicorn soaring the night 
 Lead: both 
 Born to conquer the fight, 
 Here we stand with the Future in our hands 
 Through fire we'll rise to touch the sky 
 Solo: Stefan 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
 Seeker of danger, is turning to withdraw 
 Our journey has come to an end 
 Lets stand together put trust in thy sword 
 Victory will marching toward 
 Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn 
 The Bringer of Light, where are you now 
 Forever our hearts will burn 
 Fallen Angels, arise from your graves 
 Free your spirits and unite 
 Before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night 
 From the ruins of hell we shall rise 
 On The Edge Of Honour we see the light 
 Of the Unicorn soaring the night 
 Lead: bothAs long as I remember 
 We've marched across this land 
 Oh, oh... 
 Reached for a new horizon 
 Pulled by the killing hand 
 Oh, oh... 
 All fed up with lies 
 The time has come 
 To break these chains and fly 
 Here we stand, bound forever more 
 Than out of this world, until the end 
 Here we are, mighty, glorious 
 At the end of the rainbow 
 With gold in our hands 
 We know the treasures lies 
 Beyond the pouring rain 
 Oh, oh... 
 Our quest will last forever 
 For you it's all the same 
 Oh, oh... 
 No one can deny 
 Our future's set 
 To reach above the sky 
 Here we stand, bound forever more 
 Than out of this world, until the end 
 Here we are, mighty, glorious 
 At the end of the rainbow 
 With gold in our hands 
 Let's fly away through the rain 
 Fly high, to ease the burning pain 
 Oh, the colours fading out 
 The light is shining in the night 
 It's up to you, it's worth the fight 
 Search before the colours fade 
 Here we stand, bound forever more 
 Than out of this world, until the end 
 Here we are, mighty, glorious 
 At the end of the rainbow 
 With gold in our handsFrom our lives' beginning on 
 We are pushed in little forms 
 No one asks us how we like to be 
 In school, they teach you what to think 
 But everyone says different things 
 But they're all convinced that 
 They're the ones to see 
 So, they keep talking, and they never stop 
 And at a certain point, you give it up 
 So, the only thing that's left to think is this: 
 I want out-to live my life alone 
 I want out-leave me be 
 I want out-to do things on my own 
 I want out-to live my life and to be free 
 People tell me "A" and "B" 
 They tell me how I have to see 
 Things that I have seen already clear 
 So, they push me then from side to side 
 They're pushing me from black to white 
 They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear 
 But don't push me to the maximum 
 Shut your mouth and take it home 
 'Cause I decide the way things gonna be 
 I want out-to live my life alone 
 I want out-leave me be 
 I want out-to do things on my own 
 I want out-to live my life and to be free 
 There's a million ways to see the things in life 
 A million ways to be the fool 
 In the end of it, none of us is right 
 Sometimes, we need to be alone 
 No, no, no... leave me alone! 
 I want out-to live my life alone 
 I want out-leave me be 
 I want out-to do things on my own 
 I want out-to live my life and to be free 
 I want outMany times this story has been told

 Winter paved my way, couldn't see nor believe 
 I watched the snow highlighting my grief

 He's pounding his sword to the ground 
 A soul made of fire 
 A heart made of solid steel, fear the sound 
 Guided by courage 
 The fear of eternal disgrace 
 The spirits of daring 
 The trail of his life brought fail to embrace 
 Trapped in the corner, hell or paradise 
 Forever failure or self-sacrifice 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 In the rising sun I stand 
 My true colours shining bright 
 Inside aeonian flames 
 Winding and turning 
 He's seeking a path to survive 
 The hunter's the hunted 
 The spectre within will soon come alive 
 The spirit of bearing by seven diverges unite 
 Never surrender, be ready to kill 
 When killing is right 
 Shame and dishonor, the wrath of the sword 
 Beyond all bearings, the honor restored 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 In the rising sun I stand 
 My true colours shining bright 
 Inside aeonian flames 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 I'm a soldier under command 
 In the setting sun I'll carry on 
 The code of the warrior soul 
 Honour, courage and rectitude 
 Tempered by ancient wisdom 
 One law, one life in solitude 
 Live by the code, die by the sword 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 In the rising sun I stand 
 My true colours shining bright 
 Inside aeonian flames 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 In the rising sun I stand 
 My true colours shining bright 
 Inside aeonian flames 
 I'm a warrior, I am 
 I'm a soldier under command 
 In the setting sun I'll carry on 
 The code of the warrior soul 
 This is the way!We saw the lights go down 
 The falling of the crown 
 The infidels, dethroned 
 Climbing up from their darkened abode 
 Your pious words won't mend 
 You're not from heaven sent 
 You're holier-than-thou 
 To the swords, to the guns, we must go 
 And so here we stand 
 We're the soldiers of the promised land 
 We are here, so please leave us be 
 We're fighting to live to be free 
 New breed, old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our veins 
 You say we are the same 
 But, who you are to blame? 
 Our mighty swords won't rust 
 When your hearts made of stone turns to dust 
 You're not the chosen ones 
 You're second to the guns 
 Your deeds are bound to fail 
 Better find you own path, your own trail 
 And so here we stand 
 We're the brethren of the promised land 
 We are free, to follow our dreams 
 Protecting our lives, by all means 
 New breed, old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our veins 
 New breed, old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our veins 
 Warriors - Hold your heads high 
 Glorious - High in the sky 
 The fire burns - Deep down inside 
 Glory for us, nothing for thee 
 New breed, old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our veins 
 New breed, old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our 
 Running through our veinsI saw your face in the morning sun 
 Oh, I thought you were there 
 I heard your voice as the wind passed me by 
 Silently, whispering my name 
 So many things that I wanted to say 
 Forever left untold 
 I still remember the tears that you shed 
 Over someone else 
 Our love could never die 
 All I can do is cry 
 Save a little prayer for the fallen one 
 There is a light down at memory lane 
 Slowly fading away 
 Still holding on to the dreams torn apart 
 I will follow my heart 
 Our love could never die 
 All I can do is cry 
 Save a little prayer for the fallen one 
 Still on my own, chasing the sun 
 Of a time long ago 
 The shade in my heart, tearing apart 
 Everything that I long for 
 Still on my own, chasing the sun 
 Of a time long ago 
 The shade in my heart, tearing apart 
 Everything that I long for 
 Guitar Interlude 
 I saw your face in the morning sun 
 Oh, I thought you were there 
 I heard your voice as the wind passed me by 
 Mhispering my name 
 Our love could never die 
 All I can do is cry 
 Save a little prayer for the fallen one 
 Ooh yeah.We are the voices in the dark 
 Inside the fire we are the 
 Eternal Spark that will guide the way 
 We are the stars up in sky 
 We gather winds so you can fly 
 We are the light when you're sleeping 
 All your dreams can come true 
 Where do we go? 
 We're just a heartbeat away 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder 
 We will stay by your side 
 Let our voices be there to guide you 
 We are forces in the rain 
 Inside your heart we are the 
 Unending answer to all your fears 
 So take a step towards the light 
 The crimson sky fulfills the night 
 The revelation is near 
 All your dreams can come true 
 Where do we go? 
 We're just a heartbeat away 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder? 
 We will stay by your side 
 Let our voices be there to guide you 
 All your dreams can come true? 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder?Thundering down from the mountain you ride 
 Clutching a sword made of steel 
 The ones you call friends they all left you for dead Alone on the 
 Battlefield many were at your command Renegade 
 Souls on your command Holding each life in your hand 
 Living for all and for one Shining into the night you 
 Are riding Through the darkness and light you are 
 Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the 
 Warrior Drunk with revenge from winch on one can 
 Hide Into their midst you will run A face from the 
 Grave is the last thing they'll see And die with your 
 Name on their tongue many were at your command 
 Renegade souls on the run Holding each life in your 
 Hand Living for all and for one Shining into the night 
 You are riding Through the darkness and light you are 
 Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the 
 Warrior Thundering down from the mountain you ride 
 Clutching a sword made of steel The ones you call 
 Friends they all left you for dead Alone on the 
 Battlefield Many were at your command Renegade 
 Souls on your command Holding each life in your hand 
 Living for all and for one Shining into the night you 
 Are riding Through the darkness and light you are 
 Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the 
 Warrior
