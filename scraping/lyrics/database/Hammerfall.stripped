Its midnight the clock strikes twelve 
 When the beasts come out and play 
 The headlines made it clear 
 Judgement day is near 
 Theyre crawling down the street 
 Sinking their razor teeth 
 Theyre knocking on every door 
 Now the steel begins to glow 
 Theyre vapourizing the earth no mercy 
 Into the battle they thrust 
 With power and lust 
 Ohohoh 
 Punish and enslave 
 Theres something a single spark 
 Out there in the dark 
 The metal is shining bright 
 Brings back hope and light 
 Bumbertobumber he reigns the wasteland 
 Turning their steel into dust he will never rust 
 All hail the chosen one  Fight proud dont touch the sun 
 Come join our steel parade  Together in the last crusade 
 All drop the hammers down  Burn out reclaim the crown 
 Speed demons never turn  at speed of light we ride running flatout lets crash and burn 
 Punish and enslaveOne More Time 
 One More Time 
 Saints  From Heaven 
 Hell hangarounds  Descending 
 Disciples of repression 
 Fuse  Our evil 
 Exterminate  Protectors 
 Bringing us down to the ground 
 And pushing us back to the 
 Final frontier wedlock in the grime 
 Cry a thousand tears battle one more time 
 Pray  Steel demons 
 Dont look away  Tormentors 
 Travers the darkned heavens 
 Seek  Our wicked 
 Seek and destroy  Opponents 
 Soldiers of heaven and hell 
 Hey  Were fighting 
 Eye for an eye  Protecting 
 Our Mother earth dissecting 
 Break  Their evil 
 Ruin the core  Allegiance 
 Vengeance is now in our hands 
 Vengeance 
 Pushing us back to the 
 Final frontier buried in the grime 
 Final frontier the judgement bell will chime 
 No wasted years stand up one more time 
 One More TimeOnce upon a time in a forlorn land 
 A man on a mission was left at fates hand 
 In his eyes you could see the whites turn red 
 Surrounded by evil abandoned for dead 
 Born on the run by the sign of the sun 
 A mailclad warrior the chosen one 
 His names been cursed he is bound to fail 
 A wandering spirit with the will to prevail 
 By the sign of the moon 
 He swore the oath to fight alone 
 Fight with your heart and youre Destined For 
 Glory 
 But fight without honor and youre destined to 
 Fall 
 He still can recall his fathers words 
 Dont lose your faith let your voice be heard 
 Echoes from the past will lead him on 
 By these words of honor shine like the sun 
 By the sign of the moon 
 But fight without soul and you will loose it all 
 The prophecies spoke of a wandering man 
 Skilled with steel black as the night 
 Normally veiled from the mortal eyes 
 His hammer arose like a magic force 
 With a gaze that turned everything into stone 
 The warrior spoke I am the one 
 But fight without soul and you will loose it allHeed the words my son 
 Here is where my journey ends 
 I pass my legacy for you to carry on 
 You are the future I am the past 
 These words of wisdom might be my very last 
 The insurrection will show your direction 
 After years of deceit 
 The futures in deadlock the peal of the death clock 
 A redblooded brick in the wall 
 Retrogression here in neverland 
 Carry through utopia 
 r Evolution  rise and resist 
 r Evolution  fight to exist 
 r Evolution  a wrecking ball 
 r Evolution  free for all 
 Years of oppression dark agony 
 No evolution the unborns dim destiny 
 Retaliation unite our nations 
 All give heed to the call 
 Youre the selected preferred and elected 
 Wave your banners here in neverland 
 Speak up for utopia 
 Cause no sticks and stones 
 Could ever break my bones 
 Nor their words 
 Could ever quench my soul 
 r Evolution  free for allReturned from the dark side I found a greater truth 
 No doubts or delusions no higher absolute 
 A walk through the ages through history and time 
 Ive seen all the treason all done by mankind 
 I deny your illusions 
 Reject your forceful demands 
 My dreams are so real now they all come alive 
 The age of enlightenment the power of your mind 
 Wheels of history turning 
 Respinning out of control 
 So many mountains climb to be falsified 
 My spirit is second to none 
 And my heart cant be denied 
 My soul is my furnace my never ending craze 
 My body is my temple a wellprotected maze 
 False messiah rejected 
 Return to your distorted prophecies 
 Returned from the light side 
 Some answers left to find 
 In search of my brothers 
 My one of a kind 
 My heart is torn between heaven and hell 
 Your gods are rejected 
 All false prophets will fallSacrifice  Victory 
 No Sacrifice  No Victory 
 Once there was gold at the end of the rainbow 
 Honored by blood we kept searching for more 
 Light turned to dark as we lost what we fought for 
 Now we have come to settle the score 
 Sacrifice  Victory 
 Light brings us light on the pale darkened heavens 
 Lead us towards our vast victory 
 Fighting for all that we brothers believe in 
 Together united were standing all for one 
 On our pathway to glory we stand together and honored by blood 
 Sacrifice our resplendence we fight for freedom hold our grounds forever 
 By the code we are living we are breathing and then we die 
 Sacrifice our own lives but well never stand to lose our pride and glory 
 Solo Pontus Norgren 
 In the end only truth will survive no matter what you sacrifice 
 So you cant harvest your glory all based on deceit cause no one will swallow your lies 
 On our pathway to glory we stand together honored by blood 
 VictoryIts been a long cold winter widespread snowfall raging storms 
 Caught in winds delusions of our heart and soul 
 He came down from the mountains into our own frozen world 
 Spoke of revolution fed us with his words 
 A sacred man from the other side 
 He gave us something to believe in 
 How could we be so blind 
 His right hand gave us freedom while the other stole the pride 
 Thought he had the answers standing by his side 
 Tales of a world not so far away 
 We got entangled in his vows 
 When the sun and moon unite 
 Fear Dark Winged messenger dread his darkened words 
 Solo Stefan 
 A graven image shattered a meltdown of our wonderland 
 As the sun rised slowly we tried to understand 
 A sacred heart lost prosperity 
 But we found a way back home 
 From dusk came clarity 
 Fear the Dark Winged messenger dread his darkened words 
 Fear the Dark Winged messenger dread his darkened wordsIts been a long way but now we are near 
 The midst of the fiery rain 
 We know the Thunder have summoned us all 
 To the place were innocence got slain 
 Behold the omens the rivers run red 
 The autumn winds carry the dead 
 The final warning the very last command 
 Shattered remains for the damned 
 We wont surrender 
 No never we will carry on 
 From the Lake of Fire they have come 
 Fierce almighty legions one by one 
 When the Flames of Glory touch the sky 
 Trailblazers do or die 
 We are the mighty who soar through the air 
 Creating our own destiny 
 Warriors once and Warriors to be 
 Forever our spirits fly free 
 We rode on lightning we shone like the sun 
 In a thunderous symphony 
 We fought them hard we fought them so brave 
 Sending them back to their grave 
 The Hammer has fallen 
 The fire still burns in our hearts 
 The visions we gazed upon 
 As the nightmare returned 
 On the uncaring slopes 
 The mark of the shadows still burns 
 Trailblazers do or dieGrey morning dawn won the fight 
 Daylight drives away the night 
 Fogs rising out in the fields 
 The birth of winter is in sight 
 Dark shadows fall from the sky 
 They alight on gallows tree 
 Black feathers amber beaks 
 Waiting for their Deity 
 Leaves are spinning round 
 Lost and never found 
 When the King takes the Crown 
 Can you feel 
 The autumn wind blowing 
 Ravenlord is coming to stay 
 Can you hear 
 The passing bell tolling 
 Ravenlord  takes you far away 
 Sharp talons pinions of ice 
 They obscure the newborn day 
 Hot breathing freezes to snow 
 Piercing caws lead you astray 
 Leaves are spinning roundSighs 
 The fury has electrified my mind 
 Sighs 
 The hatred burns inside 
 By the mark of vengeance I will grind 
 The sound of metal falling to the ground 
 By blood we will unite 
 By blood we are forever bound 
 Vengeance calling me 
 Oh please set me free 
 The fury of the wild 
 Locked up in this cage 
 Cant you feel the rage 
 Your silence will not sanctify your crime 
 When revolution calls I will be the first in line 
 Now as you stand on your own 
 With the future face to face 
 Take a look at me now 
 Feel the fury taste my rage 
 Come taste my revenge 
 Unbent unbowed unbroken 
 The fury of the wildFire burns Fire burns Fire burns 
 You danced with the devil 
 Now your soul is bruised and scarred 
 There aint no pride and dignity 
 Weve been down the rusty boulevard 
 You lived your life 
 Thought youd be immortalized 
 The moral of your story 
 What goes up must come back down 
 Fire burns 
 The fire burns forever 
 The fire burns forever more 
 A moment of silence 
 Just before you hit the stage 
 This is your day of reckoning 
 To pay back all the dues and turn the page 
 You hit rock bottom 
 And you stood the count to ten 
 Came back to harvest glory 
 Now your star will shine again 
 Cause every step 
 The light races follow 
 Cause every move we make 
 Might be our last mistake 
 Fire fire burnOur time has come get ready fight 
 Sisters and brothers in metal unite 
 The dreams that you had are about to come true 
 The voice of the warrior is calling for you 
 Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory 
 And he will make you see 
 This is the way we want it to be 
 This is The Way Of The Warrior 
 Walking the way the honest will see 
 Walking The Way Of The Warrior 
 Walking the way The Way Of The Warrior 
 Bloodred the steel of our swords shall flow 
 And by the allegiance were ready to go 
 Stout are the foe in warfare so bold 
 Nothing can stop us the future we hold 
 Brace up defend 
 Never ever be outdone in bravery 
 The saints and the sinners in battle so bright as the forces of steel will unite 
 The way of the warrior the call of his life shall lead us all into the light 
 The metal crusade will conquer all 
 Our bonds will be stronger see the infidels fall 
 Surrender your soul to the Gods of steel 
 In the blood of the fallen the enemies kneel 
 This is the way we want it 
 This is the way we need it 
 This is the waySo here I am once more the devil in disguise 
 Youve seen me before 
 I stray the earth alone across the seven seas 
 To settle the score 
 I stand behind I am your dark reflection 
 Last thing you see when you die 
 Demonized 
 Possessed by the devil Im in disguise 
 A blackhearted soul screaming all but lies 
 Welcome to enter my final mass 
 A sinister snake in the grass 
 So many times before 
 Ive seen the world go down 
 By the touch of my hand 
 So if you wanna fly wanna fly across the sky 
 To find the promised land 
 Your wings will burn 
 Theres nothing left above us 
 A paradise lost to my crown 
 You spread your wings melting in the sunlight 
 The fear of the future hands down 
 Im strungout I am the air that you breathe 
 I will make you choke addicted 
 I feed on your needs 
 A sinister snake in the grassI feel uptight on a Saturday night 
 Nine oclock the radios the only light 
 I hear my song and it pulls me through 
 Comes on strong tells me what I gotta do 
 I got to 
 Get up 
 Everybodys gonna move their feet 
 Get down 
 Everybodys gonna leave their seat 
 You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City 
 Getting late I just cant wait 
 Ten oclock and I know I gotta hit the road 
 First I drink then I smoke 
 Start the car and I try to make the midnight show 
 Movin fast down 95 
 Hit top speed but Im still movin much too slow 
 I feel so good Im so alive 
 Hear my song playin on the radio 
 It goes 
 Twelve oclock I gotta rock 
 Theres a truck ahead lights starin at my eyes 
 Oh my God no time to turn 
 I got to laugh cause I know Im gonna die 
 Why 
 Everybodys gonna leave their seatSolo Stefan Elmgren 
 There was a time when we were noble soldiers 
 Fearless and wild a fight just to survive 
 Reformed our troops one flag one world united 
 Under the sun the powers came alive 
 The sound of our cause the meaning of life 
 Beyond stars and skies 
 Now raise your hands and let it all come out 
 Bring the Hammer Down 
 Slam it down to the ground 
 One flag one world united 
 Templars fight or fall 
 Raise your fists heed the call 
 Bring the Hammer Down behold the light 
 The future holds nothing but pain and sorrow 
 No painted skies we dwell in black and white 
 Just live your life like there is no tomorrow 
 Present today forgotten before dawn 
 Still counting the stars in search for a way 
 The meaning of life 
 Now raise your hands before your time runs out 
 Solo Pontus Stefan bothThe morning breaks 
 As a new day begins 
 And Im still on the road 
 To nowhere 
 No sign of life 
 In his eyes 
 No emotion shown at all 
 Just like water through my hands 
 In his heart in his eyes in his soul 
 Theres no sign of thunder 
 Screams Scream 
 Can you hear the screaming 
 When another restless soul must die 
 A glorious ride 
 To become immortalized 
 As you sought your inner dreams 
 And visions 
 Your final words 
 Caught by the wind 
 Never to be heard again 
 Your last will to be forever free 
 Can you hear the screaming 
 When another restless soul 
 When another restless soul must dieThere is a crying in the nightfall 
 There is a howling in the wind 
 And when the urge is getting stronger 
 We hit the streets the city calls 
 The night is free for all 
 We rule the dark and we do as we please 
 And nothing can stop us 
 No time to catch some Zs 
 Howlin With The Pac 
 Fighting for the right to be 
 Templars of the first degree 
 We never minded any warnings 
 Or asked directions from the stars 
 And when the moon stops its ascending 
 We feel the rush the inner glow 
 The crimson will flow 
 We have the might and the power to succeed 
 Cause were the restless breed 
 And when our allegiance is falling down 
 We will crawl back from hell 
 Reclaim the crown 
 The sign is shining for us 
 Its glow will lead us on our way 
 When we are led astray 
 No no

 Templars of the first degreeWildfire  wildfire  wildfire 
 I am the one running out of control 
 I am faster than the speed of light 
 There is a darkness surrounding my life 
 And its claws gotta hold of my sight 
 Im leaving the past behind wander off into the wild 
 Pin down my future at last moving on nowhere fast 
 Like a wildfire 
 Wildfire  wildfire  wildfire 
 Hellbent for metal it clouded my mind 
 Like a force of destruction and rage 
 Possessed by possessions it all choked me up 
 I must fly bursting out of my cage 
 Im free set at liberty no chains are pinning me down 
 My scornful eye takes me places no one dares to go 
 Bathe in the rays of the sun 
 Feeding my inner flame 
 Why are we wasting our time 
 Watching horizons go down 
 Standing there patient in one fine line 
 Wildfire  wildfire  wildfireSo where were you when darkness came to life 
 Inside a dream that controlled your inner plight 
 Take a look at me youve ruined what we had 
 Inner visions infrared it drives me mad 
 Out of control 
 The system mounted on the wall 
 For every soul theres no way out 
 In this world where nothing lives 
 The walls are caving in lifes a sin 
 In this world we have to give 
 Before we all can see the Templar Flame 
 Do you believe surveillance is the cure 
 The remedy for our insanity 
 Take a look around and tell me what you see 
 Souls walking planlessly like you and me 
 In infrared 
 Controlling what is left to see 
 Awake the dead theres no way out 
 You see the words  speak 
 In infrared  speak 
 You see the words 
 Damn the machine  speak 
 Speak of the flame 
 The Templar Flame 
 Oh oh ohIn 1981 the metal struck like thunder 
 The harmonious noise all linked in one voice 
 A croon across the nation 
 My soul was ripped and torn I couldnt resist the power 
 The music I heard the thunderous words 
 My gate to liberation 
 It made us rock it made us lose our self control 
 Bang Your Head  Stand United 
 It was the spark the flame setting our hearts on fire 
 Creating our dreams our lives and our means 
 Were howling with desire 
 We came to rock we came to lose our self control 
 The years kept passing by 
 No wind of change could bring us down 
 Cause we are one my friend 
 We stand together till the end 
 This is our destiny 
 Our will our life our honored crown 
 Our dream is ours to dream 
 Our beats out beat forevermore 
 Now Templars bang your heads and unite 
 It made us rock it made us roll forever more 
 Bang Your Head 
 Bang Your HeadDay after day we all try to find a way 
 Fighting to be brave 
 Keep the wicked far at bay 
 We ride across the battlefield 
 Theres nothing left to find 
 You hear the vultures cry 
 Now their task is yours to grind 
 The last sun will soon ignite 
 An everlasting blight 
 We must find the Star of Home 
 Time will end at break of dawn 
 One more odyssey remain 
 Leave this desert plain 
 Destinations far away 
 Into universe we stray 
 To a place known as forever 
 Countdown begins 
 We must leave this place of sin 
 Theres blood everywhere 
 When the rivers running red 
 A vigil for the dying world 
 Resurrections last crusade 
 Fragments left of life 
 Shattered pieces from the blade 
 A deathwatch for the human race 
 Lifes falling down from grace 
 Across the sacred universe we travel on 
 Well find our remedy 
 Our home away from home travel on 
 To a place known as foreverSee the outlaw stands alone beneath the burning sun 
 The raging badlands now is his home 
 Theres no sign of victory he lost his liberty 
 And the only woman that he loved 
 An outlaw chasing outlaws a runner in the night 
 By the radiant moon he will strike 
 The seeker of all dangers has come to take his toll 
 From the dead of night he will arise 
 Renegade Renegade 
 Committed the ultimate sin 
 This time the prowler will win 
 He stalks in shadow lands soundless with gun in hand 
 Striking like a reptile so fierce 
 No chance to get away no time for your last prayer 
 When the prowler sneaks up from behind 
 An outlaw chasing outlaws the hunter takes his pray 
 The law of the jungle he obeys 
 Craving for the danger to even out the scores 
 Face to face once and for all 
 Renegade renegade 
 On through the night he rides on his raging horse made of steel 
 Nothing can save you now before the renegade you will kneel 
 This time the prowler will winYou come to see the show 
 Well were going to rock and roll you 
 Come and get on your seat

 Oh lets get so crazy tonight 
 Let me hear you rock and roll 
 MZALate at night in the park 
 I saw them slipping in the dark 
 For heaven sake whats going on 
 Its like someone is here 
 Gotta follow now 
 Like being in a trance for me 
 Theres silence here 
 More than all the noise 
 Spurting in the dark head over heels 
 Overheated heart head over heels 
 Treating it so hard the spurting feels 
 Every day every night 
 Oh yeah 
 Down on my knees God help me please 
 Gotta know whos out in the dark 
 Ive stopped my breath cant feel the hands 
 Could hear the sound of people making love 
 I surrender right now 
 Ive to be touched 
 I feel so much 
 Yeah 
 Head over heels 
 Every day every nightI gave up my life 
 To follow another destiny 
 To find the hidden sun 
 The source of the spark and the flame 
 Now the universe is closed 
 Let the blackening dissolution start 
 The aether shining impurified 
 Lets burn out the vile from the dark 
 Vile from the dark 
 I kneel down and pray 
 The elements gather around me 
 Envision my destined path 
 I can no longer avoid 
 I see the 
 Black sun rising 
 Fall material god 
 Opus Magnum 
 Seize Redemption 
 My uprising 
 Find the sun and the moon 
 Absolution 
 Unification the spiritualized 
 Will unlock the gate be unlimited 
 Unification of man and his god 
 Will limit your life lock the gate 
 Now the elements are at peace 
 Come the reddening gaze upon the sky 
 Seven planets silver and gold 
 The seven metals aligned 
 And now the 
 Seize RedemptionThere are clouds on the horizon 
 Shifting colours heavy rain 
 High above the roaring thunder 
 Shooting bullets through your brain 
 Theres something wicked left behind 
 A baleful sight a coming 
 A sinister state of your minds 
 Behold the skies the port of heaven 
 Take the stairway down to hell 
 The gate is open lift the curse 
 We set aside our dreams and visions 
 We are one we will unite 
 At the Threshold of the universe we will rise 
 Late at night they heard the sirens 
 From a place so far away 
 Allied forces mighty brethren 
 In a vesture of decay 
 They are the legions of the night 
 Turning darkness into 
 Turning the dark into light 
 At the Threshold of the universe 
 Solo Stefan 
 At the Threshold of the universeNever thought Id feel again 
 Feel the darkness fade and see the morning sun arise 
 Never thought Id feel alive again 
 Senses dull and blunt from all the lies 
 Now when I hold your face so close to mine 
 I see a place where the sun will shine 
 With you it is divine 
 Looking down into those eyes 
 I know 
 Ill be lost and never found again 
 Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die 
 Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side 
 If Dreams Come True 
 Do I dare to trust this time 
 Ooh the Bells of Fortune 
 Will I ever hear them chime 
 Only those who have been burned before 
 Truly know the meaning of Hells flaming core 
 I was the brooding night and you were dawn 
 Saving me for I was forlorn 
 In your light I am reborn 
 Then when the walls are breaking down on us 
 When all we see is misery 
 Will you still believe in me 
 Until the sign of winter Dreams Come True 
 Always by your sideThe passion of broken hearts the passion of pain 
 Flames of the mortal world the fire still burns 
 Out of the dark the winter is coming 
 The passion of broken souls their passion is pain 
 Forever crying forever dead 
 Out of the dark the winter is near 
 I am lost in confusion 
 I am trapped between worlds 
 Im a wolf on the prowl in the night 
 Take the black you win or you die 
 First of the ancient men the bloodline is strong 
 A star from beyond the wall will rescue us all 
 Out of the dark the winter is hereWhere have I been I dont know where to begin 
 Memories flash right and painfully clash 
 Forever gone my mind is clear but undone 
 Storms raging on sensing the other one 
 Here in the thunderous silence I sit petrified 
 Knowing the Twilight Princess will come 
 I hear her lies piercing through me hypnotized 
 Cursing the skies who I become I despise 
 I had no choice 
 All is lost  cant rejoice 
 Nothing but noise 
 And her sweet sweet voice 
 No as the dusk is approaching I hear her again 
 Its the Twilight Princess I fear 
 Oh her beauty ethereal out of this world 
 Because the Twilight Princess is here 
 Give me a reason you wont give me a sign 
 Give me a reason to cross the line 
 Darkness has come 
 And the last rays of sunlight are gone 
 What matters now wont matter soon 
 In the light of the moon 
 I once was dead time standing still and at last 
 Free in my head never remember the past 
 I must obey finding an innocent prey 
 To make the Twilight Princess smile 
 Always astray need her to show me the way 
 It is my Twilight Princess trial 
 Yes as the dusk is approaching I hear her again 
 Its the Twilight Princess I see 
 Because the Twilight Princess is me 
 Shes always with meOn a dusty shelf buried over ground 
 In the corner of the attic 
 Where the bats come out and play 
 Oh they linger on 
 Preserved embraced in silence 
 A script a tale kept from the light of day 
 The fear of God 
 A recital of a story only for the strong to find 
 As you kneel down you feel the cold wind blow 
 Kill the switch lock all the exits 
 The curse the spell the words begin to glow 
 The sun is silent 
 Nine circles the passage into the abyss 
 Ex inferis remember my name 
 Ex inferis demon from hell 
 Abandon hope as you step inside 
 The rebellion of angels 
 Who reside these darkened shores 
 Oh waist deep in ice 
 Surrounded by the fire 
 The purgatory gate nowhere to go 
 This is your calling 
 Malicious and violent the circles of hell 
 Limbo lust and gluttony 
 Rage out of control 
 Greed and anger heresy 
 The price to cleanse thy soul 
 All for one but none for all 
 Enslaved we will succumb 
 Violence fraud no kingdome come 
 Reborn in treachery 
 Ex inferisOnce there was a time when we were standing back 
 To back against the whole conception 
 Once we had it all the world was a precious home 
 Times were changing fast our dreams were fading black 
 The darkness fell on our creation 
 Time was running out we were falling one by one 
 We live by honor we fight for freedom we die but you cant slay our pride 
 Behind these walls we deem take hold of the dream 
 To live our lives as we please 
 Metal Genocide 
 No fear we know the end is near 
 One day we will retaliate 
 Genocide 
 Fall mighty Babylon your might is declining fast 
 Youre on your knees repent your sinning 
 Far beyond the realms of hell we are born again 
 SoloStefan 
 One day we will retaliate 
 GenocideHammer high this is a freedom cry 
 Hammer high no one should ask me why 
 Its my life  proudly I will defy 
 Hammer high until I die 
 Black clouds on the horizon 
 Dread crimson skies 
 The thunder within the sign to begin 
 A tempest of fire and ice 
 I keep my courage blazing 
 Withhold this grounds 
 Protecting the steal this is my deal 
 The flames of my anger my will 
 Remember the frozen tears 
 Turning each second to years 
 A meltdown in paradise 
 Revolution calling Break the ice 
 Hammer high this is a freedom cry 
 The rapid fire pounding 
 To the beat of my heart 
 Lets make a stand 
 True to till the end 
 Warrior under command 
 Im melting the frozen ice 
 Burning the books filled with lies 
 And inside the pouring rain 
 Things will never ever be the same 
 The strong will survive 
 In the end its the game 
 Forever defy 
 Hammer high up in the sacred sky 
 Hear me now this is a freedom cry 
 Its my life  no one should ask me why 
 Hammer high I wont conform and die 
 Will defy until I die 
 Hammer high until I dieWhos there 
 Walking the shadows I fear 
 I am in deep 
 The nightmares they wont disappear 
 Leave me alone 
 Lay down 
 Lay down your arms on the ground 
 Youve been sent here 
 To champion for the unbound yeah 
 Satans scheme falls into place 
 An evil grin upon his face 
 No fear 
 The duels about to begin 
 Ive got a black hand 
 The hand of the dead man can win yeah 
 Satan slips another ace 
 A thousand souls will fall from grace 
 Evil incarnate the son of man 
 Lost to the great deceiver 
 Evil incarnate I failed the plan 
 A new inception reigns 
 A new inception reignsThe hands of time have brought you here 
 To make a change to break down the walls 
 You are the ones and you are the only 
 Trying to live by your own goals 
 And you all cry for freedom 
 Raise your fists to the sky 
 Let your voice speak for the revolution 
 All join forces with all the powers that you feel 
 Let your heart beat for the revolution 
 Led by the Templars of Steel 
 Lets spread the word of the sole survivors 
 With metal pounding inside their souls 
 The fire burns and it will forever 
 Blaze for the ones who stands strong 
 With your fists in the sky 
 You are the Templars of Steel 
 Oh oh oh  
 You are the Templars of SteelIt started with the holy water rising to a boil 
 The crops went bad no life could breed beneath the rotten soil 
 Imprisoned for his make beliefs impending dire views 
 Became accountable for every flaw spreading the news 
 Disturbing dreams of the future  reverie 
 Seven flights of imagination 
 These taunting dreams no one could read or even understand 
 Delusion of insanity banned from his fatherland 
 Just leave the ship and swim ashore lifes hanging by a thread 
 Days of mass destruction harmageddon lies ahead 
 Bring out the Outlaw how do you plead 
 To the allegation 
 Bring out the Outlaw charge him decree 
 Eternal damnation 
 So seven years of devastation followed in the land 
 One for every prophecy served by the almighty hand 
 The outlaw was imprisoned for scattering his dreams 
 None stood up to hold his ground spineless so it seems 
 Bring out the Outlaw could you forsee 
 The allegation 
 Let us bring out the Outlaw 
 A life could be saved if someone stood up for his rights 
 Now cursed and condemned mistreated on his last nocturnal flight 
 Call for the Outlaw help us forsee 
 Gods allegation 
 Call for the Outlaw charge us decree 
 Eternal damnationBack in 1095 when the call to arms came 
 We had the red cross sewn on 
 Sent to save the holy land and crush the infidels 
 With strength from above 
 Steel meets steel 
 On towards victory we march the guiding star 
 Lead us to the battle field 
 There the heathens were subdued and in the end 
 We forced them all to yield or die 
 In July in 99 the Holy City was stormed and won 
 Jerusalem was freed we thanked the lord for our glory 
 We the Templars have survived by honor and pride 
 And the blessing of the sword 
 The quest of the war forever sung 
 To the sound of steel meets steel 
 Steel meets steelI breathe alone my skin begins to peel 
 Forsaken in my misery to battle this ordeal 
 I cant resist the cravings no I have to ease the pain 
 My screaming brain is melting slowly turning me insane 
 Devastation all across the nation 
 Infected but I am not alone 
 My days are numbered but I am patient 
 From zero the counting has begun 
 I resist resistance I survive the hangmans noose 
 Future looks sinister Im a zombie on the loose 
 Cause I feed in darkness I feast in broad daylight 
 Whatever you do better hold on tight and stay out of my sight 
 Evacuation all across the nation 
 Our days are numbered and we are patient 
 To zero the countdown has begun 
 We exist but our hearts dont beat 
 The streets our sacred haven 
 Fight or flee dont waste another round 
 We exist but our eyes run red 
 The dead will feast upon you 
 Aiming high dont chocke or youll be downed 
 Retribution a suicide solution 
 Infected but you are not alone 
 Our lives are numbered and we are all patient 
 To zero the countdown has begunRide through the valley in thunder and rain 
 The battle is raging redeem this domain 
 The Castle of Eden lies silent above 
 Darkness surrounded us away we must go 
 I look through the eyes of the world 
 I see theres a Stranger among us 
 Awaiting a sign from above 
 To conquer the power and the glory 
 Enter the battle our will to enchain 
 Bringing us forward defeating the pain 
 Into the meeting with swords made of steel 
 Were standing together the secret reveals 
 I know whos the Stranger among us 
 To conquer the power and glory 
 Repeat 2x 
 Come across to the Promised Land 
 Close your eyes I will take your hand 
 Through the river of steel well go 
 When the dragon lies bleeding 
 Above the glory well carry on 
 Now the time has come to return back home 
 The setting sun illuminates the dead 
 The battlefield field is shining red 
 Silent lies Eden on top of the moor 
 Were fighting with honor protecting our Lord 
 The last one survivor lies bleeding I kneel 
 Into his heart I settle the steel 
 There is no stranger among us 
 We march to the end of the world 
 In search for the power and the glory 
 Repeat 4x 
 When the dragon lies bleedingTheres never been any reason 
 Or escape for the treason 
 You just think of a time far away 
 I feel your flame and your anguish 
 I know your plans and your last wish 
 You just cant face another day 
 Angel of Mercy take her to your homeland 
 Angel of Mercy you can feel the signs 
 Its the End its the End 
 Youve stood along the life line 
 Youve played the fool for the last time 
 You just want the joy and the peace 
 Youve heard all the laughter 
 Youve seen what youre after 
 You just want the rest and the sleep 
 Angel Of Mercy Angel Of Mercy 
 Lead Stefan 
 You can hear the clocks tick 
 As you scheme for your last fix 
 From a place you never will awake 
 I hear your cry into the night 
 I hear you die within my fright 
 But now youve saved your mistake 
 Angel Of Mercy 
 Angel of Mercy Angel of Mercy 
 Angel of Mercy Angel of MercyI cover the trail behind me stay out of the light 
 Theres something alive in the darkness 
 I can feel the power and its might 
 For years I have walked in the shadows 
 Banned for my beliefs 
 Cause around me the walls are falling 
 Bridges burn in flames without a spark 
 Cause Im searching high and low 
 Through dark places I must go 
 I am the one you should not blame 
 Hallowed be my Name  My Name 
 Theres no place for me in heaven nor a place in hell 
 Sentenced to walk here forever 
 This will be my final place to dwell 
 I walk alone no legions will follow my path 
 A stranger to my own shadow 
 But somethings wrong I can feel it to the bone 
 When I stand on sea and shore 
 Storms will rage and ocean roar 
 I raise my hammer take my aim 
 Vultures fly the ravens cry 
 No stars are shining on the darkened sky 
 One allegiance sun and moon 
 My eyes are red my soul is turning into black 
 Cause Hallowed be my Name 
 You can lie and crush my heart 
 Steal my soul tear me apart 
 Still its something you cannot claim 
 Hallowed be my Name  My NameOur sun is set our day is done 
 Im left here wondering 
 Is this the end my final words to you 
 Day turned to night 
 Now youre gone Im left here pondering 
 Can this be true are we really through 
 You were the wind beneath my wings 
 Taught me how to fly 
 With you I lived among the kings 
 How could this ever die 
 So I say farewell Im yours forever 
 And I always will be 
 We were one we were all we were the only 
 Future full of hope nothing could stand in our way 
 But dreams can change visions fall I feel so lonely 
 I would walk through fire for just one more day 
 You were the angel of my life 
 Taught me to be free 
 Now Im a stranger in your eyes 
 Walls are closing in on me 
 Missing you in my heart you are the one 
 And you always will be 
 When I turn to the east I see no dawn 
 But after darkness comes the light 
 When I turn to the west the silent night hides all 
 Where is the light that shines so bright 
 Nahnahna and you always will be 
 My little one you are 
 And you always will beSnow is falling down on this glorious land 
 Colours fading turning into white again 
 To fallen heroes angels sing they cry their winter tears 
 Endless mourning days will turn to years 
 So this is goodbye I take leave of you and 
 Spread your wings and you will fly away now fly away now 
 Nothing on earth stays forever 
 But none of your deeds were in vain 
 Deep in our hearts you will live again 
 Youre gone to the home of the brave 
 Every solemn moment I will treasure inside 
 Even though its hard to understand 
 That a silent wind can blow the candle out 
 Taking everything leaving the pain far behind 
 You call out my name but your voice is fading 
 Into the wind embraced youll fly away now fly away 
 Now 
 Repeat x2 
 My eyes are closed I feel youre far away 
 Far beyond that shining star 
 I know youll find what youve been fighting for 
 Down on bended knee I pray bring courage to these Souls 
 Makeem live forever in the heart of the bold 
 So I say farewell my friends I hope well meet again 
 When my time has come to fall from grace 
 Repeat x8 
 Youre gone to the home of the braveSitting in my room staring at the wall 
 I cant believe its happening 
 Once so wonderful 
 Now lifes a twisted kind of reality a fantasy 
 Dont know where to begin 
 Saw your love for me vanish in a single moment of stupidity 
 Nightmare this may be but it is not a dream ooh 
 I want to scream a broken heart still bleeds 
 Never ever talk never ever smile 
 Knowing that my life wont be the same 
 Never ever touch never ever feel 
 I will never hear you call my name again 
 In my dreams I see see you come to me 
 A memory of times of old 
 Waking up I realize hells as cool as ice 
 And the touch of sin did get me in 
 Nothing burns like the cold 
 As we sin so do we suffer 
 Ive fallen from grace 
 Want to turn back time and make it undone 
 I will never hear you call my name 
 All I see a future full of fear 
 I can never whisper in your ear Im sorryYou come to see the show 
 Well were gonna rock and roll you 
 Were gonna make you feel all right 
 Heay you wanna go crazy tonight 
 Well were gonnad rock and pile you 
 Were gonna do our best 
 The best kicks you in the head all right 
 Yeah its gonna get crazy tonight 
 Heay Sing Heay 
 Well were gonna rock and shock you 
 The sound hits you in the face all right 
 Let me here you rock and roll 
 Heay Heay 
 Solo 
 Heay Sing HeayYou made me see right past myself 
 Well beyond my fears 
 Realized Im synchronized 
 Far beyond my years 
 Im so geared into them 
 I serve unto their souls 
 Now that Im addicted 
 My hunger only grows 
 Im a Child of the Damned 
 I follow where I go 
 Rigging to the cross 
 As holy as a whore 
 Im just a child of the damned 
 Witches coven the time is come 
 For those sabbatical years 
 Revelation is the message 
 For all in all to hear 
 Prophets slayed mankind arrayed 
 Into a mass submission 
 Evils here and the lord of hell 
 Gives you the proposition 
 Give away your lifes goals 
 Your meaning and ambition 
 It means nothing to you 
 After all its superstition 
 Do not be afraid 
 The world is near the end 
 Is it better to rule in hell 
 Than it is to serve in heaven 
 Im just a child of the damnedTheres silence in the dark 
 Theres the fire ready to start 
 Stone pages inked by fury 
 The exception of the damned 
 They are calling out my name 
 Come join us and carry the flame 
 Our precious time is standing still 
 When the future meets the past 
 No freedom no glory 
 Theres no future no past 
 This will be our one last wish one last dream 
 When you follow the masses or follow your own 
 One last chance one last dream 
 Before your future will be Carved In Stone 
 I remember what they said 
 I still hear them inside me head 
 The legions of damnation 
 They keep calling out my name 
 The wind blows forever 
 But the time standing still 
 Knock knock on my door 
 Please revoke what youre asking for 
 One last wish one last dream 
 Before your future will be 
 One last wish one last dream Carved In Stone 
 One last chance one last dream Carved In Stone 
 Before your future will be Carved In StoneAs I open up my eyes 
 I see a face I dont recognize 
 If the mirror tells the truth 
 Then who the hell am I 
 I scan the surface high and low 
 What arises from above 
 Everything I cant detect 
 Not a thing I will neglect 
 Countdown Im coming through 
 And the vengeance and the taker 
 And the one that shining sun 
 Shadow Empire 
 The rise of the machine 
 They rise up from their graves to steal our dreams 
 I see the world in infrared 
 Hear the voices of the dead 
 Im half man and half machine 
 The essence of your dream 
 Soon the judgment bell will toll 
 Well take back everything they stole 
 Im the judge the hammer fall 
 Liberty and metal for all 
 Countdown your time has come 
 And the vengeance youre in danger 
 Youre the one let justice be done 
 They rise up from their graves to steal our vivid dreams 
 In my heart there is always winter 
 Can not rest until I found the master key 
 The master key of trust 
 In my mind the arctic wind blows 
 Can not sleep I can not rest before the dawn brings back the light 
 Light of day 
 They rise up from their graves to steal our vivid dreamsThere I was completely wasting 
 Out of work and down 
 All inside its so frustrating 
 As I drift from town to town 
 Feel as though nobody cares 
 If I live or die 
 So I might as well begin 
 To put some action in my life 
 Breaking the law breaking the law 
 So much for the golden future 
 I cant even start 
 Ive had every promise broken 
 Theres anger in my heart 
 You dont know what its like 
 You dont have a clue 
 If you did youd find yourselves 
 Doing the same thing too 
 Breaking the law breaking the lawOut in the fields 
 The full moon is rising 
 Enlightens the name on our shields 
 Blessed with pride 
 Steel on our side 
 We horsemen of thunder 
 The ground starts to shake as we ride 
 Side by side 
 Stormbringer lead us into the unknown 
 On wings of glory we will carry on 
 Legacy of Kings  LEGACY OF KINGS 
 Forever to survive were 
 Riding on the winds  riding on the winds 
 Unchained and free alive forevermore 
 Deep in the night 
 We circle around them 
 The honor compels us to fight 
 All for one 
 All hewed with steel 
 In the toil of the battle 
 Our enemies fate will reveal 
 And be sealed 
 The chill of the wind keeps on calling our names 
 Theres no turning back now keep hold of the flame 
 Now we are here 
 And there is nothing left to fear 
 The secrets of steel 
 The path of glory will reveal 
 Unchained and free alive forever 
 Legacy of Kings  LEGACY OF KINGSThe gate is closed the sky is burning 
 Dark clouds are closing in 
 A world at war no revelation could help predict a mankind fall 
 Somewhere above the unpolluted skies well be resurrected 
 What have we done We paid the highest price 
 No shelter for the undeserving masses 
 Standing in line for a final journey 
 Into space and beyond 
 A final sigh a breath of hope we gather heed the eternal call 
 Counting the stars we pull the shortest straw life is fading rapidly 
 Nothing remains a withered devils claw 
 Soul survivors picking up the pieces 
 Titan 
 Even the dark has a silver lining 
 Shining bright so far beyond the sun 
 So this is a new beginning 
 So far away so far away 
 We leave the past behind us 
 No turning back no turning back 
 Titan Titan 
 We will fly 
 Were flying into space 
 Fly fly away 
 Were flying into space6 am we still rush along 
 The open road and were feeling strong 
 Another town  HEY  just lay it down down to the ground 
 Only our way or the highway straight to hell 
 Never give up never give in 
 Its your life make it right 
 Our life is not a fashion  Life is Now 
 Pedal to the metal  Life is Now 
 Our life is based on passion 
 And we live our lives the way we want 
 Hit the lights time to bring it on 
 Ten thousand fists they can not be wrong 
 Weve come to slam  HEY the hammer down never lose the game 
 Please come inside do not be afraid aint no requiem 
 Only one way so shout and scream 
 Please take hold of your dream 
 Our life is not a fashion 
 Pedal to the metal 
 Never give up ooh never give in 
 This is your life a thing you cant set asideLight up the candles and open the gate 
 The bell is ringing for the souls with no fate 
 Our little angels all lost in this world 
 Death is transcending they will resurrect 
 Not from their grave but theyve come to collect 
 In danza macabra the dance of the dead 
 We honor the souls we praise the departed 
 Now la calavera catrina is glowing 
 The eyes of the skull bursting into a blaze 
 All of the damned  dia de los muertos 
 All of the damned  los angelitos los inocentes 
 So listen beware remember what they said 
 That life is best enjoyed after death 
 There is a place where the evil can rest 
 Lets draw a circle and take out their nest 
 Into the fire we all been mislead 
 Battle is raging prepare to attack 
 Made out of fire they clobber my back 
 The living and dead in a final ballet 
 Lets summon the dead 
 We all stand together 
 But we thought the spirits 
 Would rest on this day 
 How could we be so blind 
 Stop the dance start the slay 
 That life is best enjoyed after deathIn the distant maze I see two doors 
 One leads to change one leads to where Ive been before 
 I am an angel on broken wings 
 I am the beast the devil and all in between 
 Nothing at all 
 Its never dark here its never light 
 Feeling like Im caught between two worlds 
 Between two worlds 
 When the night comes down the blade comes out 
 I wish I wish I wish I felt something at all 
 Nothings wrong or right nor black or white 
 Behind the hurt I see the lust come shining through 
 What do I do 
 Just like the rainbow between mist and sun 
 Feeling like Im trapped between two worlds 
 Solo Oscar 
 Never laugh or smile I never try 
 My mind is numb and I cant take it anymore 
 Screaming in frustration no sound is heard 
 Am I asleep or am I starring in a dream 
 Please wake me up 
 Sometimes the hunter sometimes the prey 
 Feeling like Im trapped lost and never found 
 Without a homeI I am the one 
 The one who lost control 
 Control but in the end Ill be the 
 Last Man Standing 
 I I am the one 
 The one who sold his soul 
 His soul forever gone to be the 
 Last Man Standing tall 
 Glorious noble in my mind everything a fight to win 
 Taking all and giving whatever my pride would let me 
 Not backing down not giving in 
 I wouldnt lose I couldnt 
 I walk alone with my head held high never felt that I belonged 
 Stand my ground at all costs running through life with blindfolds 
 Just for the right right to be wrong 
 Nothing would rule my world but 
 Control but in the end Id be the 
 Seeing clearer what Ive done 
 Id refuse to let things go 
 I could never once admit Im wrong 
 And what do I have to show 
 Seeing clearer whats at stake 
 And the things I have to change 
 I just hope I can its not too late 
 To get a chance to end this painHe has all the power 
 Of darkness and night 
 Making you believe 
 That evils all right 
 Theres a fire in his eyes 
 He can make you burn 
 From the dead 
 Hell make you return 
 Sell your soul for gold 
 Do as you are told 
 Run with the devil 
 Dont come to me 
 You can take me 
 Filling you with dreams 
 Promising the moon 
 Youll get there very soon 
 Offering you a life 
 Of glory and gold 
 Its really in you 
 To hell I know youre sold 
 Take him to your heart 
 And youll lose your soul 
 Its tearing you apart 
 Taking all control 
 Dreaming of a lie 
 All you get is fear 
 Agony and pain 
 Your end is very near 
 You can take meA battle with pride and ego 
 A journey that started long ago 
 Life time of passion and war 
 Rebel Inside 
 Legends in our lifetime 
 We have our hearts set in the past 
 And eyes towards the future 
 The thunder 5 are riding once again 
 Hell bent on blazing our own trail 
 To seek out fortune and the fame 
 Were warriors warriors 
 Were sick and tired of trying to explain 
 That its a life its not a game 
 The need to be will never wane 
 Rebel Inside rebel for life 
 Well never bend or bow well be 
 Always unbroken cant you see 
 We deal in steel and liberty 
 Were immortalized immortalized 
 Realize its not just how we are 
 Its in our blood to seek the stars 
 The crimson red will take us far 
 A battle with pride and ego 
 Rebel Inside rebel for lifeSight a brand new horizon 
 Ascending from the hearts who couldnt see 
 The decline of man the final stage of war 
 Spectral forces of mankind 
 Were all trapped inside the core of the machine 
 Our time has come to find a way back home 
 We seek our destiny in thee 
 In the eye of the storm 
 A genesis is born reborn 
 Riders of the storm  one with the wind defenders of creation 
 Riders of the storm  aligned with the sun 
 Phantom powers rule the earth 
 Descending down controlling you and me 
 What is left to see is it all but a dream 
 On the inside looking out 
 Kept within a cage behind a false facade 
 They cant keep us down our strength is our will 
 We dream of a genesis reborn 
 Where our spirits fly free 
 Let us choose our own destiny 
 Speak the word of Nemesis 
 Call for thunder call for rain 
 Let us meet our Genesis 
 Save us from the unholy pain 
 Riders of the storm  aligned with the sunLay down your arms this night 
 Surrender to the power 
 Embracing your metal heart 
 On your final walk through the snow 
 A hammer made of steel 
 From the river of blood 
 With magic forged in flames 
 Delusions a curse of the damned 
 What do you see 
 Imaginary visions or reality 
 When youre free 
 Then youll see that you are bound to rule 
 Rule born rule 
 We were born to rule 
 Born to rule born to rule 
 Were born to rule forever more 
 Were born to rule forever 
 The revolution forced us all to heed the final call 
 And if tomorrow never comes 
 Then we will strike the hammer down 
 Forever forever ruleOnce upon a time not far away 
 We all swore the oath to seize the day 
 Moving on at the speed of light 
 Still united undivided 
 Were brothers in arms searching for gold and glory 
 Stay true to your heart come follow heed the call 
 But nothings forever no nothing at all 
 Come inside true templars of the world 
 Raise your voice lets speak for the unheard 
 On and on the story must go on 
 Running free we always will be 
 We are what we are and we always strive for glory 
 Together as one we shine like the sun 
 Beyond the divine were soaring 
 Shining on so glorious the bloodline of true warriors 
 Fighting for the right to be part of the legacy 
 Searching for the rainbows end 
 The gold awaits for you my friend 
 Courage is your guiding star 
 And it will take you far 
 And it will take you farSilence we have sworn 
 The oath protect the earth the sun and moon 
 My precious friends 
 United we stand till the end 
 The vision futures demand 
 Has been written in the palm of our hands 
 When we charge the storm clouds amass 
 Cause the ace of swords will lead on this glorious day 
 Hold your heads high 
 Reach for the sky 
 Never surrender 
 We wont back down 
 The power within 
 Our remedy for sin 
 The true life defenders 
 Battles we have won 
 We bled but never once weve fallen down 
 Form dusk till dawn 
 Standing with our mighty swords drawn 
 The future lies straight ahead 
 Our dreams within reach not mislead 
 We are here true warriors on the line 
 Forever well be the sun in the tarot deck of cards 
 We wont back down we are partners in crime 
 We are true life defenders on earthOutcast a time of war 
 When mankind lost control 
 Of life and death under survaillance 
 I watch the children pray 
 While God just turns away 
 Our in the ruins they seek shelter 
 These streets were once my home 
 But those golden days are gone 
 Now Im fighting to survive 
 Stone cold Stone cold man or machine 
 Stone cold Stone cold the end of our dream 
 The word is on the street 
 Its kill or to be killed 
 With no exception your are on your own 
 We should have seen it all along 
 The writings on the wall 
 Tell me what have we become 
 Stone cold Stone cold the end of our 
 Who do you believe in now 
 When the prophecy came true the final deja vu 
 Stone cold man or machine 
 Stone cold the end of our dreamAlways standing proud we know our time has come 
 Marching off to war the crusade has just begun 
 Fighting for the right to live under the sun 
 We wont stop till theyve lost and weve won 
 Come and fly with us together as one we belong 
 This magic of metal unites us its making us strong 
 Like an arrow we strike  STRONGER THAN ALL 
 Heavy metal troops on the rise 
 Like an arrow of might  STRONGER THAN ALL 
 Well walk through fire were true to ourselves and our lives 
 History commits the oath to deal in steel 
 Warriors of the Faith to no living soul we kneel 
 Born into the fold the Templars are for real 
 No one will ever bring us to heel 
 Shooting through the air at full speed 
 In the name of metal defending our hopes and believes 
 The past and the present unites in us all 
 We stand up for our believes 
 The way of the Templars is here once again 
 Forever they will be free 
 Well walk through fire were true to ourselves 
 In the name of metal defending our hopes and believesThe dragon awakes the guardian waiting around 
 Once touched by fire the flame kissed this dangerous ground 
 Cause by lust the creature slaughtered human race 
 Once defended to become a state of grace 
 We are the Crusaders 
 Bloodred cross caretakers 
 Allied as one known as Stormbreaker 
 In the Dark Ages when mankind gave birth to the beast 
 The demons and wizards united rejected priest 
 All invoked the power of king Lucifer 
 To infuse the power from the crucifer 
 Out of the ashes they summoned the brave to fight back 
 To bring the evil down the best way was sold attack 
 To avoid repeating history once more 
 We must slay the dragon burn his guts and gore 
 Allied as one mighty storm 
 Call out the defender 
 Return the beast to sender 
 Hail to the king known as StormbreakerSilent screaming 
 Youre on your own 
 Balancing on a blade between

 Dont lose your faith dont sit there in silence 
 Show your strength lets hail the metal gods bare your heart 
 All for one our burning hearts will live forever 
 One for all together standing strong 
 Hammerfall we will prevail

 We share a dream the future is ours 
 A metal heart is hard to tear apart heed the call 
 A flash of light calls out the providers 
 We run this race but we will never crawl all hail Hammerfall 
 Just follow your heart dont listen to the crowd 
 The wisdom the voice is calling from inside 
 The time long forgotten will soon come again 
 Prepare for the meeting the gods of metal reignMy guard is down accept my invitation 
 But dont waste my time with your slandern lies 
 Cause my dream is my dream 
 All based on my revelations 
 Extreme but not mean 
 And Ill stand the test of time 
 You say you like me youre my friend 
 But I got stabbed in the back 
 Removed that smile and wash the blood off your hands 
 I Refuse I Refuse 
 You call my name but you dont know me 
 You say Im insane but whos to blame 
 Cause Ill scream and Ill scream 
 And Im building up a reputation 
 I esteem by all means 
 Cause I swin against the stream 
 You turn the page and write 
 The story of a life you dont know 
 My tongue is sharp and mightier than your pen 
 Refuse to be something that Im not 
 Refuse to be something that Im notDo you remember how we used to say 
 Everything around us is made of clay 
 We were the Kings and the others the fools 
 Playing by our rules 
 Adorned with golden shapes and silver dreams 
 You count the seconds every moment seems 
 Like your lost to the stars up above 
 Even though youre falling 
 Spoken words made of trust burning bridges between us 
 Turning diamonds into rust 
 Youre running out of time the higher that you climb 
 The deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all 
 Out of time on the line 
 Living In Victory 
 You spread your words I say devoid of truth 
 Whats left is fantasy of endless youth 
 You made a promise a little white lie 
 Now youre falling from the sky 
 Chasing dragons by the moon burning bridges around you 
 Your deepest fears begin to loom 
 Is it someone that hears you is it somebody there 
 All you know and all you will get lie so deep down inside 
 Dreams of fortune in the dust when all your bridges are burnt 
 Turning being into lust 
 Living in sin 
 Out of time the higher that you climb 
 Living In VictoryGaze upon the stake 
 Flames will soon start to embrace 
 Condemned auto da fé 
 Shes about to fall from grace 
 In the land of the rising sun 
 Shadows are falling again 
 The die is cast the future and past 
 Coming to her at last 
 Oh oh oh 
 All she needed was a Champion 
 Crying for a saviour to fight for her life 
 Behold the freedom cries 
 By the dying of the light 
 Too late to justify 
 For vindication upon this night 
 From out of nowhere a rider declared 
 To answer her final prayer 
 He stood up to be the Champion 
 He became the saviour that fought for her life 
 Face to face eye to eye 
 The saviour fought to save her pride 
 Far beyond the starlit skies the encounter went on 
 Gaze upon the stake 
 As the flames start to embrace 
 A life an act of faith 
 Longlost gone without a trace 
 The die is cast for the future and past 
 Came for her at last 
 Crying for a saviour to fight for her 
 He became the saviour that fought for her lifeHeed the war cry for glory 
 Hear them calling your name 
 Hold your ground show no mercy 
 For freedom in anger now maim 
 Another angel is dying  Falling 
 His entry to heaven denied  Falling from the skies 
 Predestined to walk and fend in the darkness  Fortune 
 Reveal the gates of hell  Hex Immortalized 
 The fallen they walk all among us  Angels 
 Their broken wings will not bear  Angels in disguise 
 Eternal dawn in torment anguish  Dawning 
 Bound to stagger this land  Hex Immortal 
 We walk the line we stand alone eternally 
 Were crused to live we cannot die 
 Immortalized 
 Time goes by now the angels 
 Feed the eternal flame 
 Stand your ground cursed immortal 
 The hex is now stuck to your nameYouve been fighting for much to long 
 You saw the future and what to come 
 Restless spirits out on the run 
 Among the shadows of the sun 
 You are the rising resistance now 
 Weve come to show you a way somehow 
 Beyond the past and in secrecy 
 We found it all but we want more 
 We come from the age of chivalry 
 Metal machines unchained and free 
 We are here for you to see 
 Flying on wings of steel thundering we are breaking the seal 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn to spread the word of a Legend Reborn 
 Moving silent like a gentle breeze 
 The troops of metal and we do as we please 
 We are the restless we are the vile 
 Burning hearts that never die 
 We are going against the tide 
 The hammer has fallen a thorn in your side 
 Break the silence or take the fall 
 The mighty Templars will take it all 
 Welcome the age of chivalry 
 Were we all will be set free 
 Its the time for you and me 
 Sons and brothers fight or fall 
 With our sisters and daughters 
 Were standing one for all 
 Fighting for the oath we sworn to spread the word of a Legend RebornWhen the sky is turning black you fear the dawn 
 Your inner voice compels you but youre all alone 
 Thy secret sense lies still obscure within your shattered dreams 
 And all you can do is scream 
 Long ago you spoke the words of heresy 
 Twenty years of running brings back memories 
 All your wisdom made me seek the truth that lied beyond 
 My inner dreams 
 Follow the one that fell from the crimson skies 
 I remember the words I can never forget your demise 
 And now your worlds falling down 
 For all the games that you played 
 And as your souls falling down 
 Youll meet The Unforgiving Blade 
 Should have seen it coming 
 When you rolled the dice 
 Deeper and deeper falling 
 Away from your paradise 
 Innocent eyes observing the Crimson Skies 
 Awaiting for someone to heal the burning lies 
 The Unforgiving Blade Unforgiving BladeLivin in a shadow

 I found a place where nothings what it seems

 The urge to kill is getting stronger

 Surrender your soul 
 Surrender your pride 
 Please enter my dream

 Cause your rebirth is near 
 The bat awakens deep inside

 And when the darkness comes around 
 I come alive cause for your sweet blood I am bound 
 I taste your blood so bitter sweet 
 Come ease my pain get on your knees 
 You know true love is meant to be 
 Forever is now what it seems

 Solo Stephan 
 Cause your rebirth is nearHear the screams from down below 
 The cry of the raven the demons and wizards 
 In league with the dark 
 Feed the fire nourish the flames 
 The hammer is pounding the steel in its grace 
 By via crucis embraced 
 Born out of wedlock the spirit is lost 
 Ordeal of ingestion the way of the cross 
 Oh its 
 Tainted metal 
 No return nowhere to go 
 The wands of the wizards call demons to fetter 
 Their heart broken souls 
 Face the fire defiling the steel 
 The blood of the heathens their guts and their gore 
 Weakens the sword to the core 
 Born out of wedlock the future came fast 
 Trial by fire iconoclast 
 Blackens the power of steel 
 Ordeal of ingestion ordeal of the cross 
 Oh 
 Tainted metalLong before these walls will come down 
 The king rejected his crown 
 All blasphemers stood in line 
 To spread their gospel and lies 
 But a wind of change came in from the past 
 The legendary 
 Templars of steel  We came here to win 
 Never will kneel  We never give in 
 This is our deal  The future n past 
 Built to Last 
 Solid backbones cast in steel

 This is our deal  The hearts beating fast 
 Built to LastUndying nightfall a king with no crown 
 Dethroned imprisoned in chains 
 Duel the black horse the Swordsmen must kneel 
 Condemned to serve within the shadows 
 Putem next to their King 
 Out of the fire and into the night 
 A handful of brave men appeared 
 Crimson thunder running through their veins 
 A bond that will last forever 
 Nothings stronger than  
 Brothers in arms are fighting tonight 
 The Forces of steel meet again 
 Born in the fire they look to the sky 
 Power of metal unchained 
 Time has come break out of these chains 
 FIGHT proud for your kingdom 
 Behind the defenders the king marches on 
 By divine intervention 
 They are fighting with  
 The Forces of Steel live again 
 The power of metal unchained 
 Past many nights they fought on 
 And by the moonlight the battle was won 
 But still the black horse is running 
 Knowing were the power will lead 
 The power of metal unchainedThe moon is full you cannot see 
 Theres something in the air 
 Sound asleep youre in too deep 
 Protecting your own lair 
 The lion roar into the night 
 Yet another foe to slay 
 Who are you that I see right through 
 The hunter or the prey 
 Too late to hear the final warning 
 No one can defy the reaper 
 Voices  twisted 
 Calling out your name 
 Calling for you 
 Aint no reason for the rhyme 
 Take the black ready to attack 
 Take the black 
 Face to face you bide your time 
 You though you had it all in there 
 In your little bag of tricks 
 Insanity wont set you free 
 As you cross the river Styx 
 Youre out of time your bridges burn 
 In the undying flame 
 Well nail you down to the ground 
 For you to bear the shame 
 Take the black ready to attackThey search the desert plains 
 In the land of no return 
 To seek out the danger time to burn 
 They are the rightous ones 
 Theyve come to claim this land 
 Like warriors under command 
 They fight for gold and glory 
 Proclaim the dead mans land 
 Into the dungeons they must go 
 To find the answers left untold 
 Under the burning sun 
 In danger eye to eye 
 They all now that someone must die 
 Into the well theyre falling 
 Past immortality 
 Led by temptation and devotion 
 Rendered deathless by the touch of the sword 
 Onwards victory let us hear your battle cry 
 The enemies will renounce or die 
 Hail the Warriors Of Faith 
 Together they march through the fire 
 Forever theyre lost in this world 
 Eternally they will fall under the sign 
 Of victory fighting all for one 
 Hail the the Warriors Of FaithIm a wheel Im a wheel 
 I can roll I can feel 
 And you cant stop me turning 
 Cause Im the sun Im the sun

 Come down with fire 
 And lift my spirit higher 
 Someones screaming my name

 The black and the white 
 Im the man on the silver mountainThe war still remains 
 No Kingdom on earth 
 Theres only pure evil indifference to birth 
 In the tombs of the dead 
 One man breeds alone 
 The unearthly warfare shadows the throne 
 Three temptations written down 
 The Lust of flesh lust of the eye 
 Finally the pride of life 
 The Demon Twelve the hell hounds 
 My name is Legion for we are many spirits inside of one 
 To build a land of chaos brought forth from the Abyss 
 My name is Legion and we bring destruction and death 
 Possessing his soul 
 The curse of the damned 
 A tormented victim to the bottom hes slammed 
 One man stands alone 
 Trapped under a spell 
 Encounter your demons send them to Hell 
 No temptations left to fend 
 Sanctified Anti Christ 
 Casting shadows towards the cross 
 My name is Legion and we bring destruction and deathWell make it 
 Been fighting for so long dont know which way up is 
 Been stuck and ripped and burnt till it feels like nothin 
 Our time will come and when its over and its done 
 Those fools are gonna know that we aint bluffin 
 Were gonna make it 
 Well reach the top 
 And then were never gonna stop 
 The power of the people aint been showin 
 Its never what you know its who youre knowin 
 Sure it aint right but as the saying goes its might 
 That decides who stays behind and wholl be goin 
 Solo  Jay Jay 
 All right all right were gonna make it 
 Come on boys come on boys 
 Aint gonna stop until we drop 
 Oh oh 
 Let it rock let it roll 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
 Here we go babyArose from the ashes the remains of a time set aside 
 The warrior of Eden found by honor these two words collide 
 On and on and on with glory he came he saw he conquered 
 He gathered his armies true he leads across the Templars of steel 
 They sought out the dragon made the enemy bleed made them kneel 
 On and on and on a legend unbent unbowed unbroken 
 On and on and on a story is born a legacy reborn 
 Hammer high to the sky 
 Follow the warrior and king 
 Call of Hectors Hymn 
 Hammer high Hammer high amplify 
 Hail to the warrior 
 Along came the thunder and the hero was set to return 
 We haunt you by fire our spirit is now set to burn 
 On and on and on the fire and the flame will burn forever 
 Still guarded by Templars all the secrets of steel will remain 
 Cause we are the keepers and for us this is real not a game 
 On and on and on we follow this need we came we conquered 
 On and on and on together we fight together we will fall 
 Call of Hectors 
 Call of Hectors HymnIn a time of fear and confusion 
 Silence charging the air 
 The sunlight is gone darkness lives on 
 In the heart of the dragons lair 
 Lost in a world of illusions 
 No trace of the missing ore 
 Stealing our souls were out of control 
 Knocking at deaths door 
 All our beliefs fading into ashes 
 Heed the words that we pray 
 For a Heros Return our hearts still yearn 
 Rise and conquer let the infidels burn 
 Now we charge the battle is raging 
 Blood runs everywhere 
 Our anger is fierce avenging the years 
 No time for a final prayer 
 Behold the might of the hammer 
 Elliptical bolts of fire 
 Theres nowhere to run nowhere to hide 
 Youre down to the wire 
 Somewhere out there lies a new tomorrow 
 For me and those who believe 
 Ooh Ooh Ooh 
 Now Ive returned from a place far beyond 
 My mission I set let it be done 
 We still believe in a brighter future 
 The dreams are ours to fulfill 
 Rise and conquer let the infidels burnIts getting closer now 
 The clock strikes midnight time 
 It is the tolling of the judgment bell 
 You fear the dead of night 
 There aint no place to hide 
 This is your point of no return 
 Now we are ready to strike again 
 Its getting far too late my friend 
 Let The Hammer Fall 
 We are above the law 
 Let our power show 
 That were in full control of your destiny 
 Were getting closer now 
 The chill of distant eyes 
 Your on a dead end street into the night 
 Let the Hammer FallRide 
 They came at dawn 
 Into the morning light 
 Black shadows ridin on the mist 
 Prepared for battle 
 Swords were shinin bright 
 Filled with anger and harm 
 Came to kill not to charm 
 The sound of metal 
 Screamin in the air 
 The time has come where justice rules 
 The endless victims 
 Looking up in fear 
 Now who were the fools 
 Oh here they come 
 Riders of the sun 
 And they will fight 
 Back to back  back to back 
 Theyre fighting hard 
 Their way of victory 
 Dead bodies lying on the ground 
 They are the soldiers of eternity 
 And their swords spinnin around 
 Theyre fightin with power ready to ride let go 
 They got it all 
 Theyll never fall 
 But they will fight 
 The night is fallin 
 Light will disappear 
 A magic silence fills the place 
 Could read the warning 
 Shinin crystal clear 
 Now they were lost for the chase 
 No  no  no  noCountdown descending down to zero 
 Bursting into flames 
 Cant you see the coming of a hero 
 On this enchanting day 
 So stand up and be counted 
 In the solar glance in the desert sand 
 No longer the hunted 
 United we are till the day we fall 
 A chain unbreakable 
 Every link is allied to our mighty vow 
 Were blood bound we aim for the sun 
 The luminous moon will take us high over ground 
 Were blood bound collecting the stars 
 We hold a power that is greater than all 
 Were blood bound 
 Watch out the heathens all around us 
 Always watch your back 
 Weve got a lust for freedom 
 Whatever they say we know well stay 
 We are indestructible 
 And no matter what happens we will rise above 
 Look into my eyes 
 Tell me what is hidden deep inside 
 Chains about to break 
 Its the everlasting freedom for us all 
 We hold a power together 
 We hold a power together blood bound 
 Power forever blood bound power 
 Were blood boundA flash in the night a journey through time 
 The Templars are back on the streets 
 Guarded by prowess and the will to survive 
 All led by the guiding light 
 Angels of mercy guardians of time 
 Shackled and chained through the eternal flame 
 The hammer will slowly arise 
 Heeding the call one and for all 
 Never surrender with glory well fall 
 Brothers unite lets stand up and fight 
 Fulfilling our fate we are 
 Heeding the call 
 One step ahead revealing the past 
 United together we stand 
 The call of the thunder the sign to begin 
 This final crusade we will win 
 Angels of mercy our journey must proceed 
 With hearts all filled up with chivalry 
 The lifeblood that we all need 
 Brothers unite let stand up and fight 
 Fulfilling our fate we are heeding the call 
 Fulfilling our fate we are heeding the callSee the light of those who find 
 As time pass you by youre still left behind 
 Time has come for you to see 
 That life is a game youd rather play or flee 
 The ivory gates cast shadows might betray 
 Surrender this night or choose my way 
 Come with me Ill take you there 
 To the land of make believe 
 Let us fly beyond our dreams fall into reverie 
 On the wings of destiny I will claim our liberty 
 With the power of the steel 
 Dreamland will reveal 
 All you see is black or white 
 You have to spell out whats wrong or right 
 Spoken words may have let you down 
 Its time to stand up and rise with the sun 
 You entered the gates and theres nothing left to fear 
 But dont let the matter stand youre near 
 Let me know if you wanna go theres a place for you and me 
 Let me take you to the temple of your heart let me know 
 Dreamland will revealStanding alone its the ultimate proving ground 
 As real as it gets we are soldiers of oneman armies 
 Burning inside hear the audience scream 
 Weve got a yearning inside to fulfill our destiny 
 The lights go down no more fears 
 The crowd goes wild music to our ears 
 Get it on 
 Lets get it on  It on 
 Come on get it on  It on 
 Come on get it on 
 Nowhere to run like an animal caged and cornered 
 Standing so proud its the life we have chosen 
 We do what We were bred to do were trained to do 
 We live to do what we were born to do 
 Pulled from the ashes and forged from tradition 
 The essence of power behold demolition 
 Are you ready 
 Are you ready  Get 
 Are you ready  It 
 I said are you ready  On 
 Lets get it on 
 Come on get it on 
 Come on get it on 
 Come on get it onRising forces thunder in the east 
 No fearless warrior could subdue the beast 
 No gallant man around could stand and hold his ground 
 Days passed by and weeks turned into years 
 Every drip of hope became a sea of fears 
 Somewhere in the dark a light or just a spark 
 Brothers in arms fighting one for all 
 Fearless and wild we stand tall one of a kind 
 No turning back brothers fight or fall 
 Standing together we fight one of a kind 
 Years of darkness all torn by fates hand 
 A nation cursed once glorious and grand 
 From the ashes we will rise like a phoenix to the skies 
 Come take my hand dont leave me here all alone 
 Come make a stand dont let us all fade away fade away 
 1666  we stood in the valley of death 
 Steel in our hands the final command 
 To cure and to heal our nation 
 Mighty warriors  mount up dont stare at the ground 
 Hold your heads high resist and defy 
 Fighting defending were screaming avenging you all 
 Were standing all for one for all 
 One voice were one of a kind we are 
 Never look back never surrender 
 Were fighting all for one for all 
 One heart were one of a kind we are 
 Cause we are here and we are fighting 
 One of a kindYou see me but Im not there 
 Like the calm before the storm 
 You hear me Im everywhere 
 In the wind and in the rain 
 Feel me in every breeze 
 Im the chill inside your spine 
 Im burning you start to freeze 
 As you slowly turn around 
 And down in your hole 
 Solitary darkness rule 
 You are forlorn 
 Cause justice will be mine 
 Prowling the night 
 Justice calling well track you down 
 Justice calling ready to strike 
 Justice calling breaking the chains 
 Hammer of justice seeking his revenge 
 Dead man walking by 
 Theres a void inside his eyes 
 Judgement a final sigh 
 Hear the screams electrified 
 As the mirror turns blank 
 And your essence fades away 
 Your chapters closed 
 Sealed with thunderbolts 
 Strike with the hammer of justice 
 I see injustice everywhere I go 
 I search for tomorrow and I know you will be there 
 The hammer of justice holds the key to the future 
 The bringer of sorrow is the last youll see 
 Justice callingIs it too late to go in peace I wonder how 
 How these things did start anyway 
 Maybe too late to find a way when the 
 Trail of grief is marked with memories 
 Now when youre gone the warmth 
 Of the sun seems so faraway 
 I believe  in everything I see every 
 Second is a miracle for me 
 I believe  after sunshine comes the 
 Rain and when its pouring down 
 The only thing I feel is pain 
 I walk alone through shapeless dreams 
 My only home is the wasteland that I cross 
 I close the door and turn the key 
 Those days of joy are barely memories 
 Now when youre gone your star will 
 Shine on wont you shine for me 
 The only thing I feel is painSomewhere in the alley 
 A shot inside the dark 
 The gutters paved in blackened blood 
 By the godless patriarch 
 You hear the thunder howlin 
 You fear his glowing eyes 
 A bang across the universe 
 As the lightning hits the skies 
 Fear the sound of metal 
 The clash when steel meets steel 
 Were renegades lets regulate 
 Lets finish this ordeal 
 We are defenders the almighty 
 We stomp the trail where no one dares to go 
 We are the brave lets keep on fighting 
 Protect the sacred vow 
 Trapped into a corner 
 Silence fills the air 
 The dark abandoned city streets 
 Is now the dragons lair 
 A scream across the heavens 
 A sound to heed the call 
 Protectors of the universe 
 Ready to play ball 
 The sweetest sound of all 
 Were flying high up in the sky 
 A mighty fireball 
 The first cut spilled blood in the gutter 
 The second cut blinded his eyes 
 The third cut gave us all the answers 
 The final cut sliced up his lies 
 Protect the sacred vowStanding at the 
 Crossroads were the future meets the past 
 Oh cant you feel theres magic in the air 
 Were noble knights and mighty men with the 
 Power to assay 
 Faithful and true let our deeds show you the way 
 Glorious we live and we die 
 Our courage will unite 
 In our hands we hold the future carry on 
 In our hearts eternally we Keep The Flame 
 Burning 
 Hear the sound of roaring thunder and the 
 Sound of raging steel 
 In the battle of thrust our sprits will reveal 
 Glorious wed rather die 
 With honour than to live with shame 
 In our hearts eternally we keep the flame 
 Burning deep inside forever shining on 
 And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The 
 Flame Burning 
 We stay as we are now the first crusade is won 
 Let it be written let it be done 
 Flame BurningIcy water on my hands 
 The roar of thunder everywhere 
 I close my eyes I realize 
 Im far away from home 
 In the Twilight Zone the shadows mourn 
 Out of the night came the shining  
 The Metal Age 
 Ivory towers conceal my eyes 
 Caught up in a long lost time 
 Where no one speaks at liberty 
 They guard their destiny 
 To forge the steel they will reveal 
 Im falling into the breach 
 Im a stranger in this land Im falling 
 Standing strong the brave and the elder 
 With scars seldom forgotten above it all 
 Come with us offering shelter 
 From the icy wind that shiver 
 Come with us to the twilight zone oh yeah 
 Youre welcome to the Metal Age 
 Hear the bell begin to chime 
 The moonlit skies burst out in flames 
 The time has come it must be done 
 Let the power be unchained 
 By the force within let the war begin 
 The Metal AgeWe saw the writings on the wall 
 When heathens ruled above us all 
 Tormented we still heard the call 
 You come to bring us down 
 Wield the scepter steal the crown 
 Time on the throne is running out 
 Cause seasons change but we are still the same 
 Even though the cold winds blow the fire burns inside 
 Hearts on fire hearts on fire 
 Burning burning with desire 
 Burning for the steel 
 Hearts on fire 
 For years shunned by society 
 Outcasts condemned for our beliefs 
 Our legions grew in secrecy 
 And now the time is here 
 I see the Templars everywhere 
 The freedom call is drawing near 
 We hold our rebel banners up with pride 
 The colours crimson and the hammer is the sign 
 Hearts on fire hearts on fire 
 Burning burning with desireJag blev fångad i mörker jag såg inget ljus 
 Fast allt runt omkring stod i brand 
 I lågornas sken fanns mitt hopp och min tro 
 Som virvlade bort och försvann 
 Så ge mig min styrka ge mig kraft att försvara mitt land 
 Ge mig en väg att gå jag ser yxan i krigarens hand 
 Vill ni att jag vänder om och slåss för den jag är 
 Aldrig sviker jag mitt land 
 När vindarna viskar mitt namn 
 Mitt namn 
 Och regnet som föll det fick dölja min sorg 
 Och släcka min brinnande törst 
 Jag flydde till bergen när gryningen kom 
 Och plötsligt jag hörde en röst 
 Vindarna viskar jag hör hur dom kallar mitt namn 
 Jag har en väg att gå jag ser yxan i krigarens hand 
 Vindarna viskar mitt namnI wont pull the trigger 
 Just to see you die 
 No remedy to make me come alive 
 Im ticking like a timebomb 
 Need no fuse just guts and gore 
 To initiate the burning of the core 
 I count down to zero pull the trigger no parole 
 No mercy have mercy no mercy on your soul 
 Kill by any means necessary 
 Win by any means necessary 
 Live by any means necessary 
 Die by any means necessary 
 I am not judgemental 
 A sinner nor a saint 
 Cause either youre my best friend or you aint 
 Come gather here around me 
 Feel my breath under your skin 
 Im deadly only when Im getting caught 
 I count down to zero Im a soldier without soul 
 I am born to kill  judge and condemn 
 I am born to win  slay and maim em 
 I am born to live  fight for glory 
 I am born to die 
 Kill  win  live  die 
 I am born to die  memento mori 
 I am born to die  memento moriAs I wake up from my slumber 
 From a deep enchanted sleep 
 Theres a pain theres a mark 
 Theres a wound 
 The trail of blood is running deep 
 Theres an echo in the mirror 
 Of a man I do not know 
 Staring back at the scar 
 On my neck 
 And the numbers are 
 Screaming 
 Six Six Six 
 Grab the holy crucifix 
 Skies turned red 
 High above the river Styx 
 Kneeling down in desperation 
 As I start to speak in tongues 
 When I praise the 
 Old man down below 
 I recite the mantra 
 Twist the holy crucifix 
 Grab the oars 
 Scull across the river Styx 
 Its the evil in me 
 The Enemy Within my soul 
 The subjagtor 
 Get the holy crucifix 
 Throw it in 
 Into Acheron or Styx 
 Sinking like a ton of bricks 
 Oneway pass 
 Over Acheron and Styx 
 The subjagtorHoo my little pretty one my pretty one

 Hooooooohhh my Sharona

 It seems so hard to carry on 
 When you hear a voice 
 From long ago so bittersweet 
 Even though I try I can not 
 Read between the lines 
 You know I tried 
 Oh yes I tried whats wrong 
 Too late to turn back time 
 To look over my shoulder 
 Maybe one day Ill return again 
 Remember Yesterday 
 And think about tomorrow 
 But you have to live today 
 Oh lonely yesterday 
 Dont leave me with the sorrow 
 Cause I have to live today 
 Every morning I awake 
 To see the newborn day 
 To carry on the flame 
 Until the end of time 
 Oh oh oh dont you step aside 
 And pretend about the future 
 Oh oh oh never live a lie 
 Dont you know tomorrow never comes 
 Dont you know tomorrow never comesYour words of slander wont take us down 
 We see right through you a shattered clown 
 We walk the walk and we talk the talk 
 Well back it up if you wanna rock 
 Wanna rock 
 Well give you action to back these words 
 Well write the songs that are still unheard 
 And at the down of the new crusade 
 Youre at a standstill beneath the blade 
 No matter what theyll say 
 Forever we march our own way 
 Were in this together were fighting to win 
 For better or worse by the virtue of sin 
 Bring It  Just Bring It 
 You cast your spell with a serpents tongue 
 Through rage and fire you walk among 
 Your tainted magic we see right through 
 Time to retreat from our point of view 
 Come join our mighty parade 
 The future is ours to invade 
 Cause you heard the warnings the reason our cause 
 GYDU this is our call to arms 
 Time to step down from your throne 
 Free of sin Please cast the first stone 
 Just Bring ItCharge into the vein 
 Like a needle for the pain 
 Thunderbolts clashing down 
 A new sound across the land 
 Force we are the pawns 
 Conveying a new dawn 
 Hear the screams feel the force 
 In a symphony of steel 
 Across the universe 
 Embracing all mankind 
 Theres something in our hearts worth fighting for 
 Some Secrets better left untold 
 And when the time has come for us to die 
 Well take the Secrets to the grave 
 No here they stand 
 The resistance hand in hand 
 When you think we are gone 
 We will rise a brand new dawn 
 Charge hear the screams 
 Its the fear of the unseen 
 Force no remorse 
 Its a symphony of steel 
 You cant break a metal heart 
 And its far too wild to tame 
 Well take the Secrets to the graveOut of the darkness the voices are calling 
 Riding the wings of a song 
 The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling 
 I feel it coming on strong 
 The lightning strikes cracking the night 
 It feels like never before 
 Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark 
 I hear a rising force 
 Searching my soul now I find something else 
 I take my life in my hands 
 Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell 
 The power is at my command 
 The lightning strikes cracking the night 
 Im not the same anymore 
 I feel a rising force 
 Burned by the glory of a sacred fire 
 The rising force starts to shine 
 A burning inferno it soars ever higher 
 Leaving the demons behind 
 I feel a rising forceWords unspoken sworn in secrecy 
 A burning flame for the ones who believe 
 The prophecy 
 Revelations from the sun as of the moon 
 In seven nights we became history 
 On a cold dark night 
 We set our sails to search for land so far away 
 Searching for the truth 
 Theres a howl in the wind 
 On this mystic trail of water we sail on 
 The source of youth 
 And the storm breaks loose on the seven seas 
 Tag on the signs on the mounting sun 
 Northern light is shining on for us 
 Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow 
 Setting the sails into the future 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrows 
 From the mountain side 
 Came a twisted wind it brought us new insight 
 Whispering these words 
 Come in the midst youll see 
 Said a voice I thought it was the prophecy 
 The secrecy unheard 
 And on the violent sea theres tranquillity 
 We saw the signs on the mountain side 
 A secret passage never to be found 
 In front of us a delusion of sight 
 From the mountains and the rivers down below 
 A silent breeze theres a wail in the wind 
 Weve come from a land so far away 
 We bow down to the words you pray 
 Storming down the mountain side 
 No place to go no place to hide 
 Here we stand under of cover the moonlight 
 Oh the prophecy was bound to fail 
 Here we are nowhere to be found 
 Were trapped in another world and the journeys just begun 
 Ah ah ah 
 Leave all your fears and your sorrowsLed by temptation into the underworld 
 To absence of season and time 
 Soldiers of Fortune Soldiers of the Night 
 Back to back ready to fight 
 Enchanted gardens where Evil slipped away 
 Through darkness fire and rage 
 Uncanny demons will dance upon your grave 
 As soon as you become their slave 
 Surrender or fight theres nowhere to turn 
 The Bringer of Light where are you now 
 Forever our hearts will burn 
 Immortal Riders Protectors of the Earth 
 Lost in the abode of the dead 
 Misled through darkness and mislead by desire 
 Inside the midst of the fire 
 Fallen Angels arise from your graves 
 Free your spirits and unite 
 Before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night 
 From the ruins of hell we shall rise 
 On The Edge Of Honour we see the light 
 Of the Unicorn soaring the night 
 Lead both 
 Born to conquer the fight 
 Here we stand with the Future in our hands 
 Through fire well rise to touch the sky 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Seeker of danger is turning to withdraw 
 Our journey has come to an end 
 Lets stand together put trust in thy sword 
 Victory will marching toward 
 Lead bothAs long as I remember 
 Weve marched across this land 
 Oh oh 
 Reached for a new horizon 
 Pulled by the killing hand 
 All fed up with lies 
 The time has come 
 To break these chains and fly 
 Here we stand bound forever more 
 Than out of this world until the end 
 Here we are mighty glorious 
 At the end of the rainbow 
 With gold in our hands 
 We know the treasures lies 
 Beyond the pouring rain 
 Our quest will last forever 
 For you its all the same 
 No one can deny 
 Our futures set 
 To reach above the sky 
 Lets fly away through the rain 
 Fly high to ease the burning pain 
 Oh the colours fading out 
 The light is shining in the night 
 Its up to you its worth the fight 
 Search before the colours fade 
 With gold in our handsFrom our lives beginning on 
 We are pushed in little forms 
 No one asks us how we like to be 
 In school they teach you what to think 
 But everyone says different things 
 But theyre all convinced that 
 Theyre the ones to see 
 So they keep talking and they never stop 
 And at a certain point you give it up 
 So the only thing thats left to think is this 
 I want outto live my life alone 
 I want outleave me be 
 I want outto do things on my own 
 I want outto live my life and to be free 
 People tell me A and B 
 They tell me how I have to see 
 Things that I have seen already clear 
 So they push me then from side to side 
 Theyre pushing me from black to white 
 Theyre pushing till theres nothing more to hear 
 But dont push me to the maximum 
 Shut your mouth and take it home 
 Cause I decide the way things gonna be 
 Theres a million ways to see the things in life 
 A million ways to be the fool 
 In the end of it none of us is right 
 Sometimes we need to be alone 
 No no no leave me alone 
 I want outMany times this story has been told 
 A legendary tale a fable brave and bold 
 Now your blood begins to boil 
 Turn the crank of all the toil 
 Raise your fist and yell born again 
 Live Life Loud 
 Caught up in a maze nowhere to go 
 Suppressed by powers 
 Endless deep of pain and woe 
 Come on break your inner chains 
 Feel the power in your veins 
 Raise your fist and cry out loud born again 
 Live Life LoudSnow keeps falling down 
 From grace in the dark 
 Frozen tears in silent cries 
 Sadness now color the battle field 
 All around life is passing by 
 Falling from my eyes 
 Like a raindrop from the skies 
 So Send me a Sign 
 Just a way to explain 
 Tell me what I can do 
 Im turning insane 
 Show me what I should do 
 Only one wish to tell 
 A word sincerely signed just for you 
 Winter paved my way couldnt see nor believe 
 I watched the snow highlighting my grief 
 Sadness I long for the sun to shine 
 Please melt the ice wrapped around my heart 
 Send me a Sign 
 A word sincerely signed just for youScreaming and twisting 
 Hes pounding his sword to the ground 
 A soul made of fire 
 A heart made of solid steel fear the sound 
 Guided by courage 
 The fear of eternal disgrace 
 The spirits of daring 
 The trail of his life brought fail to embrace 
 Trapped in the corner hell or paradise 
 Forever failure or selfsacrifice 
 Im a warrior I am 
 In the rising sun I stand 
 My true colours shining bright 
 Inside aeonian flames 
 Winding and turning 
 Hes seeking a path to survive 
 The hunters the hunted 
 The spectre within will soon come alive 
 The spirit of bearing by seven diverges unite 
 Never surrender be ready to kill 
 When killing is right 
 Shame and dishonor the wrath of the sword 
 Beyond all bearings the honor restored 
 Im a soldier under command 
 In the setting sun Ill carry on 
 The code of the warrior soul 
 Honour courage and rectitude 
 Tempered by ancient wisdom 
 One law one life in solitude 
 Live by the code die by the sword 
 This is the wayWe saw the lights go down 
 The falling of the crown 
 The infidels dethroned 
 Climbing up from their darkened abode 
 Your pious words wont mend 
 Youre not from heaven sent 
 Youre holierthanthou 
 To the swords to the guns we must go 
 And so here we stand 
 Were the soldiers of the promised land 
 We are here so please leave us be 
 Were fighting to live to be free 
 New breed old breed 
 We are all the same breed 
 Heavy Metal running through our veins 
 You say we are the same 
 But who you are to blame 
 Our mighty swords wont rust 
 When your hearts made of stone turns to dust 
 Youre not the chosen ones 
 Youre second to the guns 
 Your deeds are bound to fail 
 Better find you own path your own trail 
 Were the brethren of the promised land 
 We are free to follow our dreams 
 Protecting our lives by all means 
 Warriors  Hold your heads high 
 Glorious  High in the sky 
 The fire burns  Deep down inside 
 Glory for us nothing for thee 
 Heavy Metal running through our 
 Running through our veinsI saw your face in the morning sun 
 Oh I thought you were there 
 I heard your voice as the wind passed me by 
 Silently whispering my name 
 So many things that I wanted to say 
 Forever left untold 
 I still remember the tears that you shed 
 Over someone else 
 Our love could never die 
 All I can do is cry 
 Save a little prayer for the fallen one 
 There is a light down at memory lane 
 Slowly fading away 
 Still holding on to the dreams torn apart 
 I will follow my heart 
 Still on my own chasing the sun 
 Of a time long ago 
 The shade in my heart tearing apart 
 Everything that I long for 
 Guitar Interlude 
 I saw your face in the morning sun 
 Mhispering my name 
 Ooh yeahWe are the voices in the dark 
 Inside the fire we are the 
 Eternal Spark that will guide the way 
 We are the stars up in sky 
 We gather winds so you can fly 
 We are the light when youre sleeping 
 All your dreams can come true 
 Where do we go 
 Were just a heartbeat away 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder 
 We will stay by your side 
 Let our voices be there to guide you 
 We are forces in the rain 
 Inside your heart we are the 
 Unending answer to all your fears 
 So take a step towards the light 
 The crimson sky fulfills the night 
 The revelation is near 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder 
 All your dreams can come true 
 Follow the signs of the Crimson ThunderThundering down from the mountain you ride 
 Clutching a sword made of steel

 Living for all and for one Shining into the night you 
 Are riding Through the darkness and light you are 
 Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the

 Hide Into their midst you will run A face from the 
 Grave is the last thing theyll see And die with your 
 Name on their tongue many were at your command

 Hand Living for all and for one Shining into the night

 Clutching a sword made of steel The ones you call 
 Friends they all left you for dead Alone on the
