I'm in a movie where boy meets girl 
 What happens to me in this brave new world? 
 Do I listen to my heart, do I listen to my head? 
 Do I look at what I see, or remember what I read? 
 When I tell you how I feel, do I wonder what I've said? 
 Is there nothing we can do about it? 
 Anyone 
 Anyone can be so hard-hearted 
 But everyone 
 Still everybody wants a happy ending 
 It's not so easy, it's '84 now 
 How tough must we be to ask for more now? 
 Do I listen to my head, do I listen to my heart? 
 Do I try to feel the same as I feel when we're apart? 
 Do I think about the end when it's only just the start? 
 Is there nothing we can do about it? 
 Anyone 
 Anyone can be so hard-hearted 
 But everyone 
 Still everybody wants a happy ending 
 I get so scared when I see the evidence against our case 
 Each movie so far this year ends up with someone crying 
 Or even someone dying 
 Do I listen to my head, do I listen to my heart? 
 Do I try to feel the same as I feel when we're apart? 
 Do I think about the end when it's only just the start? 
 Is there nothing we can do about it? 
 Anyone 
 Anyone can be so hard-hearted 
 But everyone 
 Still everybody wants a happy endingTake your mind back, I don't know when 
 Some time when it always seemed to be just us and them 
 Girls that wore pink and boys that wore blue 
 Boys that always grew up better men than me and you 
 What's a man now, what's a man mean 
 Is he rough or is he rugged 
 Is he cultural and clean 
 Now it's all changed, it's got to change more 
 'Cause we think it's getting better 
 But nobody's really sure 
 And so it goes, go 'round again 
 But now and then we wonder who the real men are 
 Whoa, hoh... 
 See the nice boys, dancing in pairs 
 Golden earring, golden tan, blow wave in their hair 
 Sure, they're all straight, straight as a line 
 All the gays are macho 
 Can't you see the leather shine 
 You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend 
 So don't call me a faggot 
 Not unless you are a friend 
 Then if you're tall and handsome and strong 
 You can wear the uniform and I could play along 
 And so it goes, go 'round again 
 But now and then we wonder who the real men are 
 Whoa, hoh... 
 Time to get scared, time to change plan 
 Don't know how to treat a lady 
 Don't know how to be a man 
 Time to admit what you call defeat 
 'Cause there's women running past you now 
 And you just drag your feet 
 Man makes a gun, man goes to war 
 Man can kill and man can drink 
 And man can take a whore 
 Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds 
 And if there's war between the sexes 
 Then there'll be no people left 
 And so it goes, go 'round again 
 But now and then we wonder who the real men are 
 Whoa, hoh...Moving my car forward a foot at a time 
 Another red light, another warning sign 
 Is that rain on the windshield 
 Wonder if it's raining on the Jersey side 
 Tapping my fingers to the radio 
 But I don't hear a thing 
 Watching the hookers move in and out of the light 
 One of these days, one of these days 
 One of these days 
 I'm gonna smash somebody's car 
 And smash the copper's face 
 As they take me away 
 But I gotta go home now 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 I gotta go home now 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 (My house, my house) 
 Only forty minutes to the Jersey side 
 Me and Suzy used to read the news and stay up all night 
 We used to see a lot of people, then we just got tired 
 And gave birth to a perfect little alibi 
 I take a sip of diet soda and loosen my tie 
 Another red light, another warning sign 
 Hey, that Puerto Rican hooker must be six feet tall 
 One of these days, one of these days 
 One of these days 
 I'm gonna turn the car around 
 And keep on going 
 Till I lose track of time 
 But I gotta go home now 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 I gotta go home now 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 (My house, my house) 
 Thirty-five minutes to the Jersey side 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 Another red light, another warning sign 
 (Don't wanna go to my house) 
 (My house, my house) 
 One of these days, one of these daysStrange 
 How the world got so small 
 I turned around and there was nowhere left to go 
 So sad 
 The dream always dies 
 Each new arrival closes places in my mind 
 But I can dream 
 Until I go 
 Of smells that I don't recognize 
 And by the river 
 In Shanghai 
 The colour of the sky 
 Is something I've never seen 
 After the summer rain 
 Children smile 
 Curious and kind 
 And the world is big againEvery time I turn the TV on it's always just the same old tease 
 See everything you ever dreamed that you could want 
 But nothing that you need 
 And every gorgeous girl in Hollywood could soon be mine 
 I got the money and from time to time I have the time 
 Get the image right 
 Party through the night 
 But as it's getting light 
 I'm still waiting for a soul kiss 
 Do I have to say please 
 But it's always just a near miss 
 It's just a big tease 
 Is it always gonna be like this 
 When you're lookin' for a soul kiss 
 And all the record stores 
 Are filled with pretty boys and their material girls 
 And even students vote for actors 
 Then they tell you it's a safer world 
 And all the hippies work for IBM and wanna take control 
 Of faster ways to sell you food that isn't really whole 
 I like to wine and dine 
 You sure are lookin' fine 
 And we could kill some time 
 But I'm waiting for a soul kiss 
 I've even said please 
 But it's always just a near miss 
 It's just a big tease 
 Is it always gonna be like this 
 When you're lookin' for a soul kiss 
 I'm still waiting for a soul kiss 
 Do I have to say please 
 And it's always just a near miss 
 It's just a big tease 
 Is it always gonna be like this 
 When you're lookin' for a soul kissI'm gonna ring your bell 
 Because I got your number 
 I'm gonna knock as well 
 We got a rhythm delivery 
 I'm gonna stomp and yell 
 We gonna bring a drummer 
 We gotta beat that swell 
 We got a rhythm delivery 
 Babe, I'm gonna cheer you up 
 Set your table, fill your cup 
 Don't you think I should come up 
 Check that I got what you wanted 
 So get it while it's hot 
 And get it while it's jumpin' 
 'Cause if you're in or not 
 We got a rhythm delivery 
 Yes, I'm gonna rock your soul 
 You will go to high from low 
 You from swell will go to hip 
 But honey, don't forget my tip 
 So get it while it's hot 
 And get it while it's jumpin' 
 'Cause if you're in or not 
 I got a rhythm deliveryTwo in the morning, there's a drink in my hand 
 Nothing moving in this place but sweat 
 I heard a rumour 'bout a Cajun band 
 The bartender says it's early yet 
 Wait, the bartender says it's early yet 
 Too many olives in too much gin 
 Steppin' out in the City of Sin 
 Too much dirty rice and too many beans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New Orleans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New Orleans 
 Have another, I believe I will 
 And you can stir it with a dirty spoon 
 There's a prescription that I've got to fill 
 And the doctor's gonna be here soon 
 Jimmy says the doctor's gonna be here soon 
 Too many olives in too much gin 
 Steppin' out in the City of Sin 
 Too much dirty rice and too many beans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New Orleans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New Orleans 
 Too many olives in too much gin 
 Steppin' out in the City of Sin 
 Too much dirty rice and too many beans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New Orleans 
 Gettin' down and dirty down in New OrleansIf I could be two places at one time 
 I'd be with you 
 Me and you against the world 
 I've lost my heart, I'm losing half my mind 
 But I don't care 
 Me and you against the world 
 Don't tell me, don't ask me, don't talk at all 
 Don't help me, I don't know if I can stand 
 The bittersweetness of it all 
 I don't know, I don't care, don't even hear 
 What they all say 
 Me and you against the world 
 There's no past, there's no future, and no fear 
 What can they do? 
 Me and you against the world 
 I'm helpless, I can't talk, or even stand 
 My heart won't start until I get from you 
 The look that says you love me, too 
 Me and you against the world 
 Me and you against the world 
 Me and you against the world 
 I've read the Bible and those books at school 
 But they don't make much sense of this 
 The finest minds are calling me a fool 
 But you destroy them with your kiss 
 Just one kiss 
 Don't tell me, don't ask me, don't talk at all 
 Don't help me, I don't know if I can stand 
 The bittersweetness of it all 
 Me and you against the world 
 Me and you against the world 
 Me and you against the worldYou stole a wig from your sister 
 And a gun from your dad 
 I guess I knew when I kissed ya 
 You're a little bit mad 
 You don't care if you get sick 
 Living on bubble gum 
 Maybe too much lipstick 
 Made your mouth go dumb 
 I have to say that we were suited 
 But you know what they say about Cupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 So we got ourselves messed up 
 And we did it with style 
 And the way we were dressed up 
 Was a little bit wild 
 Stack heels and tiaras 
 We were oh so redefined 
 Or maybe too much mascara 
 Made my eyes go blind 
 I don't know if we were deluded 
 But I know what they say about Cupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 I guess to do what me and you did 
 You have to be just a bit like Cupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Just a little bit 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupid 
 Little bit stupidOf all the streets in the world 
 You walk down this one 
 And I see three hundred girls 
 But just want to kiss one 
 Someone that we've loved before 
 Is a love forever 
 But I never thought you'd floor me again 
 Maybe I should 
 Rush across the road 
 Leave my heavy load behind 
 It just takes a second to know your mind 
 And do what you've got to do 
 I'll rush across the road to catch up with you 
 Catch up with you 
 Some things come to an end 
 Before they're done with 
 Were we too young to be friends 
 That you just have fun with 
 What were all our fights and fears 
 'Cause I can't remember 
 And I've had enough of tears anyway 
 So I think I'll 
 Rush across the road 
 Leave my heavy load behind 
 It just takes a second to know your mind 
 And do what you've got to do 
 I'll rush across the road to catch up with you 
 Catch up with you 
 Time after time I'm reminded 
 That it's a crime to say I've lost 
 When I decline just to find out the final score 
 Why can't I pass the line and defy 
 The sign that says "Don't Cross" 
 Or what am I living for 
 Funny how the blink of an eye 
 Can last forever 
 And how we think ourselves dry 
 When it's now or never 
 If I wait for one more sigh 
 You could turn and see me 
 Then I'll never know what I would have done 
 So I'm going to 
 Rush across the road 
 Leave my heavy load behind 
 It just takes a second to know your mind 
 And do what you've got to do 
 I'll rush across the road to catch up with you 
 Catch up with youIn the supermarket 
 There is music while you work 
 It drives you crazy, sends you screaming for the door 
 Work there for a year or two 
 And you can't get to like it 
 I don't work in supermarkets anymore 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Grab can, lift arm, stack can, turn around 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Do the instant mash, do the instant mash 
 Do the instant mash, make an instant smash 
 Doin' the instant mash 
 In the Discorama 
 There's a DJ tries to charm ya 
 They got flashin' lights to dance to if you're shy 
 Red for treble, green for bass 
 They're wired in sequence 'round the place 
 You wait till ten, then try to take off your tie 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Lift hand, flick wrist, drop hand, turn around 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Do the instant mash, do the instant mash 
 Do the instant mash, make some instant cash 
 Doin' the instant mash 
 In the cinema tonight 
 They sit and watch the robots fight 
 The human beings don't have much to say 
 Robots making lots of cash 
 And all they eat is instant mash 
 Oh wouldn't you just love to be that way? 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Heat it, beat it, eat it, turn around 
 It's so easy, it's so easy 
 Do the instant mash, do the instant mash 
 Do the instant mash, make an instant smash 
 Doin' the instant mashMother doesn't go out anymore 
 Just sits at home and rolls her spastic eyes 
 But every weekend through the door 
 Come words of wisdom from the world outside 
 If you want to know about the bishop and the actress 
 If you want to know how to be a star 
 If you want to know about the stains on the mattress 
 You can read it in the Sunday papers, Sunday papers 
 Mother's wheelchair stays out in the hall 
 Why should she go out when the TV's on 
 Whatever moves beyond these walls 
 She'll know the facts when Sunday comes along 
 If you want to know about the mad punk rockers 
 If you want to know how to play guitar 
 If you want to know about any other suckers 
 You can read it in the Sunday papers

 Well I got nothing against the press

 If you want to know how to drive your car 
 If you want to know about the new sex position

 Loved a no-good gamblin' man 
 She drank the coffee dregs 
 So she could fry his eggs 
 In a golden frying pan 
 Can-canned by command 
 Of the Gold Rush Cafe clan 
 She gave her man her pay 
 He gambled it away 
 Playing Chinatown fan-tan 
 Once they caught him cheatin' 
 And he knew that he was beaten 
 When a miner aimed a pistol at his head 
 Fanny, when she'd seen him 
 Ran and jumped right in between 'em 
 And she stopped a dozen slugs of poison lead 
 There was Fanny dyin' 
 While a hundred men stood cryin' 
 And the angels up above were cryin' too 
 When seven horses started draggin' 
 Fanny's coffin in a wagon 
 Through a dusty Californian avenue 
 San Francisco Fan 
 Gave her life to save her man 
 A man who wasn't worth 
 A shovelful of earth 
 From the grave of San Francisco Fan 
 San Francisco Fan

 From the grave of San Francisco FanHere we go, Monday morning at last 
 In the land of the brave and the bold 
 Sunlight is hurting my eyes 
 But it's on to the glittering prize 
 There's a rent to pay 
 Give me a coffee to go, make it fast 
 There'll be a merger before it gets cold 
 They've closed down the whole seventh floor 
 The young guns are ready for war 
 But I'm holding on 
 Long ago and far away 
 I was safe and sound 
 But love got lost 
 Along the way 
 Saturday night, went to see La Bohème 
 Used the spare ticket just for my coat 
 I guess I should swallow my pride 
 But I'd be damned if I hawked it outside 
 In the pouring rain 
 Monday morning and no one to blame 
 Keep hitting icebergs but I'm still afloat 
 I'd like a new body and face 
 But I'd settle for a friend with a space 
 On their calendar 
 Up to now and hard to say 
 Wonder what I've found 
 But love got lost 
 Along the way 
 Here comes Mr. Worldly and Wise 
 If he touches me again I'll scream 
 I can't stand his sensitive eyes 
 Like I'm some dying diva to him 
 Touch me 
 Don't touch me 
 Touch me 
 Don't touch me 
 Don't touch me 
 Don't touch me 
 Long ago and far away 
 I was safe and sound 
 But love got lost 
 Along the wayWe hear you, we see it 
 You do it like you wanna be it 
 And we're the guys to guarantee it 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 We got it, we're on it 
 And we can write you like a sonnet 
 But you can't fight us if you want it 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 You're our kind of rebel 
 It's your kind of time 
 'Cause everyone gets one chance 
 So scowl for the camera 
 But don't howl at the moon 
 Be a good bad boy 
 We move it, we shake it 
 And we're not asking you to fake it 
 But we know just how far to take it 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Come on now, the first thing 
 We got to get your body working 
 You're gonna sweat until you're hurting 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 We'll take off some clothes then 
 We'll take off some pounds 
 And then we can start to dance 
 So snarl for the camera 
 But don't large it too soon 
 Be a good bad boy 
 So pout for the camera 
 But don't shout out the tune 
 Be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boy 
 Get in the line and be a good bad boyDid you do me right? 
 Did I do right by you? 
 When I bare my soul it seems you do not hear 
 Can this be true? 
 Am I a fool to fight? 
 I could do just what you say 
 But I'm following my heart and that takes me another way 
 It's not easy when there's no one giving prizes at the end 
 Waiting in the wings 
 Wishing that the band would start to play 
 As the show begins 
 Wonder what the critics have to say 
 Waiting 
 Waiting 
 For the verdict 
 Some people live so fast 
 They're so scared of getting old 
 Some people keep on working 
 All they do is line their graves with gold 
 We don't know what happens when we die 
 We only know we die too soon 
 But we have to try or else our world becomes a waiting room 
 Would you testify for me? 
 I think I'd do the same for you 
 Waiting in the dark 
 Waiting for the phone to ring all day 
 My witness disappears 
 Wonder what the jury has to say 
 Waiting 
 Waiting 
 For the verdict 
 Waiting 
 Waiting 
 Waiting 
 WaitingOf all the stupid things I could have thought 
 This was the worst 
 I started to believe 
 That I was born at seventeen 
 And all the stupid things 
 The letters and the broken verse 
 Stayed hidden at the bottom of the drawer 
 They'd always been 
 And now I plough through piles 
 Of bills, receipts, and credit cards 
 And tickets and the Daily News 
 And sometimes I just 
 Wanna go back to my home town 
 Though I know it'll never be the same 
 Back to my home town 
 'Cause it's been so long 
 And I'm wondering if it's still there 
 We think we're pretty smart 
 Us city slickers get around 
 And when the going's rough 
 We kill the pain and relocate 
 We're never married 
 Never faithful, not to any town 
 But we never leave the past behind 
 We just accumulate 
 So sometimes when the music stops 
 I seem to hear a distant sound 
 Of waves and seagulls 
 Football crowds and church bells 
 And I 
 Wanna go back to my home town 
 Though I know it'll never be the same 
 Back to my home town 
 'Cause it's been so long 
 And I'm wondering if it's still there 
 Back to my home town 
 Though I know it'll never be the same 
 Back to my home town 
 'Cause it's been so long 
 And I'm wondering if it's still thereI gotta tell you a story from way back

 Five guys named Moe 
 When they start to beat it out 
 Everybody jump and shout 
 Tell me who do the critics rave about 
 Five guys named Moe 
 They came out of nowhere 
 But that don't mean a thing 
 They rate high and you'll know why

 They're the best in harmony

 Why should everything be such a fuss 
 It's so difficult to pretend 
 That the living is easy with us 
 You tell me what to do 
 And I tell you where to go 
 One and one is two 
 But not because you tell me so 
 If it wasn't for you 
 I bet I could do better sleeping at night 
 It's so difficult to forget 
 Every stupid or meaningless fight 
 You say go away 
 And I say it's fine with me 
 Then I want to stay 
 Nowhere that I'd rather be 
 You can be anything 
 A slave or a master 
 Any joker or any king can be a 
 Sad bastard 
 And I'd be one too 
 If it wasn't for you 
 If it wasn't for me, I guess 
 You could be someone better by now 
 It's so difficult to confess 
 But I see we're together somehow 
 I don't want to know 
 If I got it right or wrong 
 Hope you never go 
 Hope we're gonna get along 
 You can be anyone 
 A beggar or chooser 
 Any father or any son can be a 
 Real loser 
 And I'd be one too 
 If it wasn't for you 
 You can be anything 
 A slave or a master 
 Any joker or any king can be a 
 Sad bastard 
 And I'd be one too 
 If it wasn't for you 
 And I'd be one too 
 If it wasn't for you 
 And I'd be one too

 From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold 
 Look over there (where?) 
 There, there's a lady that I used to know 
 She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 Is she really gonna take him home tonight? 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me 
 There's something going wrong around here 
 Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street 
 I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth 
 Look over there (where?) 
 There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend 
 They say that looks don't count for much 
 If so there goes your proof 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 Is she really gonna take him home tonight? 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me 
 There's something going wrong around here 
 Around here 
 But if looks could kill 
 There's a man there who is marked down as dead 
 'Cause I've had my fill 
 Listen, you, take your hands from her head 
 I get so mean around the scene 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 Is she really gonna take him home tonight? 
 Is she really going out with him? 
 'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me 
 There's something going wrong around here 
 Around here 
 Something going wrong around here 
 Something going wrong around here 
 Something going wrong around here 
 Something going wrong aroundThese words of love so hard for me to find 
 How can I change my mind if you can only lie? 
 These shattered dreams I try to build again 
 But looks could kill again and I'm too young to die 
 Smiling faces all around us 
 You don't wanna make a scene 
 Not here, not now 
 And I don't wanna cry 
 We drink the wine like we were really friends 
 But can our sadness end and work turn into play? 
 We dress so fine and step out on the town 
 And friends may gather round but soon will turn away 
 Smiling faces all around us 
 You don't wanna make a scene 
 Not here, not now 
 And I don't wanna cry 
 Smiling faces all around us 
 You don't wanna make a scene 
 Not here, not now 
 And I don't wanna cryOK let me tell you 'bout 
 Some of the things I'm going through 
 I know you think that you know 
 But how do you know 
 That what you know is true 
 Well maybe it's time for getting out of line 
 It seems like the done thing to do 
 Some people get crazy 
 Some people get lazy 
 Some people get hazy 
 Some people get out 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Now the cocaine club says welcome 
 You're in college now, not school 
 But I'm sorry to say that I'm going out to work 
 While you're going to the swimming pool 
 Where the L.A. sun can turn your brains 
 To scrambled eggs, it's true 
 Some people get crazy 
 Some people get lazy 
 Some people get hazy 
 Some people get out 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Some people think that they know about some girls 
 Some people think they're cool 
 And some girls think that they know about me 
 Some girls think I'm some fool 
 And American girls that put their tongue in your ear 
 When they talk on the telephone 
 And the stars only come out at night 
 When the press and photographers moan and groan 
 And the Playboy centerfold leaves me cold 
 And that ain't 'cause I'm a fag 
 So you playboys can just go play with yourself 
 That's your style 
 'Cause that's a drag 
 You get crazy 
 Get crazy 
 I just wanna get 
 Just wanna get out 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Take me away, I said, take me away 
 I don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like that 
 Don't wanna be like thatThere was a man in the jungle 
 Trying to make ends meet 
 Found himself one day with an axe in his hand 
 When a voice said "Buddy, can you spare that tree 
 We gotta save this world starting with your land." 
 It was a rock 'n' roll millionaire from the USA 
 Doing three to the gallon in a big white car 
 And he sang and he sang till he polluted the air 
 And he blew a lot of smoke from a Cuban cigar 
 And the stars are looking down 
 Through a hole in the sky 
 And if they could see they'd cry 
 That's obvious 
 And the walls are coming down 
 Between the west and the east 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in peace 
 That's obvious 
 It's obvious, obvious 
 There was a kid in the city selling crack to get by 
 Got caught one day with a gun in his hand 
 When a voice said, "Okay, get 'em up in the air 
 You're too young to live like this 
 But you ain't too fast to die." 
 Just another foot soldier in a stupid little war 
 Another sound bite on the American scene 
 Caught between the supplier only dreaming of money 
 And the demand of the man with money 
 Who needs a little help to dream 
 So we starve all the teachers 
 And recruit more Marines 
 How come we don't even know what that means 
 It's obvious 
 And the walls are coming down 
 Between the eagle and the dove 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in love 
 That's obvious 
 It's obvious, obvious 
 And the walls are coming down 
 Between the west and the east 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in peace 
 The walls are coming down 
 Beween the eagle and the dove 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in love 
 It's obvious 
 It's obvious 
 'Cause the walls are coming down 
 Between the eagle and the dove 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in love 
 The walls are coming down 
 Between the west and the east 
 You don't have to be a hippie to believe in peace 
 It's obvious 
 It's obviousThere's a country where no one knows 
 What's going on in the rest of the world 
 There's a country where minds are closed 
 With just a few asking questions 
 Like what do their leaders say 
 In sessions behind closed doors 
 And if this is the perfect way 
 Why do we need these goddamn lies 
 This doesn't go down too well 
 "We give you everything, you throw it back 
 Don't like it here, you can go to hell 
 You're either with or against us" 
 There's a country that's great and wide 
 It's got the biggest of everything 
 Try to attack it and you can't hide 
 Don't say that you haven't been warned 
 You can't hide in a gunman's mask 
 Or kill innocent folks and run 
 But if you're good at it they might ask 
 Come on over to the other side 
 There's a country that's tired of war 
 There's a country that's scared inside 
 But the bank is open and you can draw 
 For guns that fight in their backyard 
 I could go on but what's the use 
 You can't fight them with songs 
 But think of this as just another tiny blow against the Empire 
 Another blow against the Evil Empire 
 Another blow against the Evil Empire 
 Just another blow against the Evil Empire 
 Just another blow against the Evil EmpireWhen you got no more assurance 
 Than a great big hunk o' lead 
 If you don't respond to romance 
 Jack, you dead 
 When a chick is smilin' at you 
 Even though there's nothin' said 
 You stand there like a statue 
 Jack, you dead 
 You been always kickin' 
 But you stubbed your toes 
 When you ups and kicks the bucket 
 Just like ole man Mose' 
 When you get no kicks from lovin' 
 And you blow your top instead 
 It's a fact that you ain't livin' 
 Jack, you dead 
 When you just ain't got nobody 
 Since you gone and lost your head 
 Rigor mortis has set in, daddy 
 Jack, you dead 
 What's the use of havin' muscles 
 If your life hangs by a thread 
 If you ain't got no red corpuscles 
 Jack, you dead 
 You been always kickin' 
 But you stubbed your toes 
 When you ups and kicks the bucket 
 Just like ole man Mose' 
 When you get no kicks from lovin' 
 And the news begins to spread 
 All the cats will holler "murder" 
 Jack, you dead 
 All the breath has leaked out of you 
 If your friends gather 'round the bed 
 And look at you and say "Mm mm, don't he look natural?" 
 When that happens to you, daddy 
 Jack, you deadI guess we can still be friends 
 I guess we can talk at least 
 But if we were seventeen 
 Imagine the things we'd do 
 I know that those days are over 
 I'm glad that those games are won 
 And the winners ride off into the sunset 
 But it's not the same for you 
 And I don't want to play those 
 Nasty games that adults play 
 But I can't let you go 
 And I can't see another way 
 And I know that she's the only one for me 
 And you know that if I could split in two 
 The other me 
 Would stay all night 
 The other me 
 Would hold you tight 
 The other me 
 Would be the only one for you 
 When I see you there alone 
 It almost breaks my heart 
 But it doesn't break enough 
 For me to break my whole life apart 
 I guess we could still be friends 
 And we can talk all night 
 But I have to bite my tongue 
 And sometimes words don't come out right 
 We're old enough to know what 
 We can think or say out loud 
 To know that hearts are not just 
 Cards to play when two's a crowd 
 And I know that she's the only one for me 
 And you know that if I could split in two 
 The other me 
 Would stay all night 
 The other me 
 Would hold you tight 
 The other me 
 Would be the only one for you 
 The other me 
 Would take you so far away from here 
 And he'd be 
 A man with a mission 
 The other me 
 Might even be better than this one 
 I know that she's the only one for me 
 And you know that if I could split in two 
 The other me 
 Would stay all night 
 The other me 
 Would hold you tight 
 The other me 
 Would be the only one for youI got drunk with a real nice guy last night 
 In a mood to talk or fight 
 And he said what's the matter 
 You don't look like you do so bad 
 I said I just been taken for everything I had 
 Someone took a fancy to my wallet and my coat 
 So what you smiling at 
 Ain't you been in that boat 
 It's something that there really should be 
 Something done about 
 He said, don't knock it, sonny 
 That's the way I started out 
 And now I got a nice suit 
 I got a nice car 
 It's been a nice day 
 Don't tell me that crime don't pay 
 OKI could cool out 
 I could hang loose 
 I could lay my head back in this comfortable noose 
 I could watch the paint dry 
 On these rented walls 
 Or I could run wild with the first wild thing that calls 
 Goin' downtown, goin' downtown 
 Goin' downtown 
 To stand 'round and stare 
 And put people down for not being there 
 Goin' downtown 
 And I'll see you there 
 But I saw you laugh 
 At that girl having fun 
 To show some emotion just isn't done 
 You can look but don't touch 
 That's as far as it goes 
 You're only as good as the cut of your clothes 
 Goin' downtown, goin' downtown 
 Goin' downtown 
 To stand 'round and stare 
 And put people down for not being there 
 Goin' downtown 
 And I'll see you there 
 Goin' downtown, goin' downtown 
 Goin' downtown 
 To stand 'round and stare 
 And put people down for not being there 
 Goin' downtown 
 And I'll see you there 
 There’s gotta be more to life than this 
 Goin' downtown, goin' downtown 
 Goin’ downtown, goin’ downtown 
 Downtown 
 Goin’ downtownI should have known you were only just fifteen 
 You had a scowl like a Klingon beauty queen 
 Old enough to stand out but too young to stand with pride 
 So uncomfortable in your messed-up skin 
 And the cool parties never let you in 
 I can still relate to being left so high and dry 
 Don't cry 
 You're just at an awkward age 
 We'll all be fine 
 Disgraceful under pressure 
 Don't tow the line 
 You're just at an awkward age 
 Don't cry 
 Don't cry 
 You're just at an awkward 
 You look at me like I know what's going on 
 I'm looking back and I wonder what went wrong 
 I really thought by now a few things might just clarify 
 I got a mind that goes out to lunch for days 
 And a body that sometimes disobeys 
 I get into the parties but I hate them 'cause I'm shy 
 Oh my 
 I'm still at an awkward age 
 We'll all be fine 
 Disgraceful under pressure 
 Don't tow the line 
 You're just at an awkward age 
 Don't cry 
 Don't cry 
 You're just at an awkward 
 We're supposed to be happy 
 Supposed to be tough 
 Supposed to be flawless 
 And buy the right stuff 
 They want us all swimming 
 Don't care if we drown 
 So don't let them take you down 
 It's a scary mountain to climb up without a guide 
 Besides 
 We live in an awkward age 
 We'll all be fine 
 Disgraceful under pressure 
 Don't tow the line 
 You're just at an awkward age 
 Don't cry 
 Don't cry 
 You're just at an awkward 
 AgeBig shot, tell you what 
 Tell me what goes on around here 
 Go on and get me in the corner 
 Smoke my cigarettes and drink my beer 
 Tell me that this world is no place for the weak 
 Then you can look me in the eye 
 And tell me if you see a trace of fear 
 You gotta look sharp 
 You gotta look sharp 
 And you gotta have no illusions 
 Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder 
 OK, what you say 
 Tell me what they're wearing this year 
 Go on and laugh at me 'cause you don't see 
 That I got something going right here 
 Say I'm just a dreamer, say I'm just a kid 
 Well, ace, shut your face 
 Maybe you will see or hear 
 You gotta look sharp 
 You gotta look sharp 
 And you gotta have no illusions 
 Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder 
 Big shot, thanks a lot 
 Gotta go, it's getting late 
 I got a date with my tailor now 
 Thanks for putting me so straight 
 Tell me how they robbed me blind on every street 
 But check your watch and wallet now 
 Before I go and you're too late 
 You gotta look sharp 
 You gotta look sharp 
 And you gotta have no illusions 
 Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder 
 YeahGod must think he's God or something 
 Lording it over us 
 Seems to like to make us feel 
 Ridiculous 
 Gives us just one life then lets us 
 Think it's not enough 
 Where can you get a better deal 
 But we can dream 
 Or we can work and scheme and 
 Make it go much too long 
 And I could scream 
 But it don't work and dreams are 
 Maybe where God cam from 
 So I'll 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Even if I never get it right 
 God just made himself the master 
 Of the universe 
 Made us into black and white and his and hers 
 Gave us just two eyes but what we 
 See is just a blur 
 But we get to sleep at night 
 And we get to dream 
 Or we can work and scheme and 
 Make it go much too long 
 And I could scream 
 But it don't work and dreams are 
 Maybe where I belong 
 So I'll 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Even if I never get it right 
 And I could scream 
 Keep on singing till I get it right 
 Keep on swinging till I get it right 
 Keep on thinking till I get it right 
 Keep on drinking till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Keep on dreaming till I get it right 
 Even if I never get it rightAh, look at all the lonely people 
 Ah, look at all the lonely people 
 Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been 
 Lives in a dream 
 Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door 
 Who is it for? 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all come from? 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all belong? 
 Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear 
 No one comes near. 
 Look at him working. 
 Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there 
 What does he care? 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all come from? 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all belong? 
 Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name 
 Nobody came 
 Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave 
 No one was saved 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all come from? 
 All the lonely people 
 Where do they all belong?Sometimes I feel so alive 
 Sometimes I see so clear 
 Just like the way we always were 
 So young and free from fear 
 I lose my fear of war and dying 
 And all the clouds just disappear 
 Only my mirror sees me crying 
 Each time I lose another year 
 Wouldn't it be a drag to be like you 
 Settling down and having kids 
 And telling them what to do 
 Well I'm gonna stay 
 Nineteen forever, yes I am 
 Nineteen forever, I'm gonna be 
 Nineteen forever, yes I will 
 Nineteen forever 
 We can do magic in these times 
 Be what we want to be 
 We'll all be rock 'n' roll stars 
 Immortal on TV 
 And if you see me looking tired 
 I've just been sleeping through the day 
 But I got something to keep me wired 
 So we can dance the night away 
 Wouldn't it be a drag to be like them 
 They're gonna sell out everything 
 But I won't get fooled again 
 'Cause I'm gonna be 
 Nineteen forever, yes I will 
 Nineteen forever, no matter what you say 
 Nineteen forever, I'm gonna be 
 Nineteen forever 
 You better believe it 
 You know my dream's still alive 
 You can love it or leave it 
 But I'm never gonna be thirty-five 
 Nineteen forever, yes I am 
 Nineteen forever, well I'm gonna be 
 Nineteen forever, no matter what you say 
 Nineteen forever 
 Nineteen forever, well I'm gonna stay 
 Nineteen forever, this is my life 
 Nineteen forever 
 Nineteen forever, yes I am 
 Nineteen forever 
 Nineteen forever 
 You better believe it 
 You better believe it 
 Come on, one more timeHere 
 See the little queer 
 There's a volunteer 
 Don't you think that he should get a haircut 
 Now 
 Like in the Marines 
 All the magazines 
 Got a way for everyone to shape up 
 You don't wanna fall behind 
 Choking on a cloud of fairy dust, fairy dust 
 Now it's only greed and lust 
 And pride and lust 
 And a few other sins 
 No 
 See the cherry lips 
 Hands on the hips 
 Anyone would think your name was Oscar Wilde 
 Think you're pretty smart 
 Poetry and art 
 Put him on testosterone and vodka 
 Calling for the man of steel 
 To blow you faggots into fairy dust, fairy dust 
 Now it's only greed and lust 
 And pride and lust 
 And a few other sins 
 We're 
 Happy to be gay 
 Showing you the way 
 Gotta get your head, your heart, your torso 
 Hard 
 Join another gym 
 Lose your pseudonym 
 Soon we'll all be straight but only more so 
 Tell me who you're gonna find 
 To sprinkle on a little fairy dust, fairy dust 
 Now it's only greed and lust 
 And pride and lust 
 And a few other sinsWho dat say who dat when I say who dat 
 You cats keep beatin' up your chops 
 I oughta turn you over to the cops 
 But dig this spiel, I'm gonna lay on your gate 
 Don't cop your broom, park the body and the bait 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother

 You talk so much you got me disgusted 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 Yeah, you run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother

 End up telling me how to handle my gal 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You always telling me what to do 
 Saying "I wouldn't do that if I was you" 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You clamp your liver lips and I'll run my business, brother 
 Just clamp your liver lips and I'll run my business, brother 
 If I follows your advice on how to make dough 
 I'd been in the jailhouse long ago 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 Yeah, you run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 Just you run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 You tell everybody I'm busted 
 You talk so much you got me disgusted 
 You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother 
 Do you hear me, Jack?What I want, I want now 
 And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow" 
 I wanna fly, fly a fountain 
 I wanna jump, jump, jump, jump a mountain 
 I understand all 
 Destructive urges 
 It seems so perfect 
 I see, I see no 
 Evil 
 I get ideas, I get a notion 
 I want a nice little boat made out of ocean 
 I get your point, you're so sharp 
 Getting good reactions with your be-bo talk 
 I understand all 
 Destructive urges 
 It seems so perfect 
 I see, I see no 
 Evil 
 Don't say unconscious, no, don't say doom 
 Well, if you got to say it, well let me leave this room 
 'Cause what I want, I want now 
 And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow" 
 I understand all 
 Destructive urges 
 It seems so perfect 
 I see, I see no 
 Evil 
 I'm runnin' wild with the one I love 
 I'm runnin' crazy with the one I love 
 I'm runnin' wild with the one-eyed ones 
 Pull down the future with the one I love 
 Pull down the future with the one you love 
 Pull down the future with the one I love 
 Pull down the future with the one you love

 Pull down the future with the one I love 
 Pull down the future with the one I love

 I don't know why 
 People say there's no such thing as love 
 I got a job in S.E. 15 
 And after tax my wage is 16 
 July the 17th I'll be 18 
 I don't think I'll live till 19 
 People say I'm looking so much older than what I am 
 People laugh at me when I say why 
 I'm being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 I'm being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 Working for a man who wears a straw hat and never smiles 
 And an apron striped and splashed with blood 
 I stack a pig's head on the shelf 
 The boss comes along and says move yourself 
 I can't move I'm hypnotized 
 Staring into a dead pig's eyes 
 I turn around and all I see is ladies 
 With shopping bags 
 Staring at me trying to read my mind 
 And I'm being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 I'm being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 Walking home on my own 
 Standing on the bus stop, crossing the road 
 I'm being followed 'cause I can feel 
 Someone's breath on my neck 
 Someone's toe on my heel 
 Gotta keep on walking 
 I can't stop now, I've come too far 
 Wait till I get home and lock the door 
 I got the candles burning low 
 I got The Cramps on the stereo 
 I got the doll, now I can start 
 With a pin right trough the heart 
 I got dolls with straw hats 
 I got ladies with shopping bags 
 They'll be sorry they crossed me tonight 
 Now they're being watched 
 They're being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 Being watched 
 By the evil eye 
 Being watched 
 By the evil eyeWon't you be my number two? 
 Me and number one are through 
 There won't be too much to do 
 Just smile when I feel blue 
 And there's not much left of me 
 What you get is what you see 
 Is it worth the energy? 
 I'll leave it up to you 
 And if you got something to say to me 
 Don't try to lay your funny ways on me 
 I know that it's really not fair of me 
 But my heart's seen too much action 
 And every time I look at you 
 You'll be who I want you to 
 And I'll do what I can do 
 To make a dream or two come true 
 (If you'll be my) 
 If you'll be my number two 
 And if you got something to say to me 
 Don't try to lay your funny ways on me 
 I know that it's really not fair of me 
 But my heart's seen too much action 
 And every time I look at you 
 You'll be who I want you to 
 And I'll do what I can do 
 To make a dream or two come true 
 (If you'll be my) 
 If you'll be my number twoEverything

 Everything gives you cancer 
 Don't touch that dial 
 Don't try to smile 
 Just take this pill 
 It's in your file 
 Don't work hard 
 Don't play hard 
 Don't plan for the graveyard

 But that's alll right 
 You made me laugh, then made me cry, then made me shout 
 But that's all right 
 But something keeps on beating in there 
 I guess my heart survived 
 I know I said I couldn't live without you 
 But I'm still alive 
 Still alive 
 Still alive 
 You took me out there on a trip that tripped me out 
 But that's all right 
 I'm still confused about what it was all about 
 But that's all right 
 They say it's better to be travelling than to arrive 
 But then they said I couldn't live without you 
 And I'm still alive 
 Still alive 
 Still alive 
 In the beginning we were there till the end of time 
 It isn't sinning to prepare for the kind of murder 
 That's not a crime 
 I guess I knew you guessed I knew when we were through 
 But that's all right 
 I'd tell you what to do if I could tell what's true 
 But that's all right 
 I think I'd better think it over 
 For a year or five 
 But then I thought I couldn't live without you 
 And I'm still alive 
 Still alive 
 Still alive 
 Still alive 
 Still aliveOf all the treasure in our chest 
 We love the golden god of war the best 
 Look, look at that little clown 
 Here, look through the binoculars 
 Someone burned his schoolhouse down 
 And he's blinking in the sun 
 And he's drying something in the sun 
 Ha, it's an old teabag 
 Now he rolls it up 
 Look, he made a cigarette 
 But he's not gonna smoke it yet 
 Maybe he's gonna sell it 
 How much do you think he'll get? 
 A slice of ham - a long goodbye - three days of peace 
 A bar of soap - a can of oil - ten years of debt 
 A pinch of salt - a week of news - four double A's 
 A plastic bag - a place to hide - one sucker bet 
 I got what you want 
 You got what I need 
 Of all the sterling men of steel 
 We crave the one who'll teach us not to feel 
 Look at the guy selling beer 
 Where the hell does he get it from? 
 He's the king of the hill 
 He's the bug that survives the bomb 
 See the smirk on his greasy face 
 Handing a bottle to the mortal foe 
 It's not the time to kill 
 Not that he forgets 
 As he takes a crumpled bill 
 And thinks, this is better yet 
 A pot for the rain - a pair of shoes - two hand grenades 
 A spade for a grave - four lovely eggs - three cigarettes 
 A stick of gum - some wood for a fire - two table legs 
 A cup of rice - a pint of blood - one pound of flesh 
 Line up to buy here 
 Line up to die there 
 Look, look through that window 
 Looks like your sister there 
 In a Chetnik's bed 
 Look, there on the table 
 Looks like she did it for a loaf of bread 
 Shit! She's got a knife! 
 And he's snoring like a pig 
 Is he worth more alive or dead? 
 How much for his boots? 
 How much for his head? 
 Through all the days and all the times 
 We count the coin and stash away the crimesShall I stay or go 
 Through the door 
 Will the pen to flow 
 Watch the stars 
 Sleep's a chore 
 The moon is growing cold 
 It hangs like a sliver of tin 
 How do our dreams unfold 
 And why are my bones feeling thin 
 I watch my pen as though 
 My fingers could shatter like icicles 
 And before my eyes 
 Lie glittering and useless on a field of snowIt's me and me alone 
 Against the night 
 So easy to be scared 
 Without the light 
 Things under my bed try to shake me 
 I listen to the trains 
 Trains to take me 
 Far away, far away 
 Far away from England 
 My dreams and me 
 It's me and me alone 
 Against the world 
 So far from all the cares 
 Of boys and girls 
 Monsters in the dark 
 Still whisper to me 
 I listen to the planes 
 Planes that flew me 
 Far away, far away 
 Far away from England 
 My dreams and meIf I stop 
 And think about it 
 I'm either stone cold certain 
 Or more inclined to doubt it 
 But when you jump into the darkness 
 Well I take off my hat 
 You've changed 
 They say you can know when to play or to hold 
 And they think they can show all that glitters is gold 
 And they don't care to go where you go 
 'Cause they know you're insane 
 When you change 
 To the uptown train 
 Well I knew 
 That you were trouble 
 You were a ten-time loser 
 Or maybe even double 
 But you pulled some kind of rabbit 
 From your hippie hat 
 You've changed 
 They say take it slow when you're breaking the mold 
 Got to pay what you owe or be out in the cold 
 And they don't care to know what you know 
 Or to go through the pain 
 To change 
 To the uptown trainI don't love you 
 But I'm lost 
 Thinking of you 
 And the ghosts of so many special moments 
 That passed so quickly at the time 
 And now they come and track me down 
 And echo 'round and 'round and 'round 
 And time goes slowly 
 Disappears completely 
 And I feel like I fade away 
 Like drowning 
 I don't need you 
 But it's so hard 
 To be without you 
 Though you're not far away 
 I censor my emotions 
 And tell myself to bide my time 
 But every time you won't come around 
 You batter my defenses down 
 But so gently 
 Like some sweet hypnosis 
 And the world just slips away 
 I'm drowning 
 It's dark 
 My heart is pounding 
 I'm sinking down 
 Into a pool of passion 
 There's laughter as I drown 
 Like so many lost before me 
 Damned by lust and gone to hell 
 And then I look into your eyes 
 And something melts 
 I shake inside 
 And cool water 
 Washes me all over 
 Washes me away 
 And still I'm drowningSometimes you start feeling so lost and lonely 
 Then you find it's all been in your mind 
 Sometimes you think someone is the one and only 
 Can't you see it could be you and me? 
 But if there's any doubt 
 Then I think I'll leave it out 
 'Cause I'll tell you one thing 
 You can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 Said you can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 Sometimes you keep busy reaching out for something 
 You don't care, there's always something there 
 Sometimes you can't see that all you need is one thing 
 If it's right you could sleep at night 
 But it can take some time 
 But at least I'm here in line 
 'Cause I'll tell you one thing 
 You can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 Said you can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 Sometimes you can't see that all you need is one thing 
 If it's right you could sleep at night 
 But it can take some time 
 But at least I'm here in line 
 'Cause I'll tell you one thing 
 You can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 Said you can't get what you want 
 Till you know what you want 
 I'll tell you one thing 
 You can't get what you want, what you want 
 I'll tell you one thing 
 You can't get what you want, what you wantSolo 
 It isn't a dream 
 So low 
 It's just what it seems 
 An empty thing 
 Waiting on somebody who never calls 
 Listening 
 In the night to something scratching 'round behind the walls 
 Solo 
 With no one to care 
 So low 
 The cupboards are bare 
 So now to dine 
 On three stale crackers and a fifth of gin 
 And say you're fine 
 Feeling like something that the dog dragged in 
 Oh one has to laugh 
 Still safe and warm 
 With peace of mind 
 After storms 
 Solo 
 You stare into space 
 So low 
 Scared to look at your face 
 Scared to find 
 Someone in the mirror who you can't recall 
 Pale and lined 
 Talking to himself and saying fuck 'em all 
 Though one must admit 
 Chances are few 
 To try to be 
 Someone new 
 Though one gets to play 
 With no referee 
 Peace at last 
 GuaranteedFor your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 I'd give you everything and more, and that's for sure. 
 For your love. 
 I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door. 
 For your love. 
 To thrill you with delight, I'll give you diamonds bright. 
 There'll be things that will excite, 
 To make you dream of me at night. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love, for your love, 
 I would give the stars above. 
 For your love, for your love, 
 I would give you all I could. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 I'd give the moon if it were mine to give. 
 For your love. 
 I'd give the stars and the sun 'fore I live. 
 For your love. 
 To thrill you with delight, 
 I'll give you diamonds bright. 
 There'll be things that will excite, 
 To make you dream of me at night. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love. 
 For your love.It's a hell of a town 
 Smoke coming up through the holes in the ground 
 It's a hell of a town 
 Plenty of devils for taking you down 
 Any time of night and day 
 It's a hell of a town 
 Getting drunk on the tears of a clown 
 It's a hell of a town 
 Stepping out in a bulletproof gown 
 So get out of my goddamn way 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking here 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking here 
 It's a hell of a town 
 Swimming out where the ships run aground 
 It's a hell of a town 
 Always room on the merry-go-round 
 So step up and be damned today 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking here 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking here 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking here 
 I'm walking here, I'm talking hereTried to call you yesterday 
 You were at the Monday Club 
 Or a Communist demonstration 
 Who cares 
 You're going somewhere every day 
 Vegetarians against the Klan 
 Every woman against every man 
 Never one to one 
 What's wrong 
 What's wrong with one to one 
 Just once 
 Just me and you 
 'Cause one to one is real 
 And you can't hide, just feel 
 That three's a crowd 
 I agree with what you say 
 But I don't wanna wear a badge 
 I don't wanna wave a banner like you 
 Though I don't mind it if you do 
 You're beautiful when you get mad 
 Or is that a sexist observation 
 Or one to one 
 What's wrong 
 What's wrong with one to one 
 Just once 
 Just me and you 
 'Cause one to one is real 
 And you can't hide, just feel 
 That three's a crowd 
 One to one 
 One to one 
 'Cause three's a crowdSee the bright red sports car, see the happy couple 
 See their clothes so white and their skin so pink 
 See them playing squash, gotta keep their bodies supple 
 How they kiss goodnight but tomorrow they'll be thinking 
 All day long, all day long 
 Geraldine and John 
 See the happy couple, so inseparable 
 And the beat goes on 
 And for better or for worse 
 They are married but of course 
 Not to each other 
 Geraldine and John gotta keep it under cover 
 See they scheme and sweat but it's all worthwhile 
 Now he goes back home to a wife who's not a lover 
 Now her eyes are wet but tomorrow she'll be smiling 
 All day long, all day long 
 Geraldine and John 
 See the happy couple, so inseparable 
 And the beat goes on 
 And for better or for worse 
 They are married but of course 
 Not to each other 
 And the feeling's getting stronger 
 That they can't go on much longer 
 Somewhere down the track 
 Something has to crack 
 Geraldine just packed all her things and went to mother 
 Johnny seems OK, happy wife, happy home 
 See the scar on his face from the day he met her brother 
 But nothing hurts no more, nothing more than being lonely 
 All day long, all day long 
 Geraldine and John 
 See the happy couple, so inseparable 
 And the beat goes on 
 And for better or for worse 
 They are married but of course 
 Not to each otherWell, they tell me of a pie up in the sky 
 Waiting for me when I die 
 But between the day you're born and when you die 
 You know they never seem to hear even your cry 
 So as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share now what is mine 
 And then the harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and all 
 The harder they come, harder they fall 
 One and all 
 And the oppressors are trying to track me down 
 They're trying to drive me underground 
 And they think that they have got the battle won 
 I say, forgive them, Lord, they know not what they've done 
 So as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share now what is mine 
 And then the harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and all 
 Harder they come, harder they fall 
 One and all 
 And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want 
 Though I know that when you're dead you can't 
 But I'd rather be a free man in my grave 
 Than living as a puppet or a slave 
 So as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share now what is mine 
 And then the harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and all 
 Harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and all 
 The harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and all 
 Yes, the harder they come, the harder they fall 
 One and allI never cared much for moonlit skies 
 I never winked back at fireflies 
 But now that the stars are in your eyes 
 I'm beginning to see the light 
 I never went in for afterglow 
 Or candlelight on the mistletoe 
 But now when you turn your lamp down low 
 I'm beginning to see the light 
 Used to ramble through the park 
 Shadow boxing in the dark 
 Then you came and caused a spark 
 That's a four-alarm fire now 
 I never made love by lantern shine 
 I never saw rainbows in my wine 
 But now that your lips are burning mine 
 I'm beginning to see the light 
 Used to ramble through the park 
 Shadow boxing in the dark 
 Then you came and caused a spark 
 That's a four-alarm fire now 
 I never made love by lantern shine 
 I never saw rainbows in my wine 
 But now that your lips are burning mine 
 I'm beginning to see the light 
 I'm beginning to 
 I'mDon't you feel like trying something new? 
 Don't you feel like breaking out or breaking us in two? 
 You don't do the things that I do 
 You wanna do things I can't do 
 Always something breaking us in two 
 You and I could never live alone 
 But don't you feel like breaking out just one day on your own? 
 Why does what I'm saying hurt you? 
 I didn't say that we were through 
 Always something breaking us in two 
 They say two hearts should beat as one for us 
 We'll fight it out to see it through 
 I say that won't be too much fun for us 
 Though it's oh so nice to get advice 
 It's oh so hard to do 
 Could we be much closer if we tried? 
 We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes 
 Maybe we could last an hour 
 Maybe then we'd see right through 
 Always something breaking us in two 
 They say two hearts should beat as one for us 
 We'll fight it out to see it through 
 I say that won't be too much fun for us 
 Oh, it's oh so nice to get advice 
 It's oh so hard to do 
 Could we be much closer if we tried? 
 We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes 
 Maybe we could last an hour 
 Maybe then we'd see right through 
 Always something breaking us in two 
 Always something breaking us in twoEverything is wrong since me and my baby parted 
 All day I'm walking 'cause I couldn't get my car started 
 I'm laid off from my job and I can't afford to check it 
 I wish somebody come along and run into it and wreck it 
 Come on, since my baby parted 
 Come on, I can't get started 
 Come on, I can't afford a jacket 
 I wish somebody come along and run into it and wreck it 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 I wish somebody come along and run into it and wreck it 
 Everything is wrong since I've been without you 
 All alone I'm lying here I'm thinkin' about you 
 A guy is on the phone and it sounds like thunder 
 'Cause some stupid jerk's tryin' to reach another number 
 Come on, since I've been without you 
 Come on, I always think about you 
 Come on, the phone sounds like thunder 
 Some stupid jerk's tryin' to reach another number 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 Some stupid jerk's tryin' to reach another number 
 Everything is wrong since I last saw you, baby 
 I really want to see you and I don't mean maybe 
 I've tried everything just to try to make you see 
 That I belong to you, girl, and you belong to me 
 Come on, I'm trin' to see you, baby 
 Come on, I don't mean maybe 
 Come on, I'm tryin' to make you see 
 That I belong to you and, honey, you belong to me 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 'Cause I belong to you and, honey, you belong to me 
 Come on...Never treats me sweet and gentle 
 The way he should 
 I got it bad and that ain't good 
 My poor heart is sentimental 
 Not made of wood 
 I got it bad and that ain't good 
 But when the weekend's over 
 And Monday rolls around 
 I end up like I start out 
 Just crying my heart out 
 He don't love me like I love him 
 Nobody could 
 I got it bad and that ain't good 
 Though folks with good intentions 
 Tell me to save my tears 
 I'm glad I'm mad about him 
 I can't live without him 
 Lord above me 
 Make him love me 
 The way he should 
 I got it bad and that ain't good 
 Like a lonely weeping willow 
 Lost in the wood 
 The things I tell my pillow 
 Nobody should 
 I got it bad and that ain't goodIf I could see your face 
 The face of the girl behind the veil 
 I'd ask you if it feels like a guarantee 
 To keep you down or keep you safe 
 Or just keep you pale 
 But what makes me think you'd even talk to me 
 But respect, respect 
 Respect my culture 
 We're all a part of the human race 
 Questions, questions 
 Would you answer 
 If I could 
 If I could 
 If I could see your face 
 The face of the man in a German jail 
 I'd ask you how your sister ran out of luck 
 How you and your brothers tracked her down 
 'Cause she was living with a German male 
 And how you could kill your own sister - you evil fuck 
 But respect, respect 
 Respect your culture 
 We're all a part of the human race 
 Questions, questions 
 Would you answer 
 If I could 
 If I could 
 If I could see your face 
 How can I see your faceYou know we gotta have to face up to the facts 
 Youre just another face in a big crowd 
 You know we gotta try hard to relax 
 We can laugh but not too loud 
 It's never like you see in a magazine 
 And you don't even know what you mean to me 
 And I don't understand this feeling 
 But I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 Tonight and forever 
 You drive me crazy and you say that you'll never change 
 And I could never do what you want to 
 Don't you find the whole thing a little strange 
 I don't even know if I like you 
 It's never like you see on a movie screen 
 But there's something that you do to me 
 And I'm not sure that I believe it 
 But I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 Tonight and forever 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 I wanna be with you tonight 
 Tonight and forever 
 Tonight and forever 
 Tonight and foreverI've just been to see my best friend 
 He's found another girl 
 Says she's just about the best thing 
 In the whole damn world 
 And he says, "Can't you see 
 What the little lady's done for me?" 
 Says it like he thinks I'm blind 
 But the things that you see 
 Ain't necessarily the things you can find 
 Happy loving couples make it look so easy 
 Happy loving couples always talk so kind 
 Till the time that I can do my dancing with a partner 
 Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine 
 People say I'm too damn fussy 
 When it comes to girls 
 Happy couples say I must live 
 In a lonely world 
 Wanna be, wanna really be 
 What my friends pretend to be 
 Be it in my own good time 
 Being kind to myself 
 Till I become one of two of a kind 
 But those happy loving couples make it look so easy 
 Happy loving couples always talk so kind 
 Till the time that I can do my dancing with a partner 
 Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine 
 You ain't no friends of mine

 Happy loving couples 
 In matching lamb turtleneck sweaters 
 Reading Ideal Homes magazine

 Right, that's enoughYou make a guy feel humble 
 I make a fool of myself again 
 You make me trip and stumble 
 Just go dance by yourself again 
 I'll just watch 
 'Cause that's all I wanna do 
 But remember 
 That I'm here with your drink 
 At my table for two 
 And you're kinda kute baby, kinda kute baby 
 See you dance in your satin suit baby 
 When you move gotta sit right down 
 No competition with 
 This kinda kutie around 
 I see you pass by my window 
 Have to run down the stairs again 
 I fix my hair around a corner 
 Catch you quite unawares again 
 And you laugh 
 And you move that way again 
 Just like last night, oh yeah that's right 
 I'm the guy with the big feet 
 But plenty of nerve 
 And you're kinda kute baby, kinda kute baby 
 See you dance in your satin suit baby 
 When you move gotta sit right down 
 No competition with 
 This kinda kutie around 
 Don't you know that 
 All you gotta do is remember 
 That I'm here with my drink 
 At my table for two

 I think I hear the president 
 The Pied Piper of the TV screen 
 Is gonna make it simple 
 And he's got it all mapped out 
 And illustrated with cartoons 
 Too hard for clever folks to understand 
 Yeah, they're more used to words like 
 Ideology 
 But they say it's not the issue 
 Ideology 
 They're not talkin' 'bout right or left 
 They're talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Between the right and the left and the east and the west 
 What you know and the things that you'll never see 
 So what ya think 
 You like the Yankees or the Mets this year? 
 And what about this latest war of words? 
 What about the commies? 
 You know I saw the news last night 
 All illustrated with cartoons 
 So when they come with that opinion poll 
 Yeah, they better not use words like 
 Ideology 
 Or try to tell me 'bout the issues 
 Ideology 
 Whose side are you on 
 'Cause we're talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Between the right and the left and the east and the west 
 What you know and the things that you'll never see 
 Where are we 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Right and wrong 
 Do you know the difference 
 Between the right and the left and the east and the west 
 What you know and the things that you'll never seeWhen you're fixing your makeup 
 You know you take too long 
 And when you mix me a drink up 
 You know you mix it too strong 
 And when you fix me a breakfast 
 You know you fix it too late 
 With the wrong kind of eggcup 
 And the wrong kind of plate 
 But honey look at your eyes 
 You got the innocent eyes 
 Oh, it's the innocent eyes 
 And now you're asking me why 
 I'm mad at you 
 Mad at you 
 So come on, what's your problem 
 You know we'll miss half the show 
 How come I'm walking so fast 
 How come your walking so slow 
 And after fixing your makeup 
 For an hour and a half 
 You say your new shoes are hurting 
 And you expect me to laugh 
 But honey look at your eyes 
 You got the innocent eyes 
 Oh, it's the innocent eyes 
 And now you're asking me why 
 I'm mad at you 
 Mad at you 
 At you 
 I'm so, I'm so mad at you 
 Mad at you 
 With the innocent eyes 
 With the innocent eyes 
 Innocent eyes 
 So come on 
 So come on watch in public 
 I'm so, I'm so... 
 Mad at you 
 Innocent eyes 
 Innocent eyesDon't make me sad 
 Talking 'bout tomorrow 
 It's not so bad 
 We were doing fine just then 
 You'll move on up, you'll move on out 
 And you won't cry 
 'Cause your amateur hour is over 
 You're only going where I've been 
 And you'll see what I've seen 
 You're no amateur, amateur 
 You know if someone likes your face 
 You'd be a fool to stay strictly amateur 
 It's strictly for amateurs 
 The world could be a better place 
 If some of us could stay 
 Amateurs 
 There's no more time 
 To think about the way ahead 
 Just miss one line 
 Fall over, you'll be left for dead 
 Your heart will play no part except 
 When memories of your amateur hour take over 
 Then screw yourself into a ball 
 And keep it rolling on 
 You're no amateur, amateur 
 You know if someone likes your face 
 You'd be a fool to stay strictly amateur 
 It's strictly for amateurs 
 The world could be a better place 
 If some of us could stay 
 Amateurs 
 Don't make me sad 
 It's not so badYou told me you would meet me at the station gate 
 For our honeymoon excursion 
 You told me you would meet me at the station gate 
 But I got a different version 
 Train number one is gone 
 Train number two is gone 
 Train number three is been gone 
 How long must I wait for you? 
 Train number four is gone 
 Train number five is gone 
 Train number six is been gone 
 How long must I wait for you? 
 I got tickets and a reservation set for two 
 Luggage waiting on the track 
 But I got no use for reservations without you 
 I gotta give the tickets back 
 'Cause train number one is back 
 Train number two is back 
 Train number three is been back

 Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty 
 Been down, isn't it a pity 
 Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city 
 All around me people looking half-dead 
 Walking on the sidewalk 
 Hotter than a match head 
 But the night is a different world 
 Go out and find a girl 
 Come on, come on you dance all right 
 Despite the heat it'll be all right 
 And hey, don't you know it's a pity 
 That the days can't be like the nights 
 In the summer, in the city 
 In the summer, in the city 
 In the summer, in the city 
 In the summer, in the city... 
 Cool town, evening in the city 
 Dressing so fine and looking so pretty 
 Cool cat, looking for a kitty 
 Gonna look in every corner of the city 
 Turn around, I'm wheezing at the bus stop 
 Running up the stairs 
 Gonna meet you on the rooftop 
 But the night is a different world 
 Go out and find a girl 
 Come on, come on you dance all right 
 Despite the heat it'll be all right 
 And hey, don't you know it's a pity 
 That the days can't be like the nights

 Can I take your picture for the people back home 
 They won't believe it when they see this stuff 
 You see the camera that I got in Hong Kong 
 Completely duty-free 
 This really is a pretty scene 
 But could you ask your kid to smile, please? 
 Sorry, what exactly do you mean? 
 Can you say it in English? 
 'Cause we're the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 And don't be messin' with the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 'Cause we got a lot of things to see 
 Let's get a Big Mac 
 Get it while the dollar's worth a thousand yen 
 It's quite a bargain here 
 Next year 
 We'll save some money and we'll hire Big Ben 
 For our anniversary 
 This really is a pretty place 
 But I'm happy I don't live here 
 Hey, what's the matter with the waiter's face? 
 Can you say it in English? 
 'Cause we're the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 And don't be messin' with the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 We got a lot of things to see 
 We're the jet set 
 Don't be messing with the jet set 
 Jet set 
 We're the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 And don't be messin' with the jet set 
 Get out of our way 
 You know we got a lot of things to seeWell, things are getting bad now 
 Since your woman left you, just can't do without it 
 The other day you even read a book 
 That tells you how to go about it 
 It says to join an evening class 
 Or hang around in zoos and railway stations 
 And gives you lots of lines to use 
 And how to make the best of situations 
 You know it's just a bunch of crap, you used to do okay 
 But that was long ago and far away 
 And you got a fever 
 You got the fever 
 You gotta love her 
 And you gotta leave her 
 It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey) 
 Let's call it something polite 
 Like the fever of love 
 Fever of love 
 The girls that want you you don't want 
 The girls you want, they never seem to want you 
 The girls at work are married 
 And the girls at dances never seem to want to 
 The girls in bars are always with a friend 
 Or waitin' for their new fiancé 
 And you tell the barmaid you're just lonely 
 She just smiles and says, "That's what they all say" 
 So you look up some old number you said you'd never use 
 And tell yourself you win instead of lose 
 You got a fever 
 You got the fever 
 You gotta love her 
 And you gotta leave her 
 It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey) 
 Let's call it something polite 
 Like the fever of love 
 Fever of love 
 You got a fever 
 You got a fever 
 You gotta love her 
 And you gotta leave her 
 It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey) 
 Let's call it something polite 
 Like the fever of love 
 Fever of loveLazy Gilly was a flower child 
 All the summer 
 Calmly running wild 
 She'd be silly and her friends just smiled 
 Pass the bottle 
 Wash the pills down, what went wrong 
 What went wrong 
 She don't care no more 
 She don't need to fight it 
 She don't care no more 
 She gets paid on Friday 
 Cooler weather, it's not cool to smile 
 Pretty colours 
 Going out of style 
 It ain't so bad when you get used to it 
 Once you clock in 
 You'll take any shit, all right 
 Ain't that right 
 She don't care no more 
 She don't need to fight it 
 She don't care no more 
 She gets paid on Friday 
 Monday morning 
 Friday's far away 
 Pray you'll make it 
 It's a magic day 
 Bells will ring and you'll go out to play 
 Spend your money 
 Pass the bottle 
 Friday rules 
 Friday rules OK 
 Ain't talking 'bout Monday 
 Ain't talking 'bout Tuesday 
 Ain't talking 'bout Wednesday 
 Ain't talking 'bout Thursday 
 I'm talking 'bout... 
 What day do we get down here at the disco? 
 (Friday!) 
 She don't care no more 
 She don't need to fight it 
 She don't care no more 
 She gets paid on Friday 
 She gets paid on Friday 
 Friday, Friday...So you say 
 And I agree 
 You're a prize, but not for me 
 There'll be no more lies now 
 So you say 
 I'm a fool 
 You're a sage 
 Yes I'll try to act my age 
 This is no surprise now 
 So you say 
 And I thought I knew what went on in my heart 
 Till you taught me I would never have been smart 
 Enough to leave you 
 Tell me once 
 Not again 
 Take a breath and count to ten 
 Time to say goodbye now 
 So you say 
 And I thought I knew what went on in my mind 
 Till you brought me to my senses I was blind 
 Enough to love you 
 So you say 
 And it's true 
 I'm not so bad, but not for you 
 It'll all be fine now 
 So you say 
 Tell me once 
 Not again 
 Take a breath and count to ten 
 Time to say goodbye now 
 So you saySee the guy in the corner 
 The one who's drinking another glass 
 There's a look in his eye 
 That I've seen so many times in the past 
 I've seen it in the mirror 
 And I've seen it in my friends 
 When we realize we've lost ourselves 
 And we try to make amends 
 He'll drink another two or three 
 And the room will start to spin 
 Then he'll try to let the feelings show 
 But he'll find he can't give in 
 You remember what your brother said 
 Remember what your brother said 
 "I'll tell the whole class if I see you" 
 You remember what your mother said 
 Remember what your mother said 
 "Never be a man if you do" 
 Now he's trying to cry 
 Now he's trying to cry 
 See the guy in the corner 
 Putting out another cigarette 
 Maybe someone is dying 
 From something that they can't cure yet 
 Maybe a lover is cheating 
 Maybe a lover just left 
 But something's gone, maybe forever 
 And it's something that he can't forget 
 You remember what your brother said 
 Remember what your brother said 
 "I'll tell the whole class if I see you" 
 You remember what your mother said 
 Remember what your mother said 
 "Never be a man if you do" 
 Now he's trying to cry 
 Now he's trying to cryPretty soon now 
 You know I'm gonna make a comeback 
 And like the birds and the bees in the trees 
 It's a sure-fire smash 
 I'll speak 
 To the masses through the media 
 And if you got anything to say to me 
 You can say it with cash 
 'Cause I've got the trash 
 And you got the cash 
 So baby we should get along fine 
 So give me all your money 
 'Cause I know you think I'm funny 
 Can't you hear me laughing 
 Can't you see me smile 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the hula hoop 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo 
 Kung fu 
 Well that was one of my good ones 
 Well what's a few broken bones when we all know 
 It's good clean fun 
 Skateboards 
 I've almost made them respectable 
 You see, I can't always get through to you 
 So I go for your son 
 I had a giant rubber shark 
 And it really made a mark 
 Did you looka looka lookit all the blood 
 So give me all your money 
 'Cause I know you think I'm funny 
 Can't you hear me laughing 
 Can't you see me smile 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the hula hoop 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo 
 Right now 
 I think I'm gonna plan a new trend 
 Because the line on the graph's getting low 
 And we can't have that 
 And you think you're immune 
 But I can sell you anything 
 Anything from a thin safety pin to a porkpie hat 
 'Cause I've got the trash 
 And you got the cash 
 So baby we should get along fine 
 Why don't you give me all your money 
 'Cause I know you think I'm funny 
 Can't you hear me laughing 
 Can't you see me smile 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the hula hoop 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the hula hoop 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo 
 I'm the man, I'm the man 
 I'm the man, I'm the man 
 I'm the man, I'm the man 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the man 
 That's meJust think of the millions and millions of people 
 Who could have existed but didn't exist 
 Yet here we are 
 And the millions and millions of planets and stars 
 Never listed on anyone's list 
 And here we are 
 But oh, what a life it is 
 Oh, what can we do 
 With you 
 Poor thing, everything's tragic today 
 And your life's a mess 
 Poor thing, maybe you like it that way 
 That could make sense, I guess 
 Just think of the millions and millions of horrible things 
 That can happen, that happen each day 
 But on we go 
 There must still be a few million chances 
 That just a few things could still turn out okay 
 So on we go 
 But oh, what a life it is 
 Oh, what can we do 
 With you 
 Poor thing, everything's tragic today 
 And your life's a mess 
 Poor thing, maybe you like it that way 
 That could make sense, I guess 
 Poor thing, everything's tragic today 
 And your life's a mess 
 Poor thing, maybe you like it that way 
 That could make sense, I guessWake up, got another day to get through now 
 Got another man to see 
 Gotta call him on the telephone, ey oh 
 Gotta find a piece of paper 
 Sit down, got another letter to write 
 Think hard, gotta get a letter just right 
 There's a ringing on the telephone, oh no 
 Gotta write a little later 
 No such day as tomorrow only 
 One-two-three go! 
 Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
 Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
 Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
 Tickin' in my head 
 Tickin' in my head 
 Tickin' in my head 
 If I tell you what I'm doing today 
 Will you shut up and get out of my way 
 Someone asked me what the time is, I don't know 
 Only know I gotta go now 
 No time, trying to get a watch repaired 
 No time, never got a thing to wear 
 Hear the ringin' of the telephone, no no 
 Hear a ringin' in my head now 
 No such day as tomorrow only 
 One-two-three go! 
 Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head

 Every time we have a date 
 But I love her 
 Yes, I love her 
 I'm gonna walk right up to her gate 
 And see if I can get it straight 
 'Cause I want her 
 I'm gonna ask her 
 Is you is or is you ain't my baby? 
 Way you're acting lately makes me doubt 
 Youse is still my baby, baby 
 Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out 
 A woman is a creature that has always been strange 
 Just when you're sure of one 
 You find she's gone and made a change 
 Is you is or is you ain't my baby? 
 Maybe baby's found somebody new 
 Or is my baby still my baby true? 
 Is you is or is you ain't my baby? 
 Way you're acting lately makes me doubt 
 Youse is still my baby, baby 
 Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out 
 A woman is a creature that has always been strange 
 Just when you're sure of one 
 You find she's gone and made a change 
 Is you is or is you ain't my baby? 
 Maybe baby's found somebody new 
 Or is my baby still my baby true?Time 
 A million tiny lights are strung across the western sky 
 They burn to light our mission 
 But it's just a million lonely hearts 
 Strung out from never asking why 
 We burn with blind ambition 
 I heard somebody say 
 I don't regret my wedding day 
 But something's wrong 
 It's not the same 
 I'm lonely and I'd start again 
 If I had the time 
 Precious time 
 But I don't ask that much 
 Just to keep in touch 
 And waste a little of your precious time 
 Waste a little of your precious time 
 A million dollars never justified a million lies 
 To jockey for position 
 And if two hearts can't beat as one 
 How can a billion souls survive 
 In this world of suspicion 
 I heard somebody say 
 I dream about my wedding day 
 Through lonely nights 
 I dream of you 
 A lover though a friend would do 
 I'd find him if I had the time 
 Precious time 
 And I don't ask that much 
 Just to keep in touch 
 And waste a little of your precious time 
 Waste a little of your precious time 
 And I don't ask that much 
 Just to keep in touch 
 And waste a little of your precious time 
 And just a smile's enough 
 Just some of that human stuff 
 And waste a little of your precious time 
 Precious timeSome days I can't get started 
 Wondering which shoe to put on first 
 Or should I brush my teeth 
 Before or after I put on my shirt 
 So many big decisions 
 Boiled or scrambled, fried or even raw 
 I'm so damn open-minded 
 Used to think I'm lucky but I'm cursed 
 I’m cursed 
 I hate this supermarket 
 But I have to say it makes me think 
 A hundred mineral waters 
 Fun to guess which ones are safe to drink 
 Two hundred brands of cookies 
 Eighty-seven kinds of chocolate chip 
 They say that choice is freedom 
 I'm so free it drives me to the brink 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 It's all too much for me to bear 
 What kind of shampoo suits my hair 
 It's just too much for me to do 
 Especially without you 
 Please come home 
 Honey, please come home 
 I read the morning paper 
 But it all changes by the evening news 
 The world got so much smaller 
 I don't know which piece of it to choose 
 I'd like to fight apartheid 
 Wish that I could fight the guy upstairs 
 I'd solve a dozen cases 
 If only there weren't so many clues 
 Too many clues 
 What shall we do this evening 
 Send out for some sushi and champagne 
 Stay in and watch TV 
 Fifty channels can't all be the same 
 Maybe go to a movie 
 Fifty films on fifty tiny screens 
 They say that choice is freedom 
 I'm so free it's driving me insane 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 It's all too much for me to stand 
 So much supply and no demand 
 There's just too much to struggle through 
 Especially without you 
 Please come home 
 Honey, please come home 
 I'd like to get to know 
 All the many people I could be 
 If I just had the time 
 I'm sure I could find out which one is me 
 Maybe I need religion 
 Or meditation till I disappear 
 They say that choice is freedom 
 I'm so free I'm stuck in therapy 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 And you know why 
 It's all too much 
 It's all too much for me to take 
 Try to be real, feel like a fake 
 It's all too much to follow through 
 Especially without you 
 Please come home 
 Honey, please come home 
 Won't you please come homeSunday evening down the penny arcade 
 I see your face in the pinball game 
 Put in a quarter and it starts to fade 
 Tell myself it won't appear again 
 But this is just another game I've played so badly 
 Right from the start 
 And through the bells and buzzers you're still singing sadly 
 It tears me apart 
 The higher you fly, the farther you gotta fall 
 Tilt 
 You're pushing too hard 
 Try just another ball 
 Tilt 
 So why's it so hard 
 Keeping it under control 
 Take it easy, take your time, you said 
 Take me home, I'll see you soon enough 
 You say I'm pushing but it's in your head 
 I feel so helpless, you say I'm so tough 
 And now we fight it out until I just can't hear you 
 I can't understand 
 When all I want is just permission to be near you 
 Holding your hand 
 But nobody said 
 The lights would keep flashing red 
 Tilt 
 You're pushing too hard 
 Try just another ball 
 Tilt 
 So why's it so hard 
 Keeping it under control 
 Keeping it under control 
 Keeping it under control 
 Keeping it under controlI can't help about the shape I'm in 
 I can't sing, I ain't pretty, and my legs are thin 
 But don't ask me what I think of you 
 I might not give the answer that you want me to 
 Oh well 
 And when I talk to God I know He'll understand 
 He says, "Stick by me, I'll be your guiding hand 
 But don't ask me what I think of you 
 I might not give the answer that you want me to" 
 Oh wellWhat good is melody, what good is music 
 If it ain't possessin' something sweet 
 It ain't the melody, it ain't the music 
 It's something else that makes the tune complete 
 What good is melody, what good is music 
 If it ain't possessin' something sweet 
 It ain't the melody, it ain't the music 
 It's something else that makes the tune complete 
 It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing 
 It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing 
 It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot 
 Just give that rhythm everything you got 
 It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing 
 It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot 
 Just give that rhythm everything you got 
 It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing 
 It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is singI was so low 
 People almost made me give up trying 
 Always said no 
 Then I turned around, saw someone smiling 
 I stepped into, I stepped into 
 Into another, into another 
 I stepped into, I stepped into 
 Into another, into another world 
 There was no light 
 I was going to all the wrong places 
 Like day from night 
 Suddenly I saw a thousand faces 
 I stepped into, I stepped into 
 Into another, into another 
 I stepped into, I stepped into 
 Into another, into another worldI've got some walls around me, too 
 But they're not much compared to your house 
 Fifty-feet high with barbed wire 
 Guards on the top 
 Aiming rifles at your lovers one by one 
 And friends, too 
 I've come with hands above my head 
 But I'm damned if I'll try to break your door down 
 If you ever come out, just call me 
 I'll still be armed 
 With the memory of one evening when you smiled 
 At something 
 Sadness spreads like a black stain 
 But I know by now 
 That's not all there is 
 There's a blue flame inside of you 
 So beautiful and rare 
 Love's not something we decide to do 
 You'd be so hard to love 
 If love was not just 
 There 
 You tell me women get you down 
 And as for men, well they're all bastards 
 I wonder what world you call home 
 And I wish I could learn their language 
 Just enough to make you laugh 
 Just one time 
 Yes, it was nice to see you, too 
 Although I'm never sure you mean it 
 I'll pick up the tab and you won't thank me 
 Not that I mind 
 But in my dreams it's all so different, we even kiss 
 Imagine this 
 Bitterness is a black hole 
 Don't you know by now 
 You've got more to give 
 There's a blue flame inside of you 
 So beautiful and rare 
 Love's not something we decide to do 
 You'd be so hard to love 
 If love was not just 
 There's a blue flame inside of you 
 So beautiful and rare 
 Love's not something we decide to do 
 You'd be so hard to love 
 If love was not just 
 There 
 Impossible to love 
 If love was not 
 For some strange reason 
 ThereImpossible to see 
 Impossible to show 
 Impossible to verify 
 Impossible to know 
 When she'll come or go 
 There's nothing you can do to make her real 
 Friends and lovers know 
 Don't say no when you feel 
 Joy 
 Impossible to touch 
 Impossible to hear 
 Impossible to prophesy 
 Impossible to fear 
 If she comes or goes 
 It's nothing that you did to make her real 
 Friends and lovers know 
 Just don't say no when you feel 
 Joy 
 When she'll come or go 
 There's nothing you can do to make her real 
 Friends and lovers know 
 Don't say no when you feel 
 JoyIn my solitude you haunt me 
 With reveries of days gone by 
 In my solitude you touch me 
 With memories that never dieYou always were the special one 
 The breath of air, the heap of fun 
 You always had a kind of light 
 That might dismay, or might delight 
 I thought about you all along 
 I used to doubt you 
 Guess I was wrong 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're a star and bold like chrome 
 And from Tokyo to Rome 
 We're all aware of you 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're so hard and cold like chrome 
 And I'd like to take you home 
 But I'm scared of you 
 It's nice to see you looking well 
 I know your age, but I won't tell 
 You always had a kind of glow 
 You're luminous 
 But I guess you know 
 I see it clearly 
 You're gonna shine 
 I never really thought you'd be mine 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're a star and bold like chrome 
 And from Tokyo to Rome 
 We're all aware of you 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're so hard and cold like chrome 
 And I'd like to take you home 
 But I'm scared of you 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're a star and bold like chrome 
 And from Tokyo to Rome 
 We're all aware of you 
 Now you shine like chrome 
 You're so hard and cold like chrome 
 And I'd like to take you home 
 But I'm scared of youJumpin' with my boss Sid in the city 
 Jumpin' with my boss Sid in the city 
 Mr. President of that DJ committee 
 We're gonna be up all night gettin' witty 
 We want you to spin the sounds from the city 
 Far down in the land that's real real pretty 
 Let everything go real crazy over jazz 
 Make everything go real crazy over jazz 
 Let everything cool for me and my baby 
 I don't wanna think we're listening too lazy 
 It's gotta be Pressburg cheering all the Basie 
 It's gotta get it all set right clear on the eighty 
 Let it roll 
 Let it rollAt a bar on 43rd at quarter to two 
 Met my friend the Chinese Elvis and hoisted a few 
 He talks like Mickey Mouse 
 And sees with X-ray eyes 
 Lives in a cardboard house 
 I almost gave him the prize 
 Till you 
 Came along, thanks for opening my eyes 
 Things you do, right or wrong 
 It should come as no surprise 
 When you live in a town where there's always somebody 
 Stranger than you 
 Stranger than you 
 At 83rd and Amsterdam there's an Indian Jew 
 Who pierced all his private parts with a permanent screw 
 He sleeps on a bed of nails 
 Which came from outer space 
 And in my taller tales 
 I gave him pride of place 
 Till you 
 Came along, thanks for opening my eyes 
 Things you do, right or wrong 
 It should come as no surprise 
 When you live in a town where there's always somebody 
 Stranger than you 
 Stranger than you 
 I'm not complaining even though 
 I'm not sure what you are 
 I've got the strangest feeling good 
 About this love bizarre 
 I could have stayed in bed 
 Hiding from this freaky show 
 I'm happy that instead 
 I knew just where to go 
 When you 
 Came along, thanks for opening my eyes 
 Things you do, right or wrong 
 It should come as no surprise 
 When you live in a town where there's always somebody 
 Stranger than you

 But I try 
 Why Empire State Building green 
 Tell me why 
 Why house is smell of gasoline

 Fools in love, is there any other kind of pain?

 Something big 
 Something I can't stand 
 Dark as the ocean 
 Secret and cruel 
 Something I can't command 
 Something's waiting 
 Down a mugger's alley 
 To see what's on my mind 
 Take a deep breath 
 Start walking faster 
 It's dark, but I'm not blind 
 You never know 
 If I push at this wall 
 My hand could pass through 
 So this cloud of unknowing 
 Could disappear too 
 It's only the future 
 Only the futureJunkie diva, won't you sing for me 
 I'm so happy, can't you set me free 
 Anything you tell me, it's got to be real 
 Can you tell me how I feel 
 Junkie diva, won't you sing the blues 
 Sing like someone with nothing left to lose 
 I can really see you when I hear you scream 
 I could nearly be you in my dreams 
 Now now, I'm going down

 Look into the darkness 
 And tell me what you see

 I don't want to fight

 Where's that tiger? 
 Where's that tiger? 
 Where's that tiger? 
 Where's that tiger? 
 Where's that tiger? 
 Where's that tiger?We walked out one autumn evening 
 Someone up there made a fair appear 
 Coloured lights that caught our eyes 
 And reggae music caught our ears 
 We laughed as they played all the songs 
 We wanted least of all to hear 
 I guess that's when I knew 
 That we'd be more than just good friends 
 It happened just by chance 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the sun and sea 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there brought my girl to me 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the wind and rain 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there took her back again 
 And just for once 
 You can't fight back 
 No messing with the hand of fate 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 The paper ran an ad that had you running 
 To the other side of town 
 Working for a man I never could make out 
 Who started hanging 'round 
 Someone up there got me drinking, got me drunk 
 And made me put him down 
 The way you looked at me I knew 
 That we'd be coming to an end 
 It happened just by chance 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the sun and sea 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there brought my girl to me 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the wind and rain 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there took her back again 
 And just for once 
 You can't fight back 
 No messing with the hand of fate 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 I guess that's when I knew 
 That we'd be coming to an end 
 It happened just by chance 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the sun and sea 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there brought my girl to me 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there makes the wind and rain 
 Someone up there 
 Someone up there took her back again 
 And just for once 
 You can't fight back 
 No messing with the hand of fate 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no, oh no...In the mirror when I'm debonair 
 My reactions are my own affair 
 A body likes to be near the phone 
 Oh Nancy, Leslie, Jack, and Joan 
 I die when I'm alone 
 Shake your booty when your back is bent 
 Put your feelings where my mouth just went 
 As serious as things do seem 
 At least you've put me on the team 
 And friends do rule supreme 
 Oh, pardon you, me 
 With a capital 'C' 
 And who would have thought 
 With a capital ought 
 In between the lines 
 Speak of chickens when you think of next 
 What the Dickens if they're highly sexed 
 Through channels that were once canals 
 Do lift the heart of my morale 
 To hope that we are pals 
 Oh, vanity fair with a capital 'V' 
 You give me a share 
 You take it from me 
 Oh, jolly good show with a capital 'O' 
 It's terrific to go 
 Hello 
 Hello, hello, helloBlack nigger, white nigger standing in the dark 
 Listen to the rhythm of the bass boom 
 Black nigger takes a hit sending up a spark 
 In the dark heat 
 Swaying a little to the bass beat 
 White nigger takes a hit, takes money out 
 Says this is what it's all about 
 Rots your brain - who cares 
 Black nigger stares 
 White nigger sighs 
 I like your music 
 I like your style 
 I crack a joke, so why don't you smile 
 White niggers dancing out on the floor tonight 
 The band's not good but the beat seems right 
 The band's all black and the floor's all white 
 Clenching fists unite and fight 
 Rock Against Racism rules tonight 
 But in the real world 
 No one rules 
 But fists are clenched all right 
 Down in the Underground 
 Out in the playground 
 The common ground 
 Is a battleground 
 Now you don't have to be black to be a nigger no more 
 The writing's on the wall 
 Say, black is power 
 White is flower 
 Divided we fall 
 And behind the wall 
 Behind the door 
 In the dark heat 
 In the rhythm of the bass beat 
 Something is wrong 
 And no one is taking the blameMoonlight, starlight, star bright 
 I think I see my shadow on the wall 
 Moonlight, silence, and silver 
 I think I hear a footstep in the hall 
 I know it's only make-believe, pretend 
 I think the moonlight is my friend 
 But sometimes I'm not sure 
 Moonlight 
 I know it's only make-believe, pretend 
 I think the moonlight is my friend 
 But sometimes I'm not sureHere she comes, just a-walk, just 
 Just a-walkin' down the street singin’ 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 Hey! 
 I took a walk 'round the market downtown 
 Taking it easy, just to see what I could find 
 I found the girls there, long legs and blond hair 
 All getting set to make a mess out of my mind 
 Hey! Eyes left! 
 I got the hard word, you know what I heard 
 They say the miniskirt is comin' back in style 
 I say it's not fair, but what do they care? 
 When you've got power then you use it for a while 
 Hey! Eyes right! 
 See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 Down do be do do wop - wop 
 God, if you're up there, listen to my prayer 
 In future man should have a different design 
 Give him a switch so he can turn off his libido now 
 Give him a tranquilizer built into his mind 
 Hey! Eyes right! 
 See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop (on their feet) 
 Down do be do do wop - wop 
 Don't talk to me about women's liberation 
 They already got me right just where it hurts 
 Here she comes, just a-walk, just 
 Just a-walkin' down the street singin’ 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop 
 See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet 
 Down do be do do wop, a do do wop, a do do wop (on their feet) 
 Down do be do do wop - wopWhat the hell is wrong with you tonight? 
 I can't seem to say or do the right thing 
 Wanted to be sure you're feeling right 
 Wanted to be sure we want the same thing 
 She said 
 I can't believe it 
 You can't 
 Possibly mean it 
 Don't we 
 All want the same thing 
 Don't we 
 Well who said anything about love 
 No, not love, she said 
 Don't you know that it's different for girls?

 Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
 You're all the same

 Don't bite the hand or it won't feed

 You can't go back 
 You've booked the band 
 So take your partner by the hand

 Cha cha locoShe had a horror of rooms, she was tired, you can't hide beat 
 When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home 
 She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do 
 And she do 
 She opened strange doors that we'd never close again 
 She began to wail, jealousies scream 
 Waiting at the lights, know what I mean 
 Scary monsters, super creeps 
 Keep me running, running scared 
 Scary monsters, super creeps 
 Keep me running, running scared 
 She asked me to stay and I stole her room 
 She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind 
 Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialize 
 Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies 
 She wails 
 Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousies scream 
 Waiting at the lights, know what I mean 
 Scary monsters, super creeps 
 Keep me running, running scared

 Ain't got no bounce in my shoes 
 Ain't go no fancy to tickle 
 I ain't got nothing but the blues 
 Ain't got no coffee that's perking 
 Ain't got no winnings to lose 
 Ain't got a dream that is working 
 I ain't got nothing but the blues 
 When trumpets flare up 
 I keep my hair up 
 I just can't make it come down 
 Believe me peppie 
 I can't get happy 
 Since my ever loving baby left town 
 Ain't got no rest in my slumbers 
 Ain't got no feelings to bruise 
 Ain't got no telephone numbers 
 I ain't got nothing but the blues 
 Ain't got no coffee that's perking 
 Ain't got no winnings to lose 
 Ain't got a dream that is working 
 I ain't got nothing but the blues 
 When trumpets flare up 
 I keep my hair up

 I can't get happy

 On my TV screen 
 Teeth so white and hair so clean 
 Pretty boys 
 Sing and play guitars 
 Pretty boys get to be big stars 
 How do you rate my sex appeal from one to ten 
 Is my image just a bit confusing 
 Maybe I should get a facelift, start again 
 Maybe I should trade my pointed shoes in 
 'Cause talent don't count for

 I wanna see a human being on my TV set 
 Want some action for the fat and thin man

 No brains and no heart

 Pretty boysIt happened one night at three in the morning 
 The Devil appeared in my studio room 
 And he said, "I'm your pal and I'll make you a deal 
 Blow away all your struggle and take your soul for a toy" 
 After rubbing my eyes I looked all around me 
 At the half-finished drivel I'd worked on for days 
 And I told him my dream was to live for all time 
 In some perfect refrain like the man who wrote Danny Boy 
 And I said, "If you're real, then I'll ask you a question 
 While most of us turn into ashes or dust 
 Just you and that other guy go on forever 
 But who writes the history and who do I trust?" 
 He gave me a wink and he said it was funny 
 How mortals would pour all their blood, sweat, and tears 
 Onto tape, onto paper or into the air 
 To be lost and forgotten outside of his kind employ 
 Then I thought I could hear a great sound in the distance 
 Of whiskey-soaked singing and laughter and cheers 
 And they're saying that song could bring tears to a glass eye 
 So pass me the papers, I'll sign them in blood 
 And the smell of the brimstone was turned into greasepaint 
 And the roar of the crowd like the Furies of Hell 
 And I hear the applause and I hear the bells ringing 
 And the sound of a woman's voice from the next room, saying 
 "Come to me now, come lay down beside me 
 Whatever you're doing, you're too gone to see 
 You can't hold onto shadows, no more than to years 
 So be glad for the pleasures we're young enough to enjoy" 
 So maybe I'm drunk or maybe a liar 
 Or maybe we're all living inside a dream 
 You can say what you like; when I'm gone, then you'll see 
 I'll be down in the dark, down underground 
 With Shakespeare and Bach and the man who wrote Danny Boy(Livin') 
 And the time is right 
 (Livin') 
 And tonight's the night 
 (Livin') 
 Alreed, all right

 If I don't get too scared 
 I'll never neglect you 
 If my feelings are shared 
 I'll be right behind you 
 If you don't move too fast 
 And I'll try to remind you 
 That some things can last 
 I'll love you forever 
 Or at least many years 
 If you know I'll never 
 Take away all your fears 
 And I'll never roam 
 Not unless I have to 
 But I'll always come home 
 That's the best I can do 
 It's the best I can doDV = deep voice, SV = squeaky voice 
 DV: Boy, you listen to your old Pappy 
 SV: Yeah, Pappy 
 DV: And stop drinking so much 
 SV: I, I ain't been doing so much drinking, Pappy- 
 DV: Shut up, boy. You drink all day and you drink all night 
 And son you know that that ain't right 
 SV: Oh, Pappy, you just give me a chance. I, I can- 
 DV: Shut up, boy. Boy, you're lookin' thin as a twig 
 SV: I know that 
 DV: Look likes your dear old Pappy about to blow your wig 
 SV: Oh, I'm gonna blow my wig, Pappy 
 What's the use of getting sober 
 When you're gonna get drunk again 
 Oh, Sam done something fine 
 When he bought that good whiskey, beer, and wine 
 I love my whiskey and I love my gin 
 Every time you see me I'm in my sin 
 So what's the use of getting sober 
 When you gonna get drunk again 
 DV: 
 I went out last night about half past one 
 Thought I'd whoop it up a little and have some fun 
 I got me a half pint about half past two 
 Mmm, mmm, the way I was feeling, you know what I wanna do 
 Got me a pint about half past four 
 Felt so good, went out and got me some more 
 Got me a quart about half past five 
 Boy, that was so nice, didn't know if I was dead or alive 
 So what's the use of getting sober 
 If you gonna get drunk again 
 Oh, Sam done something fine 
 When he bought that good whiskey, beer, and wine 
 I love my whiskey and I love my gin 
 Every time you see me I'm in my sin 
 So what's the use of getting sober 
 When you gonna get drunk again 
 Well I've been thinking 
 And I keep drinking 
 I guess I'm 'bout to lose my mindHere we stand 
 Remote control buttons in our sweaty little hands 
 As one man 
 We're lining up and waiting for someone's command 
 We don't move 
 We send out for food, get the news on video 
 I can prove 
 There's no need for movies, we got HBO in the 
 TV Age 
 (They're out there somewhere) 
 You know the force has got a lot of power 
 But what makes you think it gives a shit about you? 
 Who are you anyway? 
 (They're taking over) 
 I believe the aliens have to take a physical form on our planet 
 So why not one with thirteen channels? 
 (They're out there somewhere) 
 Times must change 
 This ain't the Stone Age, we don't have rocks in our heads 
 What's so strange 
 We don't work no more, so why get out of bed? 
 TV rules 
 Pretty soon you won't be able to turn it off at all 
 All you fools 
 Then it'll turn you off, your back's against the wall in the 
 TV AgeEverybody's wasting time 
 Everybody stands in line 
 Think of Babe Ruth and you think of hot dogs and beer 
 But if he could hit a home run so can you 
 And your weight is just nowhere near 
 Am I making myself quite clear? 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 If that's the best you can do 
 Get out of my place 
 Take anyone's face 
 Come last in the race but 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 The clock is ticking on the wall 
 Everybody has to take a fall 
 Think of Ray Charles and you think of sunglasses at night 
 But if he can play piano so can you 
 And you can tell black from white 
 Can you tell me that I'm not right? 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 If that's the best you can do 
 Get out of my life 
 Be anyone's wife 
 And do what you like but 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 Think of Babe Ruth and you think of hot dogs and beer 
 But if he could hit a home run so can you 
 And your weight is just nowhere near 
 Am I making myself quite clear? 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it 
 If that's the best you can do 
 Get out of your shell 
 Be anyone's pal 
 Do bad or do well but 
 Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for itI'm hitting fast forward 
 Seems like we've gotten kind of stuck 
 Time to get out of town and try to 
 Set the controls for sometime off in the future 
 When people will be happy instead of 
 Getting dumber and getting scareder all the time 
 Scared of their own shadows and scared to take a fall 
 Either miserable with millions or dying for a dime 
 Desperate to live forever or lucky to live at all 
 And if I could see myself from some other planet 
 Would I be shaking my head sadly or 
 Would I be laughing 
 Saying, it's always been the same 
 But anyway 
 Not going back to the Age of Gold or the Age of Sin 
 Fast forward till I understand the age I'm in 
 And it's always the old guys bitching 
 About the young guys growing beards 
 Or turning into sissies or something 
 While they're trying to hold back time 
 As if that isn't weird 
 Meanwhile the young guys are 
 Waiting for respect when what they wanna be is cool 
 Cool, calm, and collected just as if that isn't strange 
 Or they wanna blow the whistle, ring the bell and change the rules 
 When the game goes on forever 
 It's just the uniforms that change 
 If this is the best of times or if it's the worst 
 There's some difference of opinion out there 
 Everyone is a genius 
 But no one has any friends 
 Or is it the other way around 
 Not going back to the Age of Gold or the Age of Sin 
 Fast forward till I understand the age I'm in 
 Sometimes I look at the Moon 
 And I think I know just how she feels 
 Going 'round and 'round us again 
 As we go 'round the Sun 
 Watching us as fools 
 And geniuses rush in 
 And you and me age disgracefully 
 And have way too much fun 
 And everyone knows about what's over and done 
 And tied up with pretty ribbons on it 
 One king after another 
 With a mad one and a queen or two 
 Thrown in for good measure and meanwhile 
 We can make the future, make it every bit as clear 
 Make a friendly Star Trek universe, 'cause everything's allowed 
 The only place that's seriously strange to be is here 
 And the only time that's maddeningly mysterious is now 
 So I'm hitting fast forward 
 Come on, come on, get on board 
 You don't wanna be late now 
 Not going back to the Age of Gold or the Age of Sin 
 Fast forward till I understand the age I'm inUptown, downtown 
 No one's fussy, I'm a target 
 Black, white, day, night 
 No one's fussy, I'm a target 
 Somebody say I'm crazy 
 Walking in this neighbourhood 
 Say you can't be too careful 
 But that won't do no good 
 I'm no one special 
 But any part of town 
 Someone could smile at me then 
 Shake my hand then gun me down 
 Uptown, downtown 
 No one's fussy, I'm a target 
 Black, white, day, night 
 No one's fussy, I'm a target 
 Somebody say I'm crazy 
 Living in this crazy town 
 I say maybe you're just lazy 
 Got to either swim or drown 
 I know what I'm doing 
 I'm happy day to day 
 But then something happens 
 Takes my nerve away 
 Uptown, downtown 
 No one's fussy, I'm a target 
 Black, white, day, night 
 No one's fussy, I'm a targetIt's Christmas time again 
 Has it really been a year 
 And a soldier sighs again 
 And thinks about his kids and English beer 
 Pulls on his boots again 
 And steps into the pissing rain 
 And the clouds look just like dirty sheep 
 But at least he's got a job 
 And he knows he can't complain 
 And you may think that this song comes too late 
 But lest we forget 
 This tango Atlantico isn't over yet 
 Can you imagine this 
 The general and the lady dance 
 She flashes victory signs and smokes cigars 
 He shines his medals up for one last chance 
 They make a pretty pair 
 But no one understands their game 
 Because they can't agree about the stakes 
 They can't agree on anything 
 They can't even agree on the name 
 And you may think that this song comes too late 
 But lest we forget 
 This tango Atlantico isn't over yet 
 Sorry Tommy 
 Lost a foot? 
 Bloody land mines 
 No more soccer for you 
 And you may think that this song comes too late 
 But lest we forget 
 This tango Atlantico isn't over yetMy friend Jonny loved a lady 
 Who was as bad as women can be 
 The lady's name was Lily 
 And Jonny loved her just as much as me 
 Then one night Jonny lost his head 
 He found her naked in a sailor's bed 
 Jonny cried, oh no 
 Lily sighed, please go 
 But he pulled a gun instead 
 The gun, it made a bang 
 And all the angels sang 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye Lily, goodbye Lily 
 We could have had it all 
 But it never lasts forever 
 And now we've nothing at all 
 Goodbye Lily, goodbye Lily 
 Life can be so cruel 
 I'll keep going, just keep going 
 Just another poor fool 
 And though my heart may break in two 
 A hundred years from now 
 These things will all be forgotten 
 Goodbye Lily, goodbye Lily 
 We were more than friends 
 Someday maybe, in heaven maybe 
 Or the other place 
 I may see your face 
 And be happy again 
 My friend Jonny was a rover 
 He was a gypsy who never had a home 
 But now his journey's over 
 And flowers grow on top of his bones 
 Into battle we both were led 
 With Jonny carrying our flag ahead 
 And though the day was dark 
 A bomber found his mark 
 Just another young man's head 
 The bomb, it made a boom 
 Which spelled poor Jonny's doom 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye Jonny, goodbye Jonny 
 We could have had it all 
 But it never lasts forever 
 And now we've nothing at all 
 Goodbye Jonny, goodbye Jonny 
 Life can be so cruel 
 I'll keep going, just keep going 
 Just another poor fool 
 And though my heart may break in two 
 A hundred years from now 
 These things will all be forgotten 
 Goodbye Jonny, goodbye Jonny 
 We were more than friends 
 Someday maybe, in heaven maybe 
 Or the other place 
 I may see your face 
 And be happy againMemphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 I gotta get away, study my geography 
 I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be 
 I used to see the light, now it's all a mystery 
 I used to feel the beat, now I feel a million miles from 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 I used dirty words never too excessively 
 But saying "rock 'n 'roll" never seemed so bad to me 
 I once said it in hip and happy company 
 I was in and out in a second on my way to 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 So where the hell is Memphis? 
 I had a one-way ticket and a little radio 
 I turned it on, heard a song from twenty years ago 
 Somebody smiled and said that's the only way to go 
 He died at twenty-one, now nobody's innocent in 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Somebody turned around, said I got to disagree 
 He wrote a song to turn people out to anarchy 
 He made them think about Marlon Brando on TV 
 I guess they still rebel against anything they got in 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 I met a wise old man, he had longer hair than me 
 He said Memphis is nothing like it used to be 
 A hundred dead guitars lying in the cemetry 
 I felt a sudden chill, now I'm not so sure about 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis? 
 I'm on a lonesome train on a lonesome track 
 I think I'll jump right off, head for home, double back 
 And though I'm better now, I know that no one knows the facts 
 I'm gonna start again, forget I ever heard about 
 Memphis 
 Where the hell is Memphis?Trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 A hungry man 
 Can hold out a long time 
 For some soul food 
 Good food, whole food 
 I know I was that man 
 Maybe sometimes hold out a little too long 
 I took a right 
 Then I took a wrong turn 
 Someone asked me for a quarter 
 It didn't seem to fit 
 He didn't look much like a Chinaman 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 An old black man 
 Pushed a shopping trolley 
 Filled with tin cans 
 Avoided his glance 
 I'm nervous and I'm lost 
 And I don't see too many restaurants 
 A guy laid out 
 With a knife in his back 
 A cop came along 
 Told him, move on 
 Go home and sleep it off 
 I didn't know if I should get involved 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown 
 I was trying to find Chinatown 
 Trying to find Chinatown...Out to the west there's a trail that leads somewhere 
 And a call of the wild that takes some people there 
 Through Monument Valley to California sun 
 From New Amsterdam to the Way the West Was Won 
 Well, years will go by when you won't get nowhere 
 You're cold and you're tired and you're free and you don't care 
 You keep pushin' on when your friends keep turning back 
 And you keep building towns and laying railroad track 
 And things get crazy and you have to use that gun 
 And you wonder if this is the way the west is won 
 But keep thinkin' that way and you won't get nowhere 
 'Cause you got a right just to get where you're goin' to 
 Gotta keep runnin' gotta be the best 
 Gotta walk tall in the wild west 
 You keep on the move or you try to settle down 
 And there's strangers from further and further away any town 
 And you give them some tools and they know what must be done 
 And you know who's the boss and you know the west was won 
 They say 
 Where I come from you can't get nowhere 
 I'm breaking my back for some opportunity 
 Making my fortune and I'll take it all home 
 Tell my kids about the wild west 
 But there's still beauty as the flowers bloom on desert sands 
 And there's still hope as the sun rises over the Rio Grande 
 But it's so crowded now and nothing's simple any more 
 And they're still knocking at your door 
 You hear guns in the night and you hope they're not for you 
 'Cause a dog eats a dog, then he eats his master, too 
 In the land of the free and the not so often brave 
 There's both love or money, now choose which you will save 
 But keep thinkin' that way and you won't get nowhere 
 'Cause you got a right just to get where you're goin' to 
 Gotta keep runnin' gotta be the best 
 Gotta walk tall in the wild west 
 Keep thinkin' that way and you won't get nowhere 
 'Cause you got a right just to get where you're goin' to 
 Gotta keep runnin' gotta be the best 
 Gotta walk tall in the wild 
 Gotta walk tall in the wild 
 Gotta walk tall in the wild westThere's a guy going round the town 
 You got to check what he is puttin' down 
 Just one look you know the story is great 
 He's the guy the chicks love 
 And the cats can't hate 
 He's a shape in a drape 
 A shape in a drape 
 He's a shape in a drape 
 And you can dig that he is stookin' 
 Now some say he's a clipster and a tailor's toad 
 And he could hype a miserman for all his gold 
 Some say he's a hipster and some say nix 
 But everyone's solid when he gets his kicks 
 He's a shape in a drape 
 A shape in a drape 
 He's a shape in a drape 
 And he is sure alive and kickin'Perdido 
 I look for my heart, it's perdido 
 I lost it way down in Torido 
 The day the fiesta started 
 Bolero 
 I swayed as they played a bolero 
 I kissed 'neath a listening sombrero 
 And that's when my heart departed 
 High was the sun when I held him close 
 Low was the moon when we said "adios" 
 Perdido 
 My heart ever since is perdido 
 I know I must go to Torido 
 To find what I lost perdido 
 High was the sun when I held him close 
 Low was the moon when we said "adios" 
 Perdido 
 Good luck, perdido 
 I lost perdidoI know you think that I protest too much 
 I'm like a diva with the tragic touch 
 But if I wanna hide from the pouring sun 
 It has to be all right 
 And I can have my pride, but I'll turn and run 
 When a fool would stand and fight 
 And if I try, hard enough 
 To do or die, and push and shove 
 I know that I would be too tough 
 Too tough to fall in love 
 With you 
 You've really gotten underneath my skin 
 Must have been easy, it was always thin 
 So if I wanna cry in the burning rain 
 Don't worry, I'll survive 
 But even when you're high, I can feel your pain 
 That's what I call being alive 
 So if I fall, I'll get back up 
 And there'll be tears, and blood and stuff 
 Still I stand tall, but not too tough 
 Too tough to fall in love 
 With you 
 With you 
 And I can see your point of view 
 But I can't see a way to be tough too 
 Tough too 
 You know I hate it when you talk this way 
 'Cause you don't listen to a word you say 
 And it took a lot of time to grow your shell 
 Maybe enough's enough 
 And I could tell you why you should go to hell 
 But I don't want to be that tough 
 So if I try, hard enough 
 To do or die, and push and shove 
 I know that I would be too tough 
 Too tough to fall in love 
 With you 
 With you 
 With youYou ain't been blue, no, no, no 
 You ain't been blue 
 Till you've had that mood indigo 
 That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes 
 While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues" 
 Always get that mood indigo 
 Since my baby said goodbye 
 In the evenin' when lights are low 
 I'm so lonesome I could cry 
 'Cause there's nobody who cares about me 
 I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be 
 When I get that mood indigo 
 I could lay me down and dieYou come to me in the blue time 
 Between the night and the day 
 Always too soon for the sunrise 
 Always too late for a second chance 
 Between an old and a new time 
 Reaching out as you slip away 
 Into the dream that I'm losing 
 While I awaken into a trance 
 As it starts to rain 
 And blue turns indigo 
 We part again in the blue time 
 Bruising our hearts on the way 
 A dream fading back to the darkness 
 Leaving the echo of one last danceWhat do you want, blood? 
 Kids today 
 They're all the same 
 All call themselves 
 Some crazy name 
 Monks and rockers and Beatle freaks 
 Punks and skunks and kooks and geeks 
 You're looking in a mirror but you can't see your face 
 Looking in a mirror but you can't see your face 
 All those drugs 
 They can't be sane 
 All that noise 
 Affects their brains 
 Sniffin' pot, smoking glue 
 Whatever terrible things they do 
 Smokin' LSD and such 
 It must be the reason why they can't talk much 
 And it's such a crime 
 How they waste their time 
 They can't get nowhere 
 They've all gone 
 Beat crazy 
 Beat crazy 
 They say the world 
 Is in a mess 
 But they can't talk 
 The way they dress 
 See the knee through the hole in their jeans 
 A hole in their pocket and it looks so mean 
 Hole in the T-Shirt, what's that you said? 
 You're about as clever as a hole in the head 
 Can't get no jobs 
 Can't get careers 
 With safety pins 
 Stuck through their ears 
 Cut your hair, dye it green 
 See it shine, with Brylcreem 
 A little dab'll do ya, a little dab a day 
 Or rub-a-dub it in a dreadlocks way 
 And it's such a crime 
 How they waste their time 
 They can't get nowhere 
 They've all gone 
 Beat crazy 
 Beat crazy 
 And if the Russians ever come 
 They'll all be beating bongo drums 
 Damn, beatniks rule 
 Dropped out of kindergarten 
 Dropped out of school 
 Really hot on my bongo drums 
 Really hot on my bongo drums 
 So who'll defend 
 In World War III 
 Where could we turn 
 Where would they be 
 Tell her! 
 Down in the cellar, filled with smoke 
 Laughing at the latest joke 
 Doing the latest dance to do 
 The Fug and the Shimmy and the Suzie Q 
 And it's such a crime 
 How they waste their time 
 They can't get nowhere 
 They've all gone 
 Beat crazy 
 Beat crazy 
 Looking in a mirror but you can't see your face 
 Beat crazy 
 Beat crazy 
 Beat crazyThere goes another one 
 Another happy couple on the road to emptiness 
 I think of my father and mother 
 Can they imagine how two people can get in this mess 
 But the old songs say love's forever 
 And the old songs never say die 
 But a song can't keep us together 
 How can that beautiful song be a lie? 
 Me, I blame the old songs 
 Filling hearts with rebellion and romance 
 Our book of revelations 
 And all we had to do was dance 
 Play us another one 
 Play us the hopes and dreams of twenty years ago 
 They're all over the bloody radio 
 It's like they're telling us there's nowhere left to go 
 And the old songs say "be my baby" 
 And the old songs say "she loves you" 
 All the songs we'll sing come what may be 
 I like those songs 
 But I'd like something new 
 Me, I blame the old songs 
 Protect us all against a change of course 
 All our great expectations 
 Turn to alimony and remorseCome on, you people, get your dancing shoes on 
 Reds and yellows and pinks and blues on 
 Too late, too late 
 To stay home and sit around 
 Purple leopard skin and see-through plastic 
 Whatever you want but just make it drastic 
 Too late, too late 
 To stay home and sit around 
 What you wanna bet 
 We ain't started yet 
 Baby stick around 
 Baby stick around 
 Pushin' and shovin' and sweat wet leather 
 Up and down we go chained together 
 Too late, too late 
 To stay home and sit around 
 Somebody tellin' me the latest scandals 
 Somebody steppin' on my plastic sandals 
 Too late, too late 
 To stay home and sit around 
 What you wanna bet 
 We ain't started yet 
 Baby stick around 
 Baby stick around 
 Too late, too late 
 To stay home and sit around 
 What you wanna bet 
 We ain't started yet 
 Baby stick around 
 Baby stick aroundHere's a young one 
 Hey Rufus, how's the rain on the rhubarb 
 You wanna go out with me 
 Yeah, I know we're out 
 It's, like, a figure of speech 
 All you need is a real girl guide 
 Give it up and come inside 
 Slip the leash, shake it loose 
 Bite the peach, suck the juice 
 What did you call me (Angel...) 
 What was that again (Angel...) 
 Ave gloriosa virginum regina 
 Vitis generosa, vite medicina 
 Clemencie resina 
 Ave copiosa gracie piscina 
 Carnis maculosa mund' illum sentina 
 Mundicie cortina 
 Hey chicken, is that your girl 
 Bet she lays like a lump 
 What's your poison - lemonade 
 Velveteen or a razor blade 
 You wanna walk in the dark with me 
 To a place where no one sees 
 Kiss the glove, pretty please 
 You wanna pray 
 On your knees 
 What did you call me (Angel...) 
 Say it again (Angel...) 
 Claritate radiosa, stella matutina 
 Brevitate legis glossa 
 Perte lex divina 
 Irradiat doctrina 
 Venustate vernans rosa 
 Sine culpa spina 
 Caritate viscerosa, aurem huc inclina 
 Serves ill'a ruina 
 Hey sailor 
 How's the steam in the stovepipeCan't drink the water 
 Can't breathe the air 
 Can't hide down in the sewer 
 'Cause there's crocodiles down there 
 My hovel needs a barricade 
 My pants need an alarm 
 Need some non-alcoholic whiskey 
 And some Giuliani charm 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya... 
 Don't look at me on the subway 
 And I won't look at you 
 Don't touch me with your greasy gloves 
 And syphilitic flu 
 Brain cancer causes cell phones 
 Brain damage causes drugs 
 I'm staying off the streets 'cause 
 Gang war causes thugs 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya 
 Just because you're paranoid 
 Don't mean they're not out to get ya...Take a knife 
 Cut out this heart of ice 
 Hold it high 
 Walk into the sun 
 Take a knife 
 Cut out this heart of ice 
 Hold it high 
 Walk into the sun 
 Take a knife 
 Cut out this heart of ice 
 Hold it high 
 Walk into the sunHello one and all 
 Was it you I used to know 
 Can't you hear me call 
 On this old ham radio 
 All I got to say 
 Is I'm alive and feeling fine 
 Should you come my way 
 You can share my poison wine 
 No marigolds in the promised land 
 There's a hole in the ground 
 Where they used to grow 
 Anybody left on the Rio Grande 
 Is the king of the world 
 As far as I know 
 I won't take your bread 
 I don't need no helping hand 
 I can't be no savage 
 I can't be no highwayman 
 Show me where you are 
 You and I can spend this day 
 Driving in my car 
 Through the ruins of Santa Fe 
 No marigolds in the promised land 
 There's a hole in the ground 
 Where they used to grow 
 Anybody left on the Rio Grande 
 Is the king of the world 
 As far as I know 
 I'm reading last year's papers 
 Although I don't know why 
 Assassins cons and rapers 
 Might as well die 
 When you come around 
 No more pain and no regrets 
 Watch the sun go brown 
 Smoking cobalt cigarettes 
 There's no need to hide 
 Taking things the easy way 
 If I stay inside 
 I might live till Saturday 
 No marigolds in the promised land 
 There's a hole in the ground 
 Where they used to grow 
 Anybody left on the Rio Grande 
 Is the king of the world 
 As far as I knowLooking over Hong Kong Harbour 
 Throw a shrimp in yellow wine 
 Eat it when it ceases moving 
 Just before is fine too 
 There's an ancient Chinese saying 
 Always seems to slip my mind 
 Does it really die with honour 
 Does it really matter 
 It's a big world 
 It's a big world, so much to see 
 Sitting on a beach in Bali 
 Tried to reach and grab a cloud 
 Looked so much like cotton candy 
 And I'm feeling godlike 
 Could it be just what I'm eating 
 Only mushrooms after all 
 And with juice of avocado 
 I should live forever 
 It's a big world 
 It's a big world, so much to do 
 Sitting on the floor in Kyoto 
 Marvel at the latest catch 
 Eat it as soon as you are able 
 Quick before they cook it 
 There's an eyeball staring at me 
 And I know I've met my match 
 Do I eat or am I eaten 
 It's a new adventure 
 It's a big world, so much to do 
 It's a big world, so much to see 
 From the Leningradsky Prospekt 
 On the road to Mandalay 
 There's a new intoxication 
 Hits you just as you're leaving 
 Café sur Les Champs-Elysées 
 Baklava in Istanbul 
 Smoke a pipe in Casablanca 
 Question all you believe in 
 It's a big world, so much to see 
 It's a big world, so much to do 
 And plenty of room for me and youHello, I'm back again 
 Haven't seen you since I don't know when 
 It's been so long, but you seem so cold 
 Is it something you've been told 
 She said, so this is what you think of me 
 Going with some whore somewhere out in Germany 
 I said, baby, baby, can't you see 
 It's nothing to do with you and me 
 Nothing to do with my heart 
 Nothing to do with my head 
 Nothing to do with our home 
 Nothing to do with our bed 
 It's just b-i-o-l-o-g-y 
 Can't you see 
 It's just biology 
 Biology coming in between you and me 
 Your biology lesson starts here 
 And first of all we should make it clear 
 That the species known as males 
 Have these little white things with little white tails 
 Which multiply and start to shout 
 It's getting crowded down here, let us out 
 Once relieved, they start again 
 It's not a process controlled by the brain 
 It’s nothing to do with their hearts 
 Nothing to do with their heads 
 Nothing to do with their homes 
 Nothing to do with their beds 
 It's just b-i-o-l-o-g-y 
 Can't you see 
 It's just biology 
 Biology coming in between you and me 
 She said, thanks, I'm so relieved 
 What your saying I can well believe 
 Now I know, I feel no shame 
 About Dave and Tony and Phil and James 
 I said, baby, baby, this can't be true 
 She said, well what's right for you 
 Has to be right for me 
 In any case I'm sure you'll see 
 It's nothing to do with our hearts 
 Nothing to do with our heads 
 Nothing to do with our homes 
 Nothing to do with our beds 
 It's just b-i-o-l-o-g-y 
 Can't you see 
 It's just biology 
 Biology coming in between you and meI've had that dream again 
 Where I'm flying thirty feet 
 Above the street again 
 Looking though windows, there you are 
 Sit down to eat again 
 It's the usual egg foo yung 
 You watch TV again 
 Put the kids to bed 
 And then I see you reaching for my number 
 Then I hate you even more 
 I see it all 
 But no one sees me fly 
 No one feels my pain 
 No one hears me cry 
 No one knows my name 
 Is glamour and pain, glamour and pain 
 Do you remember me 
 Or just the shiny shiny shoes I had you kiss for me? 
 And my legs as smooth as chrome 
 Were you in ecstasy 
 As you were pumping out a flood of dollar bills for me 
 I'd cry mascara tears 
 If only I could give a fuck about it 
 And though you can't recall 
 I see it all 
 But no one sees me fly 
 No one feels my pain 
 No one hears me cry 
 No one knows my name 
 Is glamour and pain, glamour and pain 
 I'm hanging in the air 
 I look in your window at my own lipstick reflection there 
 And behind it such a precious son et lumière 
 Of all the normal stuff about which I'm supposed to care 
 I'd like to smash right through 
 And help myself to your silverware 
 To cut your throat and run 
 Or maybe I'd just laugh at your expression 
 Hooray for Superwhore 
 I see it all 
 But no one sees me fly 
 No one feels my pain 
 No one hears me cry 
 No one knows my name 
 Is glamour and pain, glamour and pain 
 See me fly, feel my pain 
 Hear me cry, know my name 
 Glamour and painTake what you want 
 But just what you need 
 For survival 
 Take what you want 
 But just what you need 
 For survival 
 Survival 
 Life's a bitch and then you die 
 Nothing you can do about it 
 Anything you steal or buy 
 You're gonna be leaving here without it 
 So take what you want 
 But just what you need 
 For survival 
 Survival 
 Take what you want 
 But just what you need 
 For survival 
 Survival 
 Take what you want 
 But just what you need 
 For survival 
 Survival 
 SurvivalLet it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it pour 
 We'll have one for the road, put a bolt on the door 
 Let it rain cats and dogs, let it rain rats and snakes 
 But just bring us more grog and another rare steak 
 Let it rain, let it hail, let it rain frogs and toads 
 But just bring us some ale, we'll have ten for the road 
 Let it blow, let it roar, let it rain bats from hell 
 Wipe their arses and pluck 'em, we'll eat them as well 
 Did you here about Clyde who ate ribs till he died 
 At a sign that said "all you can eat for ten bob" 
 When the doctors were done pumping out his insides 
 He went back the next morning to finish the job 
 Let the skies turn to black, let it rain kangaroos 
 But just give us tobacco and tucker and booze 
 So who cares about heaven or burning beneath 
 When we're all busy digging our graves with our teeth 
 Did you hear about Matt who fell into a vat 
 Well they say that he drowned but it took him a week 
 And they say that it wasn't as strange as all that 
 When you think that he kept getting out for a leak 
 Let it rain, let it flood, let 'em load up the ark 
 Bring us buckets of blood while they sink in the dark 
 Give 'em two vegetarians and two of the poor 
 And two of the tossers who say less is moreBoys - whatcha gonna say down there? 
 Oh, boys - whatcha gonna say down there? 
 Palomar, Shalimar, Swanee Shore 
 Let me dig that jive once more 
 Boys - take it right on down to the gator 
 Oh, boys - gotta take a side elevator 
 Can't you hear those hepcats call 
 Come on, boys, let's have a ball 
 The jip-jam-jump is a jumpin' jive 
 Makes you dig your jive on the mellow side 
 Hep hep 
 Hep hep 
 The jip-jam-jump is a solid jive 
 Makes you nine foot tall when you're four foot five 
 Hep hep 
 Hep hep 
 Now, don't you be that ickeroo 
 Get hep, come on and follow do 
 When you get your steady fool 
 You met your jump like the gators do 
 The jip-jam-jump is a jumpin' jive 
 Makes you like your eggs on the Jersey side 
 Hep hep 
 Hep hep 
 The jip-jam-jumpin' jive 
 Makes you hep hep on the mellow side 
 The jip-jam-jump is a jumpin' jive 
 Makes you nine foot tall when you're four foot five 
 The jip-jam-jumpin' jive 
 Makes you dig your jive on the mellow side 
 Now don't you be that ickeroo 
 Get hep, come on and follow do 
 When you get your steady fool 
 You met your jump like the gators do 
 The jip-jam-jump is a jumpin' jive 
 Makes you like your eggs on the Jersey side 
 Hep hep

 The jip-jam-jumpin' jive 
 Makes you hip hip on the mellow side 
 Skiddley boo, skiddley diddley diddley... 
 Now I told you 'bout the jumpin' jive 
 Jip-jam-jump the jumpin' jive 
 I know you dug this mellow jive 
 'Cause you dig it on the mellow sideDon't let her down 
 Just 'cause you could before 
 She stole the crown 
 You don't rule anymore 
 Oh no - take it like she did before 
 Oh no - take it like a man 
 Strong sexy smart 
 Slim sassy super-cool 
 She gets the parts 
 You get to play the fool 
 Mean drunk or dumb 
 We're not casting boys today 
 Braveheart or bum 
 Who needs you anyway 
 Oh no - take it like she did before 
 Oh no - take it like a man 
 Don't feel so down 
 You'll find some job to do 
 Gangsta or clown 
 She'll keep a place for you 
 You feel her touch 
 Fingers like icicles 
 She needs you so much 
 Like fish need bicycles 
 Oh no - take it like she did before 
 Oh no - take it like a man 
 Don't be a woman, take it like a man 
 Don't be a woman, take it like a man 
 Don't be a woman, take it like a man 
 Don't be a woman, take it like a manNow that you're gone, nothing is wrong 
 But everything's changed 
 Words in your hand, do I set them in stone 
 Or throw them away 
 Now everything we did 
 Like photographs that always moved 
 And that wasn't strange 
 Now they're in the can 
 Let's put them on the shelf 
 Let's put them underground 
 They'll never move again 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after 
 Ever after 
 Over and done, all of the fun 
 And all of the pain 
 Why don't I laugh, why don't I cry 
 It ends up the same 
 Now that you're gone, everything's wrong 
 Though nothing has changed 
 And everything we said 
 Is there on the tape for the future to play 
 Let's put her in the ground 
 That's where it ought to stay 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after, ever after 
 Ever after 
 Ever after 
 And it'll be all right 
 And it'll be all right 
 It'll be 
 Ever after, ever after...I'm gonna rant and rave 
 I'm gonna lose control if they get me mad 
 I'm staring at the TV screen 
 They're staring right back 
 I got a bottle in my hand 
 I think I'll blow them up 
 I'm gonna weep and wail 
 I'm gonna gnash my teeth at the lies they tell 
 And half the people in the world 
 Don't even know where they are 
 Don't even know they're being had 
 I'm gonna wake them up 
 Believe me, you'll find out that everything's rotten 
 From bottom to top through and through 
 All gold is just glitter 
 All gains are ill-gotten 
 But now what the hell do we do 
 I'm gonna scream and shout 
 I'm gonna stamp my feet till a policeman comes 
 I don't care what they say 
 Don't care what they write down 
 Book of Rules or Book of Life 
 I'm gonna tear them up 
 Now who wants to be just a bug that they trample 
 You see what has happened, of course 
 'Cause instead of using the force of example 
 Now it's just the example of forceDamn! 
 Fuck this bull shit spit flat beer back 
 Rock star dumb luck sick joke clap trap 
 Damn thin shoe lace yank spit jerk snap 
 Bomb kike scam bank tear down dead flag 
 I got a right to bite the hand 
 That feeds the greed that pays the band 
 I got a right to fight the man 
 That takes the cake that feeds the clan 
 I don't like the way you look at me 
 You don't like what I do in bed 
 Maybe I should get some deputies 
 And come and break your fucking head 
 Oh, no no 
 That won't do at all 
 Ignorance is a kind of bliss 
 A smack in the mouth is a kind of a kiss 
 Methinks I doth protest too much 
 And no matter what the people say 
 I'm gonna have to get in touch 
 With my inner adult some day 
 La la la la la la di dah 
 Suck this dick head fuck that light crap 
 Kiss kiss puke hate rack suit riff raff 
 Bash slut mash butt beat that spic brat 
 Stab dyke snap neck kill punk scum bags 
 I got a right to light the flame 
 That fries the guys that take the blame 
 I got a right to bite the hand 
 That feeds the greed that pays the bandIt's the crack of noon 
 And I sit here watching you sleeping 
 I only wish that I could remember your name 
 But I know it's written on a matchbook somewhere 
 So maybe I'll find it, and maybe you'll care 
 Or maybe you'll fix me with one of those stares 
 And put up a fight 
 So when you awake I admit I'm relieved 
 As you flash me a smile like a diamond 
 And just for a moment I almost believe 
 In love at first light 
 I propose a breakfast of coffee and aspirin 
 You laugh, suggesting a raw egg or two 
 But oh was it ever so good being bad 
 Like a couple of vampires, deliciously mad 
 Saying this is the best blood that we've ever had 
 So we drank it all night 
 And if we untangle the webs that we weave 
 Then maybe there's room for more laughter 
 'Cause just for a moment I almost believe 
 In love at first light 
 Feeling cold 
 You put a robe 'round my shoulders 
 Smile and pull one of your favourite books from my shelf 
 Let's open the curtains and let out the dark 
 And if the sun doesn't melt us and there's still a spark 
 And we do something human like walk in the park 
 The spark could ignite 
 So maybe I'm moonstruck or maybe naive 
 But I know there's a God and a Devil 
 So maybe I'm crazy enough to believe 
 In love at first lightWe always were the kind of people 
 To take it hard when things would go wrong 
 Little things would bother me 
 And little things would make you cry 
 And after all the confrontations 
 When it comes time for saying goodbye 
 All that I can wonder 
 Is what do I do with these flowers 
 And what do I do with my evenings 
 And what do you do with that ring 
 I'm gonna go now 
 No, you can't hold me 
 Not with such a sentimental thing 
 So tell me why I'm feeling nothing 
 And tell me how you can't even cry 
 Little things are logical 
 But if there's a god above then 
 Can it be that love was 
 Just another sentimental thing 
 So tell me why I'm feeling nothing 
 And tell me how you can't even cry 
 Little things are logical 
 But if there's a god above then 
 Can it be that love was 
 Just another sentimental thingFeelin' low 
 Rockin' slow 
 I want to go 
 Right back where I belong 
 Way down south in Birmingham 
 I mean south in Alabam' 
 An old place where people go 
 To dance the night away 
 They all drive or walk for miles 
 To get jive, that southern style 
 An old jive that makes you want 
 To dance till break of day 
 It's a junction 
 Where the town folks meet 
 At each function 
 In a tux they greet you 
 Come on down, forget your care 
 Come on down, you'll find me there 
 So long town, I'm heading for 
 Tuxedo Junction now 
 Feelin' low 
 Rockin' slow 
 I want to go 
 Right back where I belong 
 Way down south in Birmingham 
 I mean south in Alabam' 
 There's an old place where people go 
 To dance the night away 
 They all drive or walk for miles 
 To get jive, that southern style 
 An old jive that makes you want 
 To dance till break of day 
 It's a junction 
 Where the town folks meet 
 At each function 
 In a tux they greet you 
 Come on down, forget your care 
 Come on down, you'll find me there 
 So long town, I'm heading for 
 Tuxedo Junction now 
 Tuxedo Junction nowDon't laugh, but there are people in this world 
 Born as boys, and fighting to be girls 
 People standing in their way 
 Some are straight and some are gay 
 Calling them the drag queens 
 Say you can't be one of us 
 You only have yourself to blame 
 You don't fit 
 Don't laugh, but there are people in this town 
 Be polite, say a whiter shade of brown 
 People that they gotta fight 
 Some are black and some are white 
 Calling them the half-breeds 
 Say you can't be one of us 
 You only have yourself to blame 
 You don't fit 
 That's what you're there for 
 Square pegs in square holes 
 Round pegs in round 
 You get too big then 
 They can't make new holes 
 So they'll cut you down 
 All ugly sisters 
 Must wear glass slippers 
 Or get out of town 
 But don't cry if the people in your street 
 Lead a life that's more or less complete 
 Little problems every day 
 Little problems go away 
 Kid yourself you're fighting for life 
 Kid yourself you fight for love 
 But maybe in some other lifetime 
 You won't fit 
 And if you don't fit 
 You're fit for nothing at all 
 If you don't fit 
 You’re fit for nothing at all 
 Nothing at all...Hey you 
 I'm dancin' with your girl 
 Her head is in a whirl 
 She don't know who to turn to 
 All right

 But she could soon be mine 
 And I could soon be hers too 
 One night

 He sits there drinkin' gin and 
 She sits there drinkin' beer like me 
 He's timing every move but 
 She's only killing time like me 
 And of course 
 What will be will have to be 
 But I tread carefully 
 It could be a case of 
 Right place right time 
 Hey you 
 I'm dancin' with your girl 
 Her head is in a whirl 
 She don't know who to turn to 
 All right 
 I'll leave her just this time

 I'm gonna make her

 People line up to get in 
 To wait for the end 
 Living in glorious sin 
 They've looked around 
 And now there is no looking back 
 To when rivers ran red 
 Now it's the sky that grows black 
 Shadows are cast 
 As two giants roam over the earth 
 We light a match 
 But what is that little flame worth 
 Once allies danced and sang 
 But it was forty years ago 
 Here in D.C. 
 They talk about 'Euro-disease' 
 And how the French 
 Are always so damn hard to please 
 Motions are passed 
 In Brussels but no one agrees 
 And no one walks tall 
 But no one gets down on their knees 
 Once allies laughed and drank 
 But it was forty years ago 
 Where I come from 
 They don't like Americans much 
 Think they're so loud 
 So tasteless and so out of touch 
 Stiff upper lips 
 Are curled into permanent sneers 
 Self-satisfied 
 Awaiting the next forty years 
 Once allies cried and cheered 
 But it was forty years agoWake up this mornin' and the paper's on the mat 
 Poor getting poorer and the rich are getting fat again 
 Up in the towers all the bosses sitting sneezing 
 A half asleep and the rest all start to squeezing tight 
 Don't worry 'bout it baby 
 Don't try to understand 
 You got your answer in your hand 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away 
 Wake up this morning there's a letter on the mat 
 Big Brother wanna know where little brother's at again 
 Life is a piece of paper, goes on forever 
 Sign on the dotted line or end up in the river drowned 
 Don't worry 'bout it baby 
 Don't try to understand 
 You got the answer in your hand 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away 
 Wake up this morning there's a letter on the mat 
 Big Brother wanna know where little brother's at again 
 Life is a piece of paper, goes on forever 
 Sign on the dotted line 
 Or end up in the river drowned 
 Drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned 
 Drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned 
 Don't worry 'bout it baby 
 Don't try to understand 
 You got the answer in your hand 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it away, throw it away 
 Throw it awayNow 
 The mist across the window hides the lines 
 But nothing hides the colour of the lights that shine 
 Electricity so fine 
 Look and dry your eyes 
 We 
 So tired of all the darkness in our lives 
 With no more angry words to say can come alive 
 Get into a car and drive 
 To the other side 
 Me babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 You babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 We 
 Are young but getting old before our time 
 We'll leave the TV and the radio behind 
 Don't you wonder what we'll find 
 Steppin' out tonight 
 You 
 Can dress in pink and blue just like a child 
 And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile 
 We'll be there in just a while 
 If you follow me 
 Me babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 You babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 Me babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 You babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the light 
 Me babe, steppin' out 
 Into the night 
 Into the lightI got ideas but I don't know it all 
 And when I speak you know my voice is small 
 And when I'm walking down the street 
 I never smile at folks I meet 
 'Cause I know they won't smile at me 
 Now ask yourself why this should be 
 But if you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 If you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 Don't ask me 
 I got feelings but they don't count for much 
 And I shake my fist but I got no power as such 
 But if I tell you what I see 
 Don't throw my words right back at me 
 'Cause I can't shout and I can't moan 
 'Cause I got problems of my own 
 And if you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 If you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 Don't ask me 
 Someday soon I gotta learn enough 
 To justify my actions 
 Until then I want you all to try 
 To share my gut reactions 
 Gut reactions 
 If you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 If you want the answers 
 If you want the answers 
 Don't ask me 
 Don't ask me 
 Don't ask me 
 Don't ask meCall me cool as January 
 I walk like the breeze 
 And wear the world like filigree 
 Call me too large for life 
 That's only sticks and stones 
 I'm standing so tall 
 It seems that I've grown 
 Call me irresponsible 
 Your rules of the game 
 Are only clouds to float above 
 Call me, let's do lunch 
 When I get time for girls 
 I'm working on things 
 To astonish the world 
 Call me weird and laugh at me 
 I tell you it's true 
 I've found a cure for gravity 
 Call me mad as March 
 High as in Hogmanay 
 Just watch me and weep 
 I'm out of this maze 
 See the wings made of feathers 
 Of wax and of thread 
 See me soar high above 
 All the quick and the dead 
 Call me now 
 Call me Stars and Moon and Plough 
 Call me Lord, call me Sire 
 Call me Earth and Wind and Fire 
 Call me Judge, call me Shah 
 Call me King, call me Tsar 
 Call me GodI'm okay, you're okay 
 Why remember when it wasn't this way 
 See my home, see my car 
 And the beach always used to seem so far 
 And no one touches me 
 Unless it's the way I want it to be 
 I know, I read the right magazines 
 I'm cosmopolitan 
 And I don't look back 
 I'm all right, sleep at night 
 Used to lie awake listening to cats fight 
 See my hair, see my shoes 
 And I used to be scared of the dark, too 
 And no one touches me 
 Unless it's the way I want it to be 
 I know, I read the right magazines 
 I'm cosmopolitan 
 And I don't look back 
 Cosmopolitan 
 And no one touches me 
 Unless it's the way I want it to be 
 I know, I read the right magazines 
 I'm cosmopolitan 
 And I don't look backShe says that he's pouring fuel on the fire 
 He turns around and calls her a liar 
 She says I'm trying to get to a higher plane 
 Someone around here's sane 
 God only knows if it's you or me 
 He says that she's jealous just like a female 
 She says I caught you, I went through your e-mail 
 He says it's getting hard just to be male now 
 Somebody tell me how 
 God only knows why we're enemies 
 Hey, why doesn't someone say 
 This dull black and white should fall away 
 Please, tell me it's not just me 
 Can't wait until we're all bright grey 
 Bright grey 
 She packs her baggage and goes home to mother 
 He says go on 'cause he's sick of being smothered 
 She says I'm saving revenge for another day 
 How did it get this way 
 God only knows how it used to be 
 Hey, why doesn't someone say 
 This dull black and white should fall away 
 Please, tell me it's not just me 
 Can't wait until we're all bright grey 
 Bright grey 
 Bright grey 
 Hey, why doesn't someone say 
 This dull black and white should fall away 
 Please, tell me it's not just me 
 Can't wait until we're all bright grey 
 Hey, why doesn't someone say 
 This dull black and white should fall away 
 Please, tell me it's not just me 
 Can't wait until we're all bright grey 
 Bright greyEx-friends, ex-lovers, and enemies 
 I got your cases in front of me today 
 All sewn up 
 Ex-bosses, you never let me be 
 I got your names and your numbers filed away 
 I've grown up 
 See me 
 Hear me 
 Don't you know you can't get near me 
 You can only hope to hear me 
 On your radio, on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 Radio, on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 Ex-teachers still coming through to me 
 Tough kids don't stop trying to kick me to the ground 
 I don't care 
 Go on just do what you do to me 
 You look so sick when you're pushing me around 
 You're nowhere 
 See me 
 Hear me 
 Don't you know you can't get near me 
 You can only hope to hear me 
 On your radio, on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 Radio, on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio

 Radio, oh.. 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 You're gonna hear me on your radio 
 And you can't turn onMaybe it would be better 
 If we never said goodbye 
 Maybe I'd grow much older 
 With you in my life 
 Maybe we'd come out winners 
 Putting the world to rights 
 Maybe I should be sorry 
 For wasting your time 
 So who's right 
 Who'll take my side 
 And call it spite or call it pride 
 Call it love that never died 
 Call it anything but wasted time 
 After the party's over 
 After the dream has died 
 Some people keep returning 
 To the scene of the crime 
 Try to rewrite the story 
 Tell you you never tried 
 Tell you you should be sorry 
 For wasting their time 
 So who's right 
 Who'll take my side 
 And call it spite or call it pride 
 Call it love that never died 
 Call it anything but wasted time 
 Maybe we could have done better 
 Maybe, maybe not 
 Maybe we could have made better use of time 
 Maybe if anyone knew better how much time we've got 
 It wouldn't be so hard 
 To make the words all rhyme 
 So who's right 
 Who'll take my side 
 And call it spite or call it pride 
 Call it love that never died 
 Call it anything but wasted timeTell me one more time as I hold your hand that you don't love me 
 Tell me one more time as teardrops start to fall 
 Shout it to me and I'll shout it to the skies above me 
 That there was nothing after all 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never wanted my loving 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 Tell me one more time we never had a thing in common 
 Tell me one more time as you turn and face the wall 
 Tell me I should know you never were my kind of woman 
 And tell me we were fools to fall 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never wanted my loving 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 Tell me one more time your tears are only sad confusion 
 And tell me it's just been so long and that is all 
 Tell me one more time that love was only my illusion 
 You never answered to my call 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never wanted my loving 
 Baby, baby 
 Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 One more time, one more time 
 Say you're leaving, say goodbye 
 One more timeI'm sinking in 
 To a sea of secrets warm and green 
 Down and down 
 Back to times and places never seen 
 Now and then 
 I can wake and I remember 
 Just one secret thing 
 Through the rain 
 I can keep a candle burning 
 Under the skin of the world 
 It's sinking in 
 No need for fear of drowning, drift away 
 These monsters here 
 Are only faces I don't wear by day 
 Now and then 
 I can wake and in the mirror 
 Demons turn to friends 
 Through the pain 
 I can dig a little deeper 
 Under the skin of the worldKing Pleasure is on a mission 
 To take the power from the Pope and politicians 
 He's come to party and he shows it 
 He rules the world but not everybody knows it 
 It's King Pleasure Time 
 So show respect, get on your knees 
 You can't reject his right to please 
 King Pleasure is gonna get you 
 He don't give a damn about who wants to let you 
 They try to nag him, they try to scold him 
 They build cages but no one can ever hold him 
 He knows your secret, he's got your number 
 He'll stop you working but he'll stop you getting dumber 
 You wanna hold him, you wanna kiss him 
 You can deny it but it's futile to resist him 
 It's King Pleasure Time 
 So show respect, get on your knees 
 You can't reject his right to please 
 King Pleasure will live forever 
 You can't control him, though you think you're pretty clever 
 And after every computer crashes 
 He'll be laughing as he's dancing on your ashes 
 In King Pleasure Time 
 So show respect, get on your knees 
 You can't reject his right to pleaseJamie G., I want you 
 Even though I know that I can't have you 
 Even though 
 I don't know which way you go 
 I'm dying to come with you 
 What kind of times are these 
 A guy can't do what he pleases 
 But the way that you tease 
 I'd risk all diseases 
 Jamie G., I want you 
 Even though I know that I can't have you 
 Even though 
 I don't know which way you go 
 I'm dying to come with you 
 C'mon let's drink champagne 
 Before they bring back Prohibition 
 Smoke a pack or two 
 Then try another position 
 Jamie G., I want you 
 Even though I know that I can't have you 
 Even though 
 I don't know which way you go 
 I'm dying to come with youYou know I'm just a small town girl 
 I'm off to see the whole wide world 
 I'm off to see the wizard, too 
 Do everything that Dorothy won't do 
 I know I should have stayed at home tonight 
 There's nothing happening but something might 
 It's like a whirlpool and I get sucked in 
 Go 'round and 'round and back where I began 
 This town is my town, my town 
 I'm through with their town 
 This town is my town, my town 
 This town's a fairground 
 One-two-three go! 
 One-two-three go! 
 I like the candy floss and all the rides 
 And feeling inside out in my insides 
 I guess I'm fucking nearly everyone 
 Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever come 
 This town is my town, my town 
 I'm through with their town 
 This town is my town, my town 
 This town's a fairground 
 One-two-three go! 
 One-two-three go! 
 One-two-three go! 
 One-two-three go!Is there anybody going to listen to my story 
 All about the girl who came to stay 
 She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry 
 Still you don't regret a single day 
 Ah girl, girl 
 When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her 
 She would turn to me and start to cry 
 And she promises the earth to me and I believe her 
 After all this time I don't know why 
 Ah girl, girl 
 She's the kind of girl who puts you down 
 When friends are there, you feel a fool 
 When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood 
 She's cool 
 Ah girl, girl 
 Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure 
 Did she understand it when they said 
 That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure 
 Will she still believe it when he's dead 
 Ah girl, girl 
 Girl, girlStop - what's that sound? 
 It's the death rattle of this rusty old town 
 Stop - listen again 
 It's the sound of laughter all along the Thames 
 Hey - what's my line? 
 Do I have to stay here till the end of time? 
 I'm - good-lookin' and bright 
 I wanna see life after ten at night 
 So if they ask you where I am 
 I'm in the back of a Transit Van 
 In a squat on the Earls Court Road 
 Gone down to London, changing coal into gold 
 Down to London, down to London 
 Gone down to London to be the king 
 Gone down to London to be the king 
 Hey - what's your name? 
 The boys back home all seem to look the same 
 You - should stick with me 
 And one of us will make it, just you see 
 Stop - what's that sound? 
 Seems like the sixties are still swingin' around 
 Hey - can you hear me back there? 
 Or is there anybody left to care? 
 And if you ask me where they are 
 They're hangin' tough in a Soho bar 
 Playing guitars on the Underground 
 Gone down to London, tryin' to chase that sound 
 Down to London, down to London 
 Gone down to London to be the king 
 Gone down to London to be the king 
 So I ask you, should I cry or laugh 
 Drinking tea in a Kings Cross Caff 
 A leather jacket against the cold 
 Gone down to London, changing coal into gold 
 Down to London, down to London 
 Gone down to London to be the king 
 Gone down to London to be the kingOutside in and inside out, you're my meat 
 Fat and forty but lordy you're my meat 
 From your feet to your head you knock me dead, you're my meat 
 I got you covered but baby, you're my meat 
 In the days of old when knights were bold 
 They were pious and modest I'm told 
 Can't you see that couldn't be me 
 I'd have to talk about your yams and your big fat hams 
 It excites me so because I know you're my meat 
 Fat and forty but lordy you're my meat 
 In the days of old when knights were bold 
 They were pious and modest I'm told 
 Can't you see that couldn't be me 
 I'd have to talk about your yams and your big fat hams 
 It excites me so because I know you're my meat 
 Fat and forty but lordy you're my meat 
 Fat and forty but lordy lordy 
 You're my meatOh, the romance of these harbour towns 
 Lights that shimmer on canals 
 And in the bottom of your glass 
 The air buzzing with foreign tongues 
 And the occasional cries 
 Of sailors, tramps, and rock 'n' rollers 
 Hey babe, you look so hot tonight 
 Hey, hey, come on over here, I'll treat you right 'cause 
 A man's a man all right 
 Just like any other man 
 He'll search the town tonight 
 For a fifty dollar love affair 
 Ah, another taste of cheap delight 
 Street food sizzling outside 
 Washed down with the local poison 
 These back alleys with their pinkish lights 
 And the occasional cries 
 Of smugglers, bums, and credit card holders 
 Hey babe, I feel so good tonight 
 I got shore leave and I sure ain't leavin' here till I prove that 
 A man's a man all right 
 Just like any other man 
 He'll search the town tonight 
 For a fifty dollar love affairYou come into my life 
 And then you go away 
 You make me feel a fool 
 For wanting you to stay 
 But I'm a busy guy 
 A lot of things to do 
 But there's a reason why 
 Some of them just seem to lose their flavor 
 I feel like death warmed up 
 I can't taste the coffee in my cup 
 I feel so low I'm underground 
 Every time you're not around 
 And if I didn't feel so high 
 And if I didn't feel so proud 
 Then I wouldn't cry 
 I wouldn't feel so down 
 When you're not around 
 When you're not around 
 You come and fill me up 
 With ecstasy and pain 
 And then I run on empty 
 Till I see you again 
 But I've got things to do 
 And places I can go 
 I guess I can't blame you 
 If some of them just seem to feel like nowhere 
 No, I don't feel so great 
 I can't taste the sandwich on my plate 
 I try to sing but there's no sound 
 Every time you're not around 
 And if I didn't feel so high 
 And if I didn't feel so proud 
 Then I wouldn't cry 
 I wouldn't feel so down 
 When you're not around 
 When you're not around 
 And if I didn't feel so high 
 And if I didn't feel so proud 
 Then I wouldn't cry 
 I wouldn't feel so down 
 When you're not around 
 When you're not aroundJohnny was a young boy 
 With nothing much except a certain kind of look in his eye 
 He was discovered one day 
 You see he had a certain kind of appeal 
 For a certain kind of guy 
 Who gave him some advice on what to wear 
 And sent him out to make the young girls cry 
 And all the young boys who'd been just dumb and restless 
 Now they could identify 
 So tell me who'll take the blame 
 For the way things turned out 
 Well six long months passed 
 And Johnny was the biggest thing alive 
 And we loved Johnny and we owned Johnny 
 But no one knew how Johnny felt inside 
 Johnny was so beautiful, he was like a god 
 And we all went along for the ride 
 And the ride started to go too fast 
 And Johnny just conveniently died 
 And he went up in flames 
 He did what he had to do 
 And they say it's a tragic story 
 He just wasn't there one day 
 But he went out in a blaze of glory 
 And you and I, you and I just fade away 
 Well nowadays there's a lot of guys like Johnny 
 They got it all worked out, like working 9 to 5 
 But they're all just cartoons, they all think they're Superman 
 But they can't even fly 
 And they say that Johnny's ghost walks 'round in Memphis 
 When the moon is full and high 
 And I wonder if he's seen these jokers 
 And I wonder if he laughs or if he cries 
 Now he's an angel in flames 
 But what about you and me 
 Well they say it's a tragic story 
 He just wasn't there one day 
 But he went out in a blaze of glory 
 And you and I, you and I just fade away 
 Well they say it's a tragic story 
 He just wasn't there one day 
 But he went out in a blaze of glory 
 And you and I, you and I just fade away 
 You and I just fade away 
 You and I just fade away 
 Just fade awayWith just a little smile 
 We'll straighten it out 
 Yeah, even a fight like this 
 You gotta start somewhere 
 And not with a kiss 
 Maybe a little word 
 Following on 
 From another word or two 
 Put them together 
 Soon we can break on through 
 Someone else might come with another plan 
 Someone else could be twice as smart 
 I'll put one foot in front of the other 
 No other way I can make a start 
 With just a little joke 
 We're getting somewhere 
 Even on a night like this 
 It doesn't have to be funny 
 These things are hit and miss 
 But just a little smile 
 Is better than that 
 Better than a pot of gold 
 You can't ask for more than 
 Something that won't grow old 
 Someone else might come with another plan 
 Someone else could be twice as smart 
 I'll put one foot in front of the other 
 No other way I can make a start 
 Someone else might come with another plan 
 Someone else could be twice as smart 
 I'll put one foot in front of the other 
 No other way I can make a start 
 Someone else might come with another plan 
 Someone else could be twice as smart 
 I'll put one foot in front of the other 
 No other way I can make a startDear Mom, I thought I found my sister 
 Downtown, less than a week ago 
 I called in, and some guy said I just missed her 
 She moved on, where do you think she'd go? 
 Dear Mom, I know she's only sixteen 
 She's tough, but these days you never know 
 Someone saw her at the El Mocambo 
 He said she put on quite a show 
 What if she won't come home 
 You know she don't want your money 
 What if she won't come home 
 Dear Mom, I saw her on the subway 
 She looks good, she got a new tattoo 
 She swears she's gonna call me later 
 I'd say there's nothing we can do 
 What if she won't come home 
 You know she don't want your money 
 What if she won't come home 
 Dear Mom, I heard from my little sister 
 Guess what, she's really doing well 
 She told me to give you a message for her 
 "Dear Mom, why don't you go to hell" 
 Now that she won't come home 
 Maybe I'll stick around here 
 Now that she won't come home 
 Now that she won't come home 
 Maybe I'll stay forever 
 Now that she won't come homeIf you want to 
 Live forever 
 Ask a doctor 
 Someone clever 
 He can put you on 
 Or get you off 
 Of the drug du jour 
 All you kings and martyrs 
 All the little girls and boys 
 Will thank you when you start us 
 Safely on the way to be citizen sane 
 If you want to 
 Make your mind up 
 Ask a preacher 
 Where you'll wind up 
 He can take you in 
 Or shut you out 
 Of the final door 
 All you kings and martyrs 
 All the little girls and boys 
 Will thank you when you start us 
 Safely on the way to be citizen sane 
 Hooray to be citizen sane in a world gone mad 
 Please, may we just switch all our brains 
 On to good from bad 
 All we want's the word 
 And we want it now 
 No way do we want any pain or to feel too sad 
 If you want to 
 Join a mission 
 Ask the leader 
 For permission 
 He can put you down 
 Or pick you up 
 Off the killing floor 
 All you kings and martyrs 
 All the little girls and boys 
 Will thank you when you start us 
 Safely on the way to be citizen saneI don't know why they come here 
 I'm only glad they do 
 They're gonna pay the bills for me and you 
 People out for an evening 
 They have a real good time 
 But when I play I feel just like I'm miming 
 I made a stand for the music 
 To turn the page with ease 
 I got the smile that says I'm here to please 
 Me and the bass guitarist 
 Have even shined our shoes 
 The drummer's shoes are dirty to confuse 
 I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days 
 I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell 
 The waiters wore black dinner jackets and all that kind of thing 
 And the band wore blue shirts 
 And the music played on 
 Then at the end of the evening 
 They throw the suckers out 
 Don't get me wrong, I got no beef about it 
 I get my rates from the union 
 I get my shirts real cheap 
 I get my money, get home, get some sleep 
 I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days 
 I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell 
 The waiters wore black dinner jackets and all that kind of thing 
 And the band wore blue shirts 
 And the music played on 
 I guess someday my kids will ask me 'bout the old days 
 I guess that I'll tell them there ain't much to tell

 Laundromat MondayIt was on a summer night, she says 
 A year ago today 
 Packed, the place was packed 
 The chicos lookin' for some play 
 He wore a satin shirt 
 And said a prayer to Yemayá 
 And he was calm and handsome 
 As they squeezed through to the bar 
 The girls were in tight dresses 
 Just like sweets in cellophane 
 Everyone was there 
 Sabrosón from Spanish Harlem 
 And Luz from Camagüey 
 In her hand a single rose 
 In her mouth a razor blade 
 Hot, the place was hot 
 Too many people to be safe 
 She says 
 It was our night 
 Watch us seize the day 
 And dance it all away 
 Bailamos, esa noche, bailamos 
 In Happyland 
 It was on a summer night, she says 
 It was a year ago 
 Hot, the place was hot 
 But where else were they gonna go 
 And then they heard the screams 
 And saw the smoke come down 
 And then it really turned into 
 The hottest club in town 
 She remembers all the fire trucks 
 That maldito TV crew 
 And he, he didn't make it 
 So, "Mi amor, this song's for you" 
 She's got red shoes on her feet 
 And a red smile on her face 
 And people say she's loca 
 To go back into that place 
 She says 
 This is my night 
 Watch me seize the day 
 And dance it all away 
 Bailaré, esta noche, bailaré 
 In Happyland 
 Bailaré, esta noche, bailaré 
 In Happyland 
 Happyland 
 HappylandMusic has charms, they say 
 But in some people's hands 
 It becomes a savage beast 
 Can't they control it 
 Why don't they hold it back 
 You see, my friend and me 
 Don't have an easy day 
 And at night we dance, not fight 
 And we need the energy 
 If not the sympathy 
 But I'm brutalized by bass 
 And terrorized by treble 
 I'm open to change my mood but 
 I always get caught in the middle 
 And I get tired of DJs 
 Why is it always what he plays 
 I'm gonna push right through 
 I'm gonna tell him to 
 Tell him to 
 Play us 
 Play us a slow song 
 Play us a slow song 
 It's late, I'm winding down 
 Am I the only one 
 To want a strong and silent sound 
 To pick me up and undress me 
 Lay me down and caress me 
 I feel you touch my hand 
 And whisper in my ear 
 Ask me how I'm feeling now 
 And I want to get near you 
 But I can't even hear you 
 But this is a fine romance 
 If we have to be so demanding 
 We need just one more dance to 
 Leave here with an understanding 
 And I get tired of DJs 
 Why's it always what he plays 
 I'm gonna push right through 
 I'm gonna tell him to 
 Tell him to 
 Play us 
 Play us a slow song 
 Play us a slow song 
 And I get tired of DJs 
 Why's it always what he plays 
 I'm gonna push right through 
 I'm gonna tell him to 
 Tell him to 
 Play us, play us 
 Play us a 
 Play us, play us, play us 
 Play us a slow song 
 Play us a slow song 
 Play us a slow song 
 Play us a slow songI stepped out in the pouring rain 
 To find a place where they feel my pain 
 Gonna cry where they can't complain 
 Gonna howl like a hurricane 
 You don't like me 
 You don't need me 
 You won't see me 
 On the other side of town in the neon rain 
 Got a head like an egg that is gonna crack 
 Gonna go straight to hell and I won't come back 
 Gonna head down the track on a mystery train 
 Got the drug gonna drive me sane 
 Gonna fly like an aeroplane 
 When my mind can't take the strain 
 Crack my head and eat my brain 
 You don't like me 
 You don't need me 
 You won't see me 
 On the other side of town in the neon rainI remember lying wide awake at night 
 Had to have you at my side to make it right 
 You were my high and low 
 You taught me to fly 
 And I would always be your satellite 
 I remember floating free of appetite 
 Hanging high upon a breeze just like a kite 
 You were my pride and joy 
 And my suicide 
 And I would always be your satellite 
 You keep on spinning till you start to slow 
 Gravity is gonna get you someday 
 Like a swimmer in the undertow 
 When the water's gonna take you under 
 I remember giving in without a fight 
 Just so you could be my sin and my delight 
 You were my girl and boy 
 You were the world 
 And I would always be your satellite 
 You keep on spinning till you start to slow 
 Gravity is gonna get you someday 
 Like a swimmer in the undertow 
 When the water's gonna take you underI'm not a happy guy 
 But I'm not always sad 
 And I'm no millionaire 
 But I don't do so bad 
 But no matter who you think you are 
 There's always someone with a different view 
 There's always someone thinks he's got a right 
 To say what's good for you 
 So how do you know 
 That the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't know 
 Anyway 
 I'm not a clever guy 
 But I'm sure not that dumb 
 Don't have the inside news 
 But I know what goes on 
 And if you put your faith in God above 
 Or if you watch the skies for Superman 
 There's always times when you can see the answers 
 Slip right through their hands 
 So how do you know 
 That the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't know 
 Anyway 
 So no matter who they think they are 
 As they tell you who to fight or how to dance 
 Why don't you give yourself a break 
 And give us all a chance 
 'Cause how do you know 
 That the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't know 
 Anyway 
 How do you know 
 That the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't know 
 How do you know 
 That the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't know 
 How do you know 
 When the man in the street don't care 
 And why don't you care 
 When the man in the street don't knowSome say the world is spinning faster 
 Some say it isn't fast enough 
 Some people say they've got the answer 
 And some are scared to say they can't keep up 
 I read the paper but it still isn't clear 
 The bombs are falling but I'm still here 
 I know all the figures and I know all the facts 
 But all I can do is keep trying 
 To look for the human touch 
 To look for the human touch 
 Life is hard when you've got nothing 
 Life can be hard when you've got too much 
 Sometimes I wonder what's the difference 
 It's only better with someone to touch 
 I got the telephone stuck to my ear 
 I keep yelling but you don't hear 
 In all the universe I'm just a speck of dust 
 But all I can do is keep trying 
 To give you the human touch 
 To give you the human touch 
 You know we're nothing in the scheme of things 
 Just microchips in big machines 
 And the world is spinning 'round and 'round 
 But I know that we can slow it down 
 And I know that I can make you see 
 I'm on the side of you and me 
 And all I want to do 
 Listen to me 
 Is give you, give you, give you 
 Give you the human touch 
 Give you the human touch 
 To give you the human touch 
 To give you the human touchIn distant lands 
 There's no such luxury 
 You'd give your hand 
 In pre-arranged matrimony 
 You'd wear the veil 
 I'd sit in some cafe somewhere 
 Instead of this running around 
 And this right to be free 
 So pleased with ourselves but there's one thing 
 I've found about you and me is 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apart 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apart 
 In all my dreams 
 I've wanted someone like you 
 With no extremes 
 We'd both do what we have to do 
 But it's too easy and then it's too hard 
 And passion gives us away 
 We know when to play the right cards 
 But we never know what to say 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apart 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apart 
 Why can't you be just more like me 
 Or me like you 
 And why can't one and one 
 Just add up to two 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apart 
 We can't live together 
 But we can't stay apartWe were brought up in a boring town 
 Watching our feet sink into the ground 
 Never went up on a roof at night, oh no 
 On top of the city 
 To look at the lights 
 Remember the TV was on all day 
 With so much silence to chase away 
 Now we sit up on the roof at night, you know 
 And listen to sirens 
 And neighbours who fight 
 We're the A Team, the White Knights 
 And we want it all 
 We got the big dream 
 And the bright lights 
 But we don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 We don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 We were brought up with the smell of grass 
 Knowing that nobody had no class 
 Sitting on top of a tower of steel, now I know 
 That nobody's perfect 
 And everything's real 
 We're the A Team, the White Knights 
 And we want it all 
 We got the big dream 
 And the bright lights 
 But we don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 We don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 Come with me up on the roof tonight, you know 
 We'll be kings of the city 
 And look at the lights 
 'Cause we're the A Team, the White Knights 
 And we want it all 
 We got the big dream 
 And the bright lights 
 But we don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 We don't see the stars anymore 
 We don't see the stars 
 We don't see the stars 
 We don't see the starsHey, can you hear me now 
 As I fade away 
 And lose my ground 
 Maybe you'd like to know 
 What I'd have to say 
 If I was still around 
 Now I'm made of smoke 
 You see through me 
 It's the strangest joke 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Why did the lights go down 
 Or onto someone new 
 Well let them learn 
 I used to own this town 
 Now I'm watching you 
 Now it's my turn 
 Now I'm made of mist 
 Will you know 
 When you've been kissed 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Now I'm almost free 
 Disappearing 
 Don't cry for me 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Can't stop the invisible man 
 Can't touch the invisible manTurn off the TV and turn off the light 
 Turn off the street lamps as well 
 Turn off the billboards that scream through the night 
 And dream the policemen to hell 
 Close all the windows and close all the doors 
 Close all the shutters and blinds 
 Close down the churches and pray to the whores 
 Lay down and then close your eyes 
 It's amazing what comes into view 
 As we're finally breaking the chains 
 When the temperature rises 
 We'll go to our place in the rain 
 Take down the pictures and take out the trash 
 Take up the tattered old rugs 
 Take up the mattress and count all the cash 
 And laugh with the last of the drugs 
 Burn all the papers and burn all the wood 
 Burn what we can't understand 
 Run up a flag for the old neighbourhood 
 Sit back and then take my hand 
 It's amazing what lovers can do 
 With just a kiss and a glass of champagne 
 When the rivers run dry 
 We can go to our place in the rain 
 Pay off the piper and pay all the bills 
 Pay for the getaway car 
 Blow out the candles and head for the hills 
 Pray that we make it that far 
 Run from the poison and run from the flames 
 Run from the maddening crowd 
 Laugh at the whispers of who'll take the blame 
 And sing all the sinners out loud 
 It's amazing what crazy can do 
 When every good citizen's sane 
 When heaven's a desert 
 We'll go to our place in the rain 
 It's amazing what comes into view 
 When you just connect your heart back to your brain 
 When heaven's a desert 
 We'll go to our place in the rainGive me a Bud and a slice 
 And leave me alone 
 If I want your advice, I'll ask ya 
 They tell me caviar's nice, but I wouldn't know 
 So what's it to you 
 Who needs your airs 
 And your microbrew 
 Look at the sun 
 See how it hangs so still in the sky 
 Give me the new TV Guide 
 And get off the phone 
 Go on and take sides, it's not my problem 
 Waiting for worlds to collide in the comfort of home 
 They say Lucifer's free 
 What shall we do 
 Don't ask me 
 But it's not like I never go beyond these walls 
 I've got culture 
 I go to the movies 
 Last week, saw the new Tarantino 
 Starring, shit, what's that guy's name again? 
 You know the scene where they 
 Put the blowtorch to his balls 
 Bloody brilliant 
 My daughter threw up, she didn't understand 
 I told her it's just like the Beano 
 It's not real 
 And if it was, well, so what 
 Come on, lighten up 
 Let's all lighten up 
 Give me a Bud and a slice 
 And leave out the book 
 I've got one of those, thank you 
 As for the guru you prize, he might be a crook 
 And L.A.'s so hot 
 Still, I might go 
 Or 
 Might 
 Not 
 Look at the sun 
 See how it hangs so still in the skyPlease, mister, can you help me try to find my baby's house 
 It's three in the morning in the pouring rain 
 I can't find the house and I forgot the number 
 But I gotta give her these roses to relieve her pain 
 Don't laugh, just tell me you've been there before 
 So we fight but we fight every evening 
 And I tell you, every morning I just love her more 
 And life goes on, filled with disasters and friction 
 And life can be strange 
 But love can be stranger than fiction 
 Only love can be stranger than fiction 
 Excuse me, operator, tell me what time it is 
 Me and my lover been in bed all day 
 I think I strained a muscle 
 I didn't know I had 
 And tell me what day it is anyway 
 Don't laugh, just tell me you hear what I say 
 I love her so much I don't even know what planet I'm on 
 Love her so much I wish she'd just go away 
 And life goes on, filled with bizarre contradictions 
 And life can be strange 
 But love can be stranger than fiction 
 Only love can be stranger than fiction 
 I know that sometimes love goes 
 But sometimes it comes back to getcha 
 And when love grows 
 It grows like a flower or grows like a tumor 
 Love shows that God has a sense of humor 
 Life goes on, ever immune to prediction 
 And life can be strange 
 But love can be stranger than fiction 
 Only love can be stranger than fiction 
 Stranger than fiction, stranger than fiction 
 Stranger than fictionThugz-r-us, thugz-r-us

 Yeah, and can you imagine how many we can't even see? 
 Imagine we're in the middle of the galaxy 
 Yeah, imagine how many blazing stars there'd be 
 They're gonna build a ship to take us there 
 Soon 
 If you can wait a year or two you'll see 
 We're gonna fly in tomorrow's world 
 And there'll be cities on the moon 
 No one'll die in tomorrow's world 
 And miracles will happen soon 
 In tomorrow's world 
 Hey, do you remember that rocket they blasted into God knows where? 
 Yeah, with the pictures for someone to find 
 With chemical symbols saying Hi how you doin' to the folks out there 
 Yeah, they put the Bach music in, left all the shit behind 
 Sometimes I think we should be sending out an SOS 
 But mostly I just think of all the things that I can't wait to see 
 We're gonna live in tomorrow's world 
 We'll live on power from the sun 
 We're gonna give in tomorrow's world 
 And there'll be food for everyone 
 In tomorrow's world 
 We're gonna fly in tomorrow's world 
 And there'll be cities on the moon 
 No one'll die in tomorrow's world 
 And miracles will happen soon 
 In tomorrow's world 
 Tomorrow's world 
 Tomorrow's world 
 Tomorrow's worldYou might have seen me hanging around 
 I never miss one night 
 I could be on the town 
 I used to be another one like you 
 Always running home 
 To that special one or two 
 And when I think of all the years 
 Of finding out what I already knew 
 Now I spread myself around 
 And you can have three minutes, too 
 'Cause I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 Looking out for number one 
 I got a line or two that never fail 
 And every time you look around 
 I'll be there on your tail 
 I'm nothing special but I don't give in 
 Before you know it I'll be there 
 Right underneath your skin 
 And if you think that being serious and smart 
 Gets you where you should be 
 You must be not only joking 
 But way too heavy for me 
 'Cause I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 I'm a hit single 
 Going straight to number one 
 And when I die and go to pure pop heaven 
 The angels will gather around 
 And ask me for my whole life story 
 And ask for that fabulous sound 
 But I know they're gonna stop me 
 As I start going through every line 
 And say, please not the whole damn album 
 Nobody has that much time 
 Please, just the hit single 
 Just the hit single 
 Just the hit single 
 Just the hit single 
 Gotta love that number one 
 One, one, oneWell, I wear this leather jacket just to try and beat the cold 
 Well, I know it's not the thing but then it's all of two years old 
 Though I never was a punk, I'm sure you'll understand 
 But a sixty-five pound leather you just cannot throw away 
 So I'll wear it just from A to B but not on Saturdays 
 At the meeting of the cult, I'll be a different man 
 Out of style 
 That's what I hear them saying inside my head 
 Oh yes, it looks real cool but is it out of style this week? 
 All the world's so full of problems I just don't know what to do 
 Should my jacket have three buttons? Am I out of style with two? 
 Is my hair too long? 'Cause I think I feel a change 
 I guess I should be ready for it, I look younger than my age 
 And I think there's something stirring in the corner of the page 
 Of the NME, and I let them lead the way 
 Out of style 
 That's what I hear them saying inside my head 
 Oh yes, it looks real cool but is it out of style this week? 
 Out of style 
 That's what I hear them saying - inside my head 
 Oh yes, it looks real cool but is it out of style this week?The guy who lives upstairs 
 Is an actor, so they say, or maybe worse 
 They say he changed his name 
 'Cause someone with the same name made it first 
 His girlfriend comes to stay 
 We hear her screams and think that they rehearse 
 So maybe it's a play 
 Or maybe someone's really getting hurt 
 Look 'round every home town 
 Every nice house, every fair deal 
 Every good job, every square meal 
 In every dream home 
 A nightmare 
 The girl who lives next door 
 Is a model, so they say, though I'm not sure 
 She never seems to work 
 The clothes she wears suggest that she's not poor 
 She seems to be well-known 
 With man friends always coming to her door 
 But they don't look her type 
 And she don't look the type to be a whore 
 Look 'round every home town 
 Every nice house, every fair deal 
 Every good job, every square meal 
 In every dream home 
 A nightmare 
 Every dream home 
 A nightmare 
 Every dream home 
 A nightmareThe older I get the more stupid I feel 
 I don't know what's going on 
 Tired of trying to be strong 
 When I should be crying 
 The further I go the less distance I see 
 Leave behind another home 
 The harder I try the less people I please 
 The older I get the more lucid I feel 
 Let it go and let it come 
 Tired of trying to belong 
 When I could be flyingDown there in the ashes there's gold and silver, too 
 Dear sister, I try to share with you 
 Smug, you said, take your spoils away 
 And you broke the bridge on your side 
 You wither my troubles and all I dream to do 
 With half-smiles until I scream at you 
 Mad, you said, that's how you repay 
 But you broke the bridge on your side 
 And where am I as I swallow your tears 
 Amaranth with a slipper appears 
 Do you hack at your heel? 
 Do I try not to feel? 
 I fail with my anger and with my sympathy 
 I tremble, so little left for me 
 Harsh, you said, now you walk away 
 But I left the gold for you to find 
 When you broke the bridge on your sideHere darkness never quite descends 
 Only the toughest stars 
 Hang with neon friends 
 Over neon candy stores 
 Till the bitter end 
 Oh, madness 
 Waits for me someday 
 Raising a champagne glass 
 Down some dark alleyway 
 Down some mean magnetic street 
 Stopping me to say 
 You could live anywhere you want to 
 Give me one reason to stay 
 Here monsters walk the earth again 
 Mermaids in black and gold 
 Perfume and cocaine 
 Rising from a teeming sea 
 Asking me again 
 You could have anyone you want to 
 Give me one reason to stay 
 I think I'll stay
