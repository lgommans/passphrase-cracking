 Here I am different in this normal world 
 Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset? 
 Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads 
 I am ugly, please just go away 
 (HIV) 
 I can see it's hard to find 
 This blessing in disguise 
 (HIV) 
 Why do you treat me this way? 
 Made the hate stay 
 As I walk I can never seem to escape 
 All the laughing, all the pain 
 If you were me, what would you do? 
 Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away 
 I can see it's hard to find

 To all the people that think I'm strange 
 That I should be out of here, locked up in a cage 
 You don't know what the hell is up now anyway 
 You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved 
 To a world that never appreciated shit 
 You can suck my dick and fuckin' like it

 Yip-yip-yip-yip-ya-eeeee!We are the ones taking all the pain, falling on our faces 
 They don't care anyway, anyway, now 
 You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive 
 You're the one that pushes me all the time, all the time, now 
 We are hard and grey, always praised to do what they say 
 Calling me deranged, feeling power, I must take its place some way 
 Never gonna run away, seeking out the path, but the pain always gets in the way 
 Slowly watch me die 
 I'm insane, so dangerous, don't you dare get in my way 
 Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way 
 Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 We are the ones reaching out in vain, trying to solve our problems 
 They won't go away, go away now 
 You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive 
 You're the one that pushes me all the time, all the time, now 
 We are hard and grey, always praised to do what they say 
 Calling me deranged, feeling power, I must take its place some way 
 Never gonna run away, seeking out my path, but the pain always gets in the way 
 Slowly watch me die 
 I'm insane, so dangerous, don't you dare get in my way 
 Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way 
 Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Never gonna run away, seeking out my path, but the pain always gets in the way 
 Slowly watch me die 
 I'm insane, so dangerous, don't you dare get in my way 
 Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way 
 Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Pounding all these spikes in my veins 
 Looking at my thoughts, I take my time, pounding all these spikes in my veinsAlways it's coming, and here starts the game 
 Why can't this puzzle be solved? 
 Each time it happens it's always the same, I look down and it starts to fall 
 And all I see, it burns my eyes, burning all inside 
 Caught in the corners of my mind, beginning over one more time 
 Taking me over, taking all that's mine one more time 
 Always this teasing, sometimes I lose faith 
 Where is my strength to hold on? 
 Facing existence, how can I relate? 
 Do I stand still or move on? 
 And all I see, it burns my eyes, burning all inside 
 Caught in the corners of my mind, beginning over one more time 
 Taking me over, taking all that's mine, one more time 
 Falling through this space and time, buried in this hurt of mine 
 Falling slowly like a dream, falling through a world unseen 
 Why can I not break this spell? 
 I'm in darkness, is this Hell? 
 Falling towards this hole I see, this is how it has to be 
 Caught in the corners of my mind, beginning over one more time 
 Taking me over, taking all that's mine, one more time 
 One more timeCome on 
 Save some for me, it's what I like 
 I wanna play, you know it's time 
 Something is calling, I can't keep from falling 
 Come on, it's on 
 You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside 
 Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time 
 Once I cave in, what can I fight? 
 I can never win 
 Myself, I don't like 
 I don't like, I don't like, I don't like 
 Something is calling, I can't keep from falling 
 Come on, it's on 
 You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside 
 Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time 
 This time, this time 
 For me inside, put me inside 
 Hold me this time, put me inside 
 Come on, it's on 
 Come on, it's on 
 Come on, it's on 
 Come on, come on, it's onNas: 
 Everybody's an Enemy 
 Tellin' me lies and it's killin' me 
 Why they all want to get rid of me 
 Everybody's my enemy 
 Several try to disguise the devil in them 
 Wantin' get into my cerebellum but I'm 
 Ready and willing to tell them I can't ---- with them 
 Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling 
 Like my dick does watching naked teachers 
 Do sick stuff on my born collection on TV 
 Nas: 
 Trust nobody 
 I don't know who to call a friend 
 They all just pretend to be 
 ---- Everybody this is to all of y'all 
 Cause everybody is an enemy x2 
 Nas: 
 Watching my own back 
 Strapped with chrome, to my homies 
 Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at? 
 'Cause to many didn't act like dykes, hermaphrodites 
 With benzene, amen 
 Look at the trash they biting 
 The life in times is kinda wetter 
 Like the time and life of the sandman 
 On Apollo theater 
 Imagine that from the black with a hook 
 Who pulls the wack talent off the stage 
 I'm in rage 
 Nas: 
 Trust nobody 
 I don't know who to call a friend 
 They all just pretend to be

 You fill your lies around me 
 And you think you've won 
 You feel you can control me 
 With the things you've done

 You think that you can play me 
 You're going to start to hate me 
 I feel that you disgraced me x5

 Pues, you know, you fuckin' call me the Caco, okay? 
 I keep asking, "What's your lie?" 
 It is disturbing, this isn't mine 
 Days keep passing, one notch at a time 
 I don't feel right 
 Please, God, let me sleep tonight 
 Everyday confronted circumvents giving in 
 I just wanna know why 
 Want to give it up, but I can't escape 
 Want to give it up, but I can't escape 
 Want to give it up, but I can't escape 
 Want to give it up, but I can't escape 
 I keep asking, "Can we please try?" 
 It is haunting, this takes my mind 
 Days keep passing, line after line 
 I don't feel right

 Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

 Our dreams are lost, just a fantasy 
 How many times have you been misguided? 
 How many times have your hopes been smited?

 Haunting me taking it's sweet time 
 Holding on I'm lost in a haze 
 Fighting life 'til the end of my days

 And see the light that has come unbound and 
 You're so cynical

 I would like to 
 Search inside 
 For all of the things that you will hide 
 What's the problem? 
 Can't you seem to 
 Open your body and let me touch you? 
 Do you ever 
 See it outside your fears? 
 Thinkin' about your life 
 Thinkin' about your inner fears 
 Do you ever 
 See it out from inside your fears? 
 Thinkin' about your life 
 Thinkin' about your fears 
 I want you to see 
 The life you have disguised. 
 The world of things that hurt you 
 Kept all these useless lies. 
 I want you to fear 
 Fill you on up inside 
 Once I took you in 
 I'll throw you out next time 
 I tried 
 You win 
 My life 
 Is rippin' your heart out and destroyin' my pain! 
 Go!

 Am I insane and dazed? 
 Am I too lost, to face this? 
 And what will it cost 
 To escape? 
 Nothing is right 
 I'm so scared.Are you ready? 
 This place inside my mind 
 A place I'd like to hide 
 You don't know the chances 
 What if I should die? 
 A place inside my brain 
 Another kind of pain 
 You don't know the chances 
 I'm so blind 
 Blind 
 Blind 
 Another means I'll find 
 To escape the pain inside 
 You don't know the chances 
 What if I should die? 
 A place inside my brain 
 Another kind of pain 
 You don't know the chances 
 I'm so blind 
 Blind 
 Blind 
 Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to 
 Live a life that seems to be 
 A lost reality 
 That I can never find a way to reach 
 My inner self-esteem is low 
 How deep can I go 
 In the ground that I lay 
 If I don't find a way to 
 See through the gray that clouds my mind 
 This time I look to see what's between the lines 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind 
 I'm blind 
 I'm blind 
 I'm blind 
 I'm blindWhat the fuck? 
 I'm so numb, therefore I can't relate 
 I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate 
 Really is it me, or is it fate? 
 Give me peace, or release for fuck sake 
 Give him something to say 
 Something super fly, never play 
 All I hear is disgrace 
 Erase them all and reclaim my place 
 In the past I was known as a freak 
 Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak 
 Save my ass, I got into this band 
 Never thought the band would pick on the man 
 Give him something to say 
 Something super fly, never play 
 All I hear is disgrace 
 Erase them all and reclaim my place 
 Reclaim my place 
 Reclaim my place 
 Reclaim my place 
 Say it to my face 
 So I look around at all these stupid little faces 
 Something I can never slap, but I embrace 
 You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be 
 You want to fuck around? Then come and fuck with me 
 You think you can't relate? 
 You'll never ever find 
 You think you feel my hate? 
 Look at me and you will find 
 My fate you always raped! 
 I will always be the sound 
 You want to fuck with me? 
 Come on, fuckin' play! 
 Now! 
 You can feel it now or be stoned! 
 Yes, I feel it come, right now! 
 You can feel it now or be stoned! 
 Yes, I feel it come, right now! 
 You can feel it now or be stoned! 
 Yes, I feel it come, bow down! 
 Bow down! 
 Bow down! 
 Bow down! 
 Give him something to say 
 Something super fly, never play 
 All I hear is disgrace 
 Erase them all and reclaim my place

 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Lock him up real tight 
 Throw away the key 
 And then turn off all the lights 
 First, we're going to set some bait 
 Inside a nasty trap and wait 
 When he comes a-sniffing 
 We will snap the trap and close the gate 
 Wait, I've got a better plan 
 To catch this big, red lobster man 
 Let's pop him in a boiling pot 
 And when he's done, we'll butter him up 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Throw him in a box 
 Bury him for ninety years 
 Then see if he talks 
 Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man 
 Can take the whole thing over then 
 He'll be so pleased, I do declare 
 That he will cook him rare 
 I say that we take a cannon 
 Aim it at his door 
 And then knock three times 
 And when he answers, Sandy Claws will be no more 
 You're so stupid, think now 
 If we blow him up to smithereens 
 We may lose some pieces 
 And then Jack will beat us black and green 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Tie him in a bag 
 Throw him in the ocean 
 Then see if he is sad 
 Because Mr. Oogie Boogie 
 Is the meanest guy around 
 If I were on his Boogie list 
 I'd get out of town 
 He'll be so pleased by our success 
 That he'll reward us, too, I bet 
 Perhaps he'll make his special brew 
 Of snake and spider stew 
 We're his little henchmen and 
 We take our job with pride 
 We do our best to please him 
 And to stay on his good side 
 I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb 
 I'm not the dumb one, you're no fun, shut up 
 I've got something, listen now 
 This one's real good, you'll see 
 We'll send a present to his door 
 Upon, there'll be a note to read 
 Now in the box, we'll wait and hide 
 Until his curiosity 
 Entices him to look inside 
 And then we'll have him one, two, three 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Beat him with a stick 
 Lock him up for ninety years 
 And see what makes him tick 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 Chop him into bits 
 Mr. Oogie Boogie 
 Is sure to get his kicks 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 See what we will see 
 Lock him in a cage and then 
 Throw away the key 
 Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
 See what we will see 
 Lock him in a cage and then 
 Throw away the keyIn der Angst kann man leben (wörtl. Angst ist ein Ort zum Leben)

 Obwohl ich eine Meile von dir entfernt bin, sehe ich dich 
 Du starrst weiterhin, wirkst als wolltest du sagen:

 Heuchlerische Missgeburten (wörtl. Falsche Arsch Menschen) umzingeln mich 
 Anfangs sind sie immer nett 
 Sie schlagen mit ihren Klauen

 Sie schlagen ihre Klauen genau in mich rein 
 Anfangs sind sie immer nett 
 Aber am Ende bin ich der Vollidiot (wörtl. Aber am Ende werde ich immer gefickt)

 Take a look around; no one can make me 
 Deep inside this space is where I hate me 
 Snuck a ride, I'm so alive, just save me 
 Hands on your head and your chest feeling tight 
 You wanna look around and shake me 
 You wanna fuck around and let me go this time 
 What's even worse, you tried to break me 
 You go and look around and see what you can find 
 See what you can find 
 You can find 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
 I know what you came here for: to tempt me 
 Quiet down the thoughts that brace to kick me 
 Either way I know that you'll resent me 
 Hands on your head and your chest feeling tight 
 You wanna look around and shake me 
 You wanna fuck around and let me go this time 
 What's even worse, you tried to break me 
 You go and look around and see what you can find 
 See what you can find

 Hurting, oh, where do I begin? 
 Screaming, they dance around my head, hoping they'll make me end up dead 
 Feeling it grab hold, what can I say? 
 Feeling fucked-up again 
 (I've gotta do this right) 
 I can't fucking give in 
 (I've given my goodbyes) 
 Can't I ever win? 
 (I'll scream with all my might) 
 Here it comes, again 
 Silence, it goes away 
 Patience, oh, really should I stay? 
 Trying so hard to get ahead, failure is often where I'm led

 Here it comes, againYou and me 
 We have no faces 
 Soon our lives will be erased. 
 Do you think they will remember? 
 Or will we just be replaced? 
 Oh I wish that I could see 
 How I wish that I could fly 
 All the things that hang above me 
 To a place where I can cry. 
 So what can it be? 
 No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me 
 No one's there. 
 To all these nameless feelings 
 I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people 
 Tryin' to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger 
 And stop (...) with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind. 
 You and me 
 We have no faces 
 They don't see us anymore 
 Without love as they had promised 
 And no faith for what's in store 
 Oh I wish that I could see 
 How I wish that I could fly 
 All the things that hang above me 
 To a place where I can cry. 
 So what can it be? 
 No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me 
 No one's there. 
 To all these nameless feelings 
 I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people 
 Tryin' to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger 
 And stop (...) with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind. 
 Where are all these feelings hiding? 
 Dancing in and out my mind 
 Burning up all that I long for 
 Feeding me till my decline. 
 Where are you? 
 My soul is bleeding 
 I am searching. 
 Am I blind? 
 All alone and bound forever 
 Trapped inside me for all time. 
 To all these nameless feelings 
 I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people 
 Tryin' to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger 
 And stop (...) with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind. 
 Far behind. 
 To leave these places far behind.Living life 
 Don't you cry 
 My life 
 Pain is God 
 Many nights 
 Painful thoughts occur 
 Yell at me, 
 Again I'm wrong 
 In denial 
 I tried to be your friend 
 I tried to be 
 A good boy 
 All I see 
 A hate deep inside 
 Startle me 
 Someone save me 
 Now these memories 
 Fill my heart 
 They bury me 
 All I want to do 
 (You are not my real mother) 
 Is kill you 
 (Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) 
 All I want to do 
 (You are not my real mother) 
 Is kill you 
 (Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) 
 All I want to do 
 (You are not my real mother) 
 Is kill you 
 (Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) 
 Looking back 
 I was never ever right 
 You were my stepmom 
 Who always wanted me out of your sight 
 I would come walking in and I'd say, "Hello" 
 But you would slap me 
 And you would make some fucked-up comment about my clothes 
 But I tried to let it pass 
 But the pictures in my head were with you 
 With a knife up your ass laying dead 
 So I popped some more caps in your ass 
 Now your son is not so fun 
 Motherfucking bitch, never try to play me! 
 You make my life 
 Not so good 
 All I want to do 
 Is kill you 
 All I want to do 
 Is kill you 
 All I want to do 
 (You are not my real mother) 
 Is kill you 
 (Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) 
 All I want to do 
 (You are not my real mother) 
 Is kill you 
 (Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) 
 Wish! 
 Ha ha! 
 You! 
 Ha! 
 Were dead! 
 Ha ha! 
 Now! 
 Ha ha! 
 Now I know. 
 How can I cry over someone I never loved? 
 Now I know. 
 How can I cry over someone I never loved? 
 Never loved 
 Never lovedNow look at you 
 You're like a train wreck that is in slow motion 
 If I were you 
 I'd trade away that every guilty notion 
 If this is true 
 Would you lie, would you cheat, would you try to remind me 
 Of something really new? 
 Still a dive in grasping in the emotion 
 Is it love? 
 But I'll never face the truth 
 I'm lost and out of you 
 I should've known 
 You're so cold and how could I be so clueless? 
 A thought you'd grown 
 But only grew more sick and in debt to stillness 
 I'd walk away 
 But the price is high and I guess I'll manage 
 I've done this great for two 
 And if you lay down will I still feel sadness? 
 Is it love? 
 But I'll never face the truth 
 I'm lost and out of you 
 I can't escape you, wish I could break this chain 
 I can't relate to these little fucking games 
 I can't escape you, wish I could break this chain 
 I can't relate to these little fucking games 
 I can't escape you, wish I could break this chain 
 I can't relate to these little fucking games 
 These little fucking games 
 These little fucking games 
 Is it love? 
 But I'll never face the truth 
 I'm lost and out of you 
 Out of you 
 Out of you 
 I can't escape you, wish I could break this chain 
 I can't relate to these little fucking games 
 I can't escape you, wish I could break this chain 
 I can't relate to these little fucking gamesI think this is the most talking I've ever done in my whole career. 
 We're gonna play Got The Life for y'all. 
 Hate, something, sometime, someway 
 Something kick down the front floor

 Inside always beating me 
 You'll never see 
 So come dance with me. 
 Dance with me. 
 Dance with me.

 The more I see the life. 
 Who wants to see? 
 God told me 
 I've already got the life. 
 Got The Life. (x9)I can't remember anything 
 Can't tell if this is true or dream 
 Deep down inside I feel the scream 
 This terrible silence stops with me 
 Now that the war is through with me 
 I'm waking up, I cannot see 
 That there's not much left of me 
 Nothing is real but pain now 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, wake me 
 Back in the womb it's much too real 
 In pumps life that I must feel 
 But can't look forward to reveal 
 Look to the time when I'll live 
 Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
 Just like a wartime novelty 
 Tied to machines that make me be 
 Cut this life off from me 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, wake me 
 Now the world is gone I'm just one 
 Oh God help me 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, help me 
 Darkness 
 Imprisoning me 
 All that I see 
 Absolute horror 
 I cannot live 
 I cannot die 
 Trapped in myself 
 Body my holding cell 
 Landmine has taken my sight 
 Taken my speech 
 Taken my hearing 
 Taken my arms 
 Taken my legs 
 Taken my soul 
 Left me with life in hellAl caer la noche, 
 La gente dormía, 
 En Jaral el progreso terminó. 
 La luna lo ocultaba, 
 Nadie se lo esperaba, 
 A jaral el infierno ya llegó. 
 Un mandato divino, 
 Quizá sólo el destino, 
 En Jaral el demonio apareció. 
 Abrió las cerraduras, 
 Liberó a sus criaturas, 
 ¡Oh si el infierno comenzó! 
 (Puente) 
 Creyeron que Jaral - ¡Estaba perdido! 
 Pero estaban mal - ¡Se equivocaron! 
 Apareció un mortal - Un salvador, 
 Desafió a Satanás - Con una baraja en la mano. 
 Caminó hacia la bestia, 
 Se paró frente a ella, 
 Y una de sus cartas él tomó. 
 Con fuerza impresionante, 
 Se inclinó 'pa delante: 
 La carta de su mano disparó. 
 Satanás rugió, 
 Pues la carta lo hirió, 
 Y el infierno se desplomo. 
 El guardó sus cartas, 
 Y se sacudió las palmas, 
 Y Jaral para siempre abandonó. 
 (CORO) 
 JARAL! ------ Del progreso

 A snapshot in the family album 
 Daddy, what else did you leave for me? 
 Daddy, whatcha leave behind for me? 
 All in all, it was just a brick in the wall 
 All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall 
 We don't need no education 
 We don't need no thought control 
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
 Teachers, leave them kids alone 
 Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone 
 All in all, it's just another brick in the wall 
 All in all, you're just another brick in the wall 
 We don't need no education 
 We dont need no thought control 
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
 Teachers, leave them kids alone 
 Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone 
 All in all, you're just another brick in the wall 
 All in all, you're just another brick in the wall 
 I don't need no arms around me 
 I don't need no drugs to calm me 
 I have seen the writing on the wall 
 Don't think I need anything at all 
 No, don't think I'll need anything at all 
 All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall 
 All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall 
 Goodbye, cruel world 
 I'm leaving you today 
 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
 Goodbye all you people 
 There's nothing you can say 
 To make me change my mind 
 Goodbyespoken: 
 We're doing this song. 
 Again we were tryin' to figure out different ways to make this. 
 Special and different because of the acoustic thing we're not really used to this. 
 And we decided to invite a Tyco and sound volume up to this. 
 These are Japenese Tyco drums and I think it's really amazing. 
 It's when we're all playing together. 
 So, um... I want to... I can do their thing in this song. 
 We're gonna go into a strum-y way we'll just let them go first. 
 ( 
 Singing: 
 ) 
 Flesh wound, flesh wound 
 With medication it will fade. 
 Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray? 
 Love full of hate. 
 Don't you love how I break? 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away. 
 Screwed up, used up 
 Crumpled lying on the floor 
 [...] Up, shut up 
 All you did back then was score 
 I'm feeling weak 
 Missing parts 
 Incomplete. 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away. 
 Don't let them throw me away. 
 Don't let them throw me away. 
 Hold me up into the light 
 Fix the cracks fix them right 
 Keep the pieces in the drawer 
 Keep them there for ever more 
 May come in use for someday 
 Recycle this [...] in someway 
 And all that I have to say 
 Please let them throw me away. 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away! 
 Ah-ha! 
 Don't let them throw me away. 
 spoken: 
 Thank you guys very much for coming out tonight. 
 It was awesome. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 Y'all have a good night.You can see I fly, 
 Disguise evil, trapped in every eye 
 You can watch me play 
 Taste your juices from me all day 
 You can see I try this all for you 
 You can see I despise all of you 
 You can see I'm trying something new 
 You can see me fly 
 Sometime, somewhere, 
 Deceit leads you nowhere 
 You try, so hard 
 To be the superstar 
 So come on with me 
 Take you on a slow ride, set you free 
 Someone can't you see 
 Going on this way, free you'll never be 
 So you see I try this all for you 
 So you see I despise all of you 
 So you see I trying something new 
 So you see me fly 
 Sometimes, somewhere, 
 Deceit leads you nowhere 
 You try, so hard 
 To be the superstar 
 Just take me away 
 Take me away (x 8) 
 Take me... 
 Sometimes, somewhere, 
 Deceit leads you nowhere 
 You try, so hard 
 To be the superstar 
 Take me away (x 5)...Honestly, somehow it always seems that 
 I'm dreamin' of somethin' I can never be 
 It doesn't matter to me 'cause I will 
 Always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies 
 I don't know your fuckin' name 
 So what, let's 
 Screamin' to be the only way that 
 I can truly be free from my fucked-up reality 
 So I dream and stroke it harder 'cause 
 It's so fun to see my face starin' back at me 
 I don't know your fuckin' name 
 So what, let's fuck 
 All day I dream about sex 
 All day I dream about fuckin' 
 All day I dream about fuckin' 
 All day I dream about sex 
 Yes, all day I dream about sex 
 And all day I dream about sex 
 Yes, all day I dream about sex 
 And all day I dream about sex 
 Yes, all day I dream about sex

 All day I dream about sex 
 All day I dream about fuckin' 
 All day I dream about sex 
 All day I dream about fuckin'Blood is pouring, sleep is pouring 
 Don't stop running, I'm here counting 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 Will he keep fuckin' with me? 
 There's nowhere else to go 
 So I walk but seem to crawl, for I'm giving in today 
 Now I run into a wall, 'cause I cannot fight my way 
 You've gotta come with me 
 (I cannot stand this place) 
 We're falling off the world 
 (And I'll give in this way) 
 We had a chance to run 
 (And now I can't believe) 
 We're going all the way 
 (And now to death's embrace) 
 My lies, worry, life is story 
 Give up beating, I'll start needing 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 The lies, the pain, the pain, the hate 
 Will he keep fuckin' with me? 
 There's nowhere else to go 
 So I walk but seem to crawl, for I'm giving in today 
 Now I run into a wall, 'cause I cannot fight my way 
 You've gotta come with me 
 (I cannot stand this place) 
 We're falling off the world 
 (And I'll give in this way) 
 We had a chance to run 
 (And now I can't believe) 
 We're going all the way 
 (And now to death's embrace) 
 Embrace, embrace 
 Oh, uh, uh, uh oh 
 Uh, uh, uh oh 
 Uh, uh, uh oh 
 Uh, uh, uh oh 
 Why really do I have to follow? 
 Nothing makes sense at all 
 Taking something for nothing 
 Watch me as I fall 
 I'm bringing me down, I'm bringing me down 
 I'm bringing me down, I'm bringing me down 
 I'm bringing me down 
 You've gotta come with me 
 (I cannot stand this place) 
 We're falling off the world 
 (And I'll give in this way) 
 We had a chance to run 
 (And now I can't believe) 
 We're going all the way 
 (And now to death's embrace) 
 You've gotta come with me 
 (I cannot stand this place) 
 We're falling off the world 
 (And I'll give in this way) 
 We had a chance to run 
 (And now I can't believe) 
 We're going all the way 
 (And now to death's embrace)I never knew what I was gonna be 
 Somebody saw what I couldn't see and lifted me up 
 Now, I never thought I could be worthy of 
 Lovin' and care in the sky above 
 Don't let the thunder fall 
 Why does everybody have to fit in? 
 Feel so damn comfortable in the skin 
 Does that mean I am the 
 Souvenir of sadness? 
 Method to the madness? 
 Hands up, if you feel this 
 Anyone who has this 
 Stand up, nobody's dying to save you 
 Speak up, nobody's waiting to see you 
 Wake up, nobody's working to pay you 
 Let me make it clear, you had this 
 Back then, nobody knew in the schoolyard 
 Now then, you had grown up to be this whore 
 Go then, walk through this world with your heart scarred 
 You're the souvenir of sadness 
 They never knew what I was gonna say 
 Punch me and kick me and run away 
 You know who you are 
 So now, look at me, what do you have to say? 
 Never cared much for you anyway 
 You know who you are 
 So now, look at me, what do you have to say? 
 Never cared much for you any- 
 We're happy childhood back-lash 
 Souvenir of sadness? 
 Method to the madness? 
 Hands up, if you feel this 
 Anyone who has this 
 Stand up, nobody's dying to save you 
 Speak up, nobody's waiting to see you 
 Wake up, nobody's working to pay you 
 Let me make it clear, you had this 
 Back then, nobody knew in the schoolyard 
 Now then, you had grown up to be this whore 
 Go then, walk through this world with your heart scarred 
 You're the souvenir of sadness

 Now then, you had grown up to be this whore 
 Go then, walk through this world with your heart scarred 
 You're the souvenir of sadnessA slap in the face, it is endowed 
 The light of my life is put out somehow 
 I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control 
 You're feeding my sympathy the lie unfolds 
 Feeling this hostility, I pray 
 Begging, make this evil go away 
 Coveting the things I only fear 
 Building my sanctuary of blood and tears 
 The lines that I traced 
 Around the scars they swell 
 Implant with a sedative 
 To numb this spell 
 I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control 
 You're feeding this cancer 
 It's taken hold 
 Feeling this hostility, I pray 
 Begging, make this evil go away 
 Coveting the things I only fear 
 Building my sanctuary of blood and tears 
 Feeling animosity 
 When no one else is around 
 Blindly, I scream into the air 
 Eating my heart off the ground 
 Feeling this hostility, I pray 
 Begging, make this evil go away 
 Coveting the things I only fear 
 Building my sanctuary of blood and tears 
 Ground!I'm staring at a face I don't recognize 
 Rotten and replaced, lifeless and benign 
 You can never say, that I didn't try 
 I cannot erase what's in my mind 
 I'm the one to give to you, I'm the one to break you through 
 Anything you ever do will eat you up and impale you 
 I'm bleeding out, been crucified by trusting you 
 Hate turns to shame by praising you, adoring fool 
 I'm the one that set you free, bound to burn for eternity, 'cause I'm bleeding out 
 You're never there when I need you 
 My thoughts, they interlace, been spun out for sometime 
 I wander in this maze, an act that is sublime 
 You can never say, that I didn't try 
 I cannot erase what's in my mind 
 I'm the one to give to you, I'm the one to break you through 
 Anything you ever do will eat you up and impale you 
 I'm bleeding out, been crucified by trusting you 
 Hate turns to shame by praising you, adoring fool 
 I'm the one that set you free, bound to burn for eternity, 'cause I'm bleeding out 
 You're never there when I need you 
 I'm bleeding out, been crucified by trusting you 
 Hate turns to shame by praising you, adoring fool 
 I'm the one that set you free, bound to burn for eternity, 'cause I'm bleeding out 
 You're never there when I need youDo you really want to see? 
 I don't think I can take this anymore 
 You are naive & I am nothing 
 I'm disgusting and so much more. 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Feeling like somehow I spoiled you 
 Dying is a trial I've been to 
 This is the time for truth and pain. 
 Do you really want to see the torment hatred of this world? 
 Hand in a book & I believed it 
 All it brought me was pain and more. 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Feeling like somehow I spoiled you 
 Dying is a trial I've been to 
 This is the time for truth and pain. 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Feeling like somehow I spoiled you 
 Dying is a trial I've I been to 
 This is the time for truth and pain. 
 I believe. I believe. 
 Holding All These Lies I told you. 
 Holding All The Lies I told you. 
 Holding All These Lies I told you! 
 Holding All These Lies I told you. 
 Lies I told you... 
 Holding All The Lies I told you 
 Feeling like somehow I spoiled you 
 Dying is a trial I've been to 
 This is the time for truth and pain. 
 Truth is pain. 
 Truth is pain. 
 Truth is pain. 
 Truth is pain. 
 Truth is pain. 
 I believe 
 I never meant to hurt you. 
 I believe 
 I never meant to betray you. 
 I never meant to hurt you. 
 I never meant to hurt you.Cracked phone line 
 Means nothing 
 My brain's in fights and vain 
 My breathing 
 So shallow 
 It helps to curb the pain 
 What's outside? 
 Sneaks inside 
 How we contaminate 
 This warzone of my soul 
 I underestimate 
 I've never really thought about it that much 
 It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this way 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this way 
 The pills they, quit working 
 They take more than they give 
 Emotions on flat line 
 It's all that I can give 
 The rising 
 The falling 
 My mind keeps tricking me 
 It throws me a life raft 
 Then leaves me out at sea 
 I've never really thought about it that much 
 It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this way 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this way 
 I've never really thought about it that much 
 It's only ever violence that's in my touch 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this way 
 Appears, appears, appears 
 I am built this wayPut your hand against your skin 
 Rub it gently to begin 
 You feel it? 
 Can you feel it? 
 When does pleasure become pain? 
 When does sex become insane? 
 You say it 
 As you feel it 
 When you come 
 (Be a good girl) 
 Hold your breath 
 (Make it last long) 
 It's a mess 
 (And it's called) 
 "The little death" girl 
 So please 
 When you die could you scream? 
 Mercy 
 Mercy for you and me 
 It's true 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drug 
 So please 
 When you cry let it flow 
 I might 
 Make you stay, let you go 
 It's true 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drug 
 Push that one more time that's all 
 And the rain begins to fall 
 You feel it? 
 Can you feel it? 
 People who ain't seen shit been 
 Telling you that it's a sin 
 You say it 
 As you feel it 
 When you come 
 (Be a good girl) 
 Hold your breath 
 (Make it last long) 
 It's a mess 
 (And it's called) 
 "The little death" girl 
 So please 
 When you die could you scream? 
 Mercy 
 Mercy for you and me 
 It's true 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drug 
 So please 
 When you cry let it flow

 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drug 
 So please 
 When you cry let it flow 
 I might 
 Make you stay, let you go 
 It's true 
 What they say fucking for love might be the last legal drugFeeling really out of place 
 Spent beyond too much time 
 Alone for a lifetime searching for things I will never find 
 I am here to take, 
 Whatever I feel is mine 
 Feeling like I'm never needed, 
 Walking alone, blind. 
 Once upon a time 
 I Never thought I'd end up dead 
 For the thoughts that's in my head, 
 From time to time. 
 Once upon a time 
 Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down... 
 Looking at another face 
 Looking for another sign 
 Alone in my bed, wasted, without fear, waiting for my time. 
 Once upon a time 
 I Never thought I'd end up dead 
 For the thoughts that's in my head 
 From time to time. 
 Once upon a time 
 Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down... 
 I don't understand here 
 Why God would do me this way. 
 I lived a life 
 Was always good 
 The one thing I need to take away 
 To take away 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 Just take away 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 One thing to take away 
 The one thing (Take away!) 
 One thing to take away 
 Away! Away! 
 It took away my world 
 All it left was pain 
 And all this time was for nothing 
 Once upon a time 
 I Never thought I'd end up dead 
 For the thoughts that's in my head, 
 From time to time. 
 Once upon a time 
 Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down...Flesh wound, flesh wound 
 With medication it will fade 
 Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray 
 Love, full of hate. 
 Don't you love how I break? 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay 
 Aha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Screwed up, used up 
 Crumpled lying on the floor 
 Fucked-up, shut up 
 All you did back then was score 
 I'm feeling weak 
 Missing parts 
 Incomplete. 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay 
 Aha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Hold me up into the light 
 Fix the cracks and fix them right 
 Keep the pieces in the drawer 
 Keep them there for ever more 
 May come in use for someday 
 Recycle this shit in someway 
 And all that I have to say 
 Is don't let them throw me away. 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Keep me and I'll be okay 
 Aha! 
 Skipping a beat but it plays 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 Aha! 
 Don't let them throw me away 
 (Almost silent) Away... [until end]We got a fucked-up reason to live 
 Who really gives a fuck? 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it up 
 You gotta get it straight, we're gonna give it up 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it up 
 I am the burden of my everything and of it's scar 
 I'll be reborn in hatred, feeling I can't love no more 
 I've had to suffer, I cannot wait for more 
 No loving and no praying, all my life is for the taking 
 We got a fucked-up reason to live 
 Who really gives a fuck? 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it up 
 You gotta get it straight, we're gonna give it up 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it up 
 I am the falling of my happiness, it is no more 
 Stop loving, I'm still hating 'til I cannot hate no more 
 I've had to suffer, I cannot wait for more 
 No loving and no praying, all my life is for the taking 
 I'm filthy, wasted piece of shit 
 I am disgusting, take me away 
 We got a fucked-up reason to live 
 Who really gives a fuck? 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it up

 We got a fucked-up reason to live 
 Who really gives a fuck? 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna fuck you up 
 I wanna break everything, I wanna make it sting 
 We're gonna wake up hate, we're gonna wake it upI'm digging with my fingertips, I'm gripping at the ground I stand upon 
 I'm searching for fragile bones 
 (Evolution) 
 I'm never gonna be refined, keep trying but I won't assimilate 
 Should we have come far in time? 
 (Watch the bow break) 
 And I'm sorry I don't believe, by the evidence that I see, that there's any hope left for me 
 It's evolution, just evolution 
 And I, I do not dare deny the basic beast inside 
 It's right here, it's controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die? 
 I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside 
 Close up to get a real good view, I'm betting that the species will survive 
 Hold tight, I'm getting inside you 
 (Evolution) 
 And when we're gonna find these bones, they're gonna wanna keep them in a jar 
 The number one virus caused by procreation 
 And the planet may go astray in a million years, I say 
 Those motherfuckers were all deranged 
 It's evolution, just evolution 
 And I, I do not dare deny the basic beast inside 
 It's right here, it's controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die? 
 I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside 
 Take a look around 
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around) 
 Nothing much has changed 
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around) 
 Take a look around 
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around) 
 Nothing much has changed 
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around) 
 Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around 
 (Nothing much has changed) 
 Take a look around, take a look around 
 (Nothing much has changed) 
 Take a look around, take a look around 
 (Nothing much has changed) 
 Take a look around 
 And I, I do not dare deny the basic beast inside 
 It's right here, it's controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die? 
 I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside 
 Why? 
 (Why? Why? Why?) 
 Why do I deserve to die? 
 (Do I deserve to die? Why? Why? Why?)I'm falling in this pit of sorrow 
 I really don't care anyway 
 Happiness I'm looking to borrow 
 Even four last seconds okay 
 I'm starting to feel so hollow 
 Fill me up then go on your way 
 I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow 
 So I'll just do my best anyway 
 Hold me now, I've been knocking down 
 Killing all these waves of shame 
 Hold me down, feeling not so sound 
 Wish I wasn't born today 
 I'm starting to break my devotion 
 What does that mean anyway? 
 Running into signs interwoven 
 So much that it gets in my way 
 I'm starting to feel so hollow 
 Fill me up then go on your way 
 I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow 
 So I'll just do my best anyway 
 Hold me now, I've been knocking down 
 Killing all these waves of shame 
 Hold me down, feeling not so sound 
 Wish I wasn't born today 
 Hold me now, I've been knocking down 
 Killing all these waves of shame. 
 Hold me down, feeling not so sound 
 Wish I wasn't born todayRealized I can never win 
 Sometimes feel like I have failed 
 Inside, where do I begin? 
 My mind is laughing at me 
 Tell me, why am I to blame? 
 Aren't we supposed to be the same? 
 That's why I will never tame 
 This thing that's burning in me 
 I am the one who chose my path 
 I am the one who couldn't last 
 I feel the life pulled from me 
 I feel the anger changing me 
 Sometimes, I can never tell 
 If I've got something after me 
 That's why I just beg and plead 
 For this curse to leave me 
 Tell me why am I to blame? 
 Aren't we supposed to be the same? 
 That's why I will never tame 
 This thing that's burning in me 
 I am the one who chose my path 
 I am the one who couldn't last 
 I feel the life pulled from me 
 (it's burning in me) 
 I feel the anger changing me 
 Betrayed 
 I feel so enslaved 
 I really tried 
 I did my time 
 I did my time 
 I did my time 
 I did my time 
 I did my time 
 I am the one who chose my path 
 I am the one who couldn't last 
 I feel the life pulled from me 
 (it's burning in me) 
 I feel the anger changing me 
 Oh God, the anger's changing me 
 Oh God, the anger's changing meThis shit right here is for you 
 All your faces I can see 
 You all think its about me 
 I'm about to break 
 This is my fate 
 Am I still damned to a life 
 Of misery and hate? 
 You will never know 
 What I've done for you 
 What you all 
 Put me through 
 I do it for you. 
 I could have 
 Never lived 
 If it wasn't for you.I can't believe what's happening 
 Where is your self control 
 Why can't you just be honest 
 The corruption takes its toll 
 You rape our hope 
 Too proud to cope 
 You built this house of shame 
 You smile, you gloat 
 This disease you promote 
 An infection is what we are now 
 I can't believe this happened 
 The fear starts to grab hold 
 Then anger starts to take over 
 I will not be controlled 
 You rape our hope 
 Too proud to cope 
 You built this house of shame 
 You smile, you gloat 
 This disease you promote 
 An infection is what we are now 
 They're taking over now 
 Eating up our souls somehow 
 Taking over now 
 Parasites, they run around 
 The culprits won't be found 
 They lie behind this mask of wealth 
 They're taking over now 
 Illuminati they hide 
 You rape our hope 
 Too proud to cope 
 You built this house of shame 
 You smile, you gloat 
 This disease you promote 
 An infection is what we are now 
 You rape our hope 
 Too proud to cope 
 You built this house of shame 
 You smile, you gloat

 You need a reason to believe 
 A reason to deceive 
 A reason for the song you're singing 
 And everything you do 
 Makes perfect sense to you 
 So why is your alarm bell ringing 
 You say you know how it feels inside of me 
 Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
 Come on inside 
 And hear the silence constantly judging me 
 Don't you think you should move on? 
 Oh, now you're so fucking holy 
 You need a way to get along 
 A way to carry on 
 A symptom for the pain you're making 
 And surely you should know 
 That everywhere you go 
 There's acid in the words you're faking 
 You say you know how it feels inside of me 
 Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
 Come on inside 
 And hear the silence constantly judging me 
 Don't you think you should move on? 
 You write it, so you'd best believe it 
 You sold it, now your soul perceives it 
 You waver, but for now agree with it 
 The damage and betrayal 
 To hell with the 
 Reason to believe 
 A reason to deceive 
 A reason for the song you're singing 
 And everything you do 
 Makes perfect sense to you 
 So why is your alarm bell ringing 
 You say you know how it feels inside of me 
 Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
 Come on inside 
 And hear the silence constantly judging me 
 Don't you think you should move on? 
 Don't you think you should move on? 
 Don't you think you should move on?Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away 
 I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I would stay 
 I feel so lost within, pressured, I'm headed for that day 
 Just one thought in my head, really. Do I need this fame? 
 Every time, goddamn, I look at my seed, I see something I can't be 
 Beautiful and carefree, that's how I used to be 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak 
 Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe 
 I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way? 
 It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame 
 Every time, goddamn, I look at my seed, I see something I can't be 
 Beautiful and carefree, that's how I used to be 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak 
 Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe 
 So I see this face, so innocent and fine... and so fine 
 So I see this face and I realize it's mine 
 I feel the rattle... 
 So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine. 
 So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 
 I feel the rattle... 
 Every time, goddamn, I look at my seed, I see something I can't be 
 Beautiful and carefree, that's how I used to be 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak 
 Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak! 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak! 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak! 
 Like some goddamn fuckin' freak!Life is within' my body.

 Thanking all the fucked people 
 Thanking all the shit I love 
 They are all the things I've made 
 Straight from my heart 
 Begging all the same people 
 Burning is the same evil 
 Somehow making me feel sane 
 Waiting all this time 
 I've got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my life 
 I can see before I'm gone 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
 All the hate that's breaking me 
 I realise I'm taking everything 
 And the kids seem to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me 
 To a place I'm hate to be 
 All along I seem to make believe 
 And the shit seems to follow 
 I'm thinking of 
 Making all the fucked people 
 Making the bitches I love 
 Make them die and go away 
 Pain from the start 
 All my dreams are ripped apart 
 Thanking all the fucked people 
 They are all the things I've saved 
 Waiting all this time 
 I've got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my life 
 I can see before I'm gone 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
 All the hate that's breaking me 
 I realise I'm taking everything 
 And the kids seem to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me 
 To a place I'm meant to be 
 All along I seem to make believe 
 And the shit seems to follow 
 Your life, I hate it 
 Oh God, can I reclaim? 
 Stop and help me 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me 
 All the hate that's breaking me 
 I realise I'm taking everything 
 And the shit seems to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me 
 To a place I'm meant to be 
 All along I seem to make believe 
 And the shit seems to follow 
 The shit seems to followEveryone is looking at me 
 I can't get out of bed 
 There is evil in my head 
 Everyone just let me be 
 Because when I hit the stage 
 It is gone and I am free 
 Goddamn you say you'll get up with me 
 You're the crowd, come on give it back to me 
 You won't Beg For Me, Beg For Me, Beg For Me 
 Goddamn you say you'll get up with me 
 You're the crowd, come on give it back to me 
 You won't Beg For Me, be there for me, Beg For Me 
 Tell me, how could this fade? 
 I am going insane 
 And I could not have my pain 
 Everyone please let me be 
 'Cause when I hit the stage 
 It is gone and I am free 
 Goddamn you say you'll get up with me 
 You're the crowd, come on give it back to me 
 You won't Beg For Me, Beg For Me, Beg For Me 
 Goddamn you say you'll get up with me 
 You're the crowd, come on give it back to me 
 You won't Beg For Me, be there for me, Beg For Me 
 I feel the shame; I've gone insane 
 The things I feel now aren't the same 
 Who gives a fuck if my life sucks? 
 I just know one thing: I won't give up 
 Everyone just let me be

 Buried so far away. 
 Into my life of nothing. 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 I am so high always. 
 Burying my life so slowly. 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 It opens my mind to feelings. 
 Can't face boredom without something. 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same old thing 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Re-entering my head, 
 Feeling like I'm God 
 With the world around me. 
 Can't you feel this pain? 
 Reaming through my heart! 
 Screaming through my veins! 
 Nothing I can kill! 
 Screaming a 
 Lie 
 I 
 Am 
 Can't you tear 
 My 
 Eyes 
 Out? 
 Can't you take my heart? 
 Away 
 To heart 
 Good-bye 
 Sick of the same old thing

 Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse 
 Ride on the outside, with inner force 
 Throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway 
 We mash, like the first kickoff, on a Sunday 
 Collisions, divisions of niggaz, down to listen 
 And when we on the mission, call your mortician 
 Join the party, I can provide the army! 
 First we flank 'em then we spank em... I outrank em! 
 You can call me Citizen Kane, for my reign 
 Ten years great, one of the ten great 
 Mr. Media, look inside your encyclopedia

 Worldwide, your highness, the finest 
 Big as China, nigga rhymer, chart climber 
 Quick to send a first-timer back to his Aunt Jemimah 
 Physi-cal, nigga roll with the winners 
 After these dinners, go out and represent us 
 We got antennas, scanners and satellites 
 To see if you battle right, we got to bite 
 Hold on tight, shake, and pump venom 
 Some haters don't learn till you leave lead in em 
 See the dead in em, rigarmortis spread in em 
 Keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin mouth slug 
 See these crossed legs, quick to cross Feds 
 Foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son 
 Fuck dying! [echoes]

 Something lost and never seen 
 Every time I start to believe 
 Something's raped and taken from me, from me 
 Life's got to always be messing with me 
 You wanna see the light 
 Can't they chill and let me be free? 
 So do I 
 Can't I take away all this pain? 
 You wanna see the light 
 I try to every night, all in vain, in vain 
 Sometimes I cannot take this place 
 Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
 Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
 You'll never see me fall from grace 
 Something takes a part of me 
 You and I were meant to be 
 A cheap fuck for me to lay 
 Something takes a part of me 
 Feeling like a freak on a leash 
 You wanna see the light 
 Feeling like I have no release 
 So do I 
 How many times have I felt diseased? 
 You wanna see the light 
 Nothing in my life is free, is free 
 Sometimes I cannot take this place 
 Sometimes it's my life I can't taste 
 Sometimes I cannot feel my face 
 You'll never see me fall from grace

 Been bleeding too long 
 Right here, right now 
 I'll stop it somehow 
 I will make it go away 
 Can't be here no more 
 Seems this is the only way 
 I will soon be gone 
 These feelings will be gone 
 These feelings will be gone 
 Now I see the times they changed 
 Leaving doesn't seem so strange 
 I am hoping I can find 
 Where to leave my hurt behind 
 All the shit I seem to take 
 All alone I seem to break 
 I have lived the best I can 
 Does this make me not a man? 
 Shut me off 
 I'm ready 
 Heart stops 
 I stand alone 
 Can't be on my own 
 I will make it go away 
 Can't be here no more 
 Seems this is the only way 
 I will soon be gone 
 These feelings will be gone 
 These feelings will be gone

 Does this make me not a man? 
 Am I going to leave this place? 
 What is it I'm running from? 
 Is there nothing more to come? 
 Am I gonna leave this place? 
 Is it always black in space? 
 Am I going to take its place? 
 Am I going to win this race? 
 Am I going to win this race? 
 I guess God's up in this place 
 What is it that I've become? 
 Is there something more to come? 
 More to come 
 Now I see the times they change 
 Leaving doesn't seem so strange 
 I am hoping I can find 
 Where to leave my hurt behind

 Slapped her in the head, stepped on her corns 
 Don't fuck with mine bitch, word is born 
 Went downstairs to eat wit my folks 
 Ma, you broke my fuckin' egg yoke! 
 Punch her in the chest, cut on her cheek 
 Then I did a sweep, knocked the bitch off her feet 
 Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull 
 AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple 
 Pops got mad cause mom got licked 
 I didn't give a fuck so I shot him in the dick 
 Hungry as fuck, said my grace 
 Pop kept screamin so I shot him in the face 
 Ate my food, found my coat 
 Mailman came so I cut his motherfuckin throat 
 Waitin for the motherfuckin school bus!

 Your life's a lie

 You try so hard to be wanted 
 False emotions tears you fronted 
 I feel being a person relies on one thing, be yourself, let you come through 
 You're too afraid to really be someone who isn't false, who doesn't care to be 
 You're too afraid to really be, be yourself, let you come through

 Feeding this hunger deep inside that never lives 
 The voice within eats me up inside 
 One, I love hurting you 
 Two, I love your pain 
 Three, let's get together and play the sinner's game 
 Four is for the torture and five is for the shame 
 'Cause every time you want it, I get off on this game 
 You wanted to play, the coldness follows 
 This isn't a game, your life, I'll swallow 
 And I can't help but smile at your pain 
 You wanted to play, but I already won 
 Gloating, I plant the seed inside your head right away, watch it grow 
 Destroying your insides, pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways 
 I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile

 I look at you and start to crack, start to crack 
 I give into, you take it back, take it back 
 This lullaby is all you have, all you have 
 Sadistic pleasure, I attack, I attack 
 I attack, I attack, I attack

 This isn't a game, your life, I'll swallow 
 And I can't help but smile at your pain 
 You wanted to play, but I already won 
 I already won, I already wonWith such ideals (the world it at my feet) 
 It seemed to stay that way a while (kissing sweet defeat) 
 Without its touch I fear I'm meat, 
 Standing here without a cause. 
 Maybe its better this way, 
 Silence my sweet release.What's your lie? 
 Warm glance, a fake smile. 
 Eyes meet, your mind runs wild. 
 This game you play I like in a way. 
 You expect to grab a child (grab a child) 
 You think I'm innocent not wild. 
 Take me let's see how much I'm tamed. 
 Everybody listen while I think of all I know, 
 How to live for sure - body wall into my precious soul. 
 I'll show you fears, pleasure pain is my control. 
 Let your body lay in there, warm flesh to your fear. 
 Warm lips, a big smile. 
 Hatred runs through your insides. 
 This game you play - intimidation each day. 
 You think it's all a lie (all a lie) 
 They want to destroy your life. 
 Anger twisted your life into pain 
 I wish I could take control. 
 I wish I could let go. 
 I wish I could break this mould.

 (Gasp)Lies 
 Things keep ending up this way 
 (Come and get off) 
 Another notch is carved away 
 In the thoughts of mass decay 
 Funny how things end up this way 
 Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
 Growing deep within my head 
 Softly dying, its soul is shed 
 Eating me all up inside 
 This cancer finds everything I hide 
 Living my life horrified 
 Nothing will keep this pacified 
 And out my life 
 Lies 
 Does nobody know I'm insane? 
 Satisfaction is delayed 
 (Come and get off) 
 Its motivation is displayed 
 Finding its misogyny 
 Funny how I die and go away

 Beaten down, dominated by its sound 
 Growing deep within my head 
 Softly dying, its soul is shed 
 Eating me all up inside 
 This cancer finds everything I hide 
 Living my life horrified 
 Nothing will keep this pacified 
 And out my life

 Does nobody know I'm insane?

 The pressure's building I foresee, 
 Alienation's lurking 
 Spawning lunacy. 
 Slowly escaping 
 This wreckage in making 
 So don't look back for me. 
 Sometimes we take it all. 
 Nothing stands in our way. 
 We have to fight and crawl 
 To die another day. 
 Die another day. 
 Die another day. 
 Misery often misleads. 
 It creates things we cannot see. 
 Excessive thoughts are bound 
 Distorting reality.

 This carnage in making 
 So don't look back for me.

 Nothing stands in our way.

 How come won't you listen? 
 I really don't care.

 Nothing will be the same. 
 So don't look back for me.

 I get disgusted, can't do it today 
 What makes it so good 
 That a man would kill for it 
 Lie just to lick a bit 
 Each time I pull it apart

 What makes it so good 
 To lie just to lick 
 Fake it, you like it, just take me away 
 Hold it, just save it and I'll be repaid 
 Each time I pull it apart 
 I get disgusted, can't do it today 
 What makes it so good 
 That a man would kill for it 
 To lie just to lick a bit 
 Each time I pull it apart 
 I get disgusted, can't do it today 
 What makes it so good 
 To lie, to lick 
 Take it, enlarge it, became it, before 
 Like it or hate it and I'll be justified 
 Why, why, what, wha', what for? 
 Fake it then like it, then like it again, psycho

 Sound of the fucking drummer 
 Music hitting your heart 'cause I know you got soul (Brothers and sisters) 
 Listen if you're missing y'all 
 Swinging while I'm singing 
 Giving whatcha getting 
 Knowing what I know 
 While the whole bands sweating 
 {And the rhythm rhymes rolling} 
 Got to give us what we want (Ho)

 What counts is that the rhyme 
 Designed to fill your mind 
 Now that you've realized the prides arrived 
 We got to pump the stuff to make us tough 
 From the heart 
 It's a start 
 A work of art 
 To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange 
 People, people we are the same 
 No we're not the same 
 'Cause we don't know the game 
 What we need is awareness 
 We can't get careless 
 You say what is this? (What is this)

 But fading to black 
 I'm offering peace 
 As I'm stabbed in the back 
 Yet I'm feeling ignored 
 My house is made of steel 
 With paper for doors 
 I've tried to hate you 
 But feel regret

 I've lost the bet 
 I'm waiting to watch it 
 I'm waiting to see 
 Is this my overture? Or obituary? 
 I'm holding the torch 
 But melting my fists 
 I'm first in the line 
 Yet last on the list

 She drank a tinful, she copied, we exchanged some info 
 Called her on the tele, conversation was sinful 
 Ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo

 Nymphos in the park, just dancin' in the rain 
 Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim

 Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten

 Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love

 The regolith plume thrown up by the collision...

 Possibly in the form of ice, hydrocarbons or hydrated materials...

 Will have the best opportunity because the sky will still be dark.

 Über-timeI'll die smiling, something perverse someone says to me will 
 Make me laugh, and I'll lay back and fade away 
 Let me go, I'll be fine frozen here in time 
 Sick of being alive 
 Eaten up inside, let me die, go away 
 I never got what I wanted, I never got what I needed 
 What's on my mind? Who can say? 
 It's my infection I'm feeding, I cannot stop all this bleeding 
 I'll be ready, give me the morphine and I'll go to sleep 
 As I dream, maybe I will just slide away 
 Let me go, I'll be fine frozen here in time 
 Sick of being alive 
 Eaten up inside, let me die, go away 
 I never got what I wanted, I never got what I needed 
 What's on my mind? Who can say?

 Listening to your twisted transistor 
 Hold it between your legs, turn it up, turn it up 
 The wind is coming through, can't get enough 
 A lonely life where no one understands you 
 But don't give up, because the music do 
 Music do, music do 
 Music do, music do 
 Music do, music do 
 Because the music do, and then it's reaching 
 Inside you, forever preaching 
 Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor 
 Hey you, hey you, finally you get it 
 The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it 
 And as your tears fall on your breast, your dress 
 Vibrations coming through, you're in a mess 
 A lonely life where no one understands you 
 But don't give up, because the music do 
 Music do, music do

 Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor.My life is such a waste, begging for something to work this time 
 But why can't I relate? Feeling all I do is get what's mine 
 Holding on to faith, never gave me nothing but despair 
 So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
 I can't take, we have a star 
 I can't take, we've got a fantasy 
 Come what may, we are the stars 
 I can't wait, I'll take what's mine 
 Been hating all this time, before I crawled inside 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 I cannot take this place, burning up inside this space of mine 
 But why can't I replace feelings I find hard to really find? 
 I try but I can't taste 
 Memories, they always fuck with me 
 So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
 I can't take, we have a star 
 I can't take, we've got a fantasy 
 Come what may, we are the stars 
 I can't wait, I'll take what's mine 
 Been hating all this time, before I crawled inside 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 All my feelings have been eating all of me 
 Feeling tired, is there something wrong with me? 
 I can't take, we have a star 
 I can't take, we've got a fantasy 
 Come what may, we are the stars 
 I can't wait, I'll take what's mine 
 Been hating all this time, before I crawled inside 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find 
 Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line 
 Been hating all the faces of everything that I could findDu und ich 
 Wir haben keine Gesichter 
 Bald werden unsere Leben ausgelöscht worden sein 
 Glaubst du sie werden sich an uns erinnern? 
 Oder werden wir durch jemand anderen ersetzt 
 Oh, ich wünschte ich könnte sehen 
 Wie sehr ich mir wünsche ich könnte fliegen 
 Weit weg von den Sachen, die über mir hängen 
 Zu einem Ort, an dem ich heulen kann 
 Warum also kann es sein? 
 Niemand hört mich rufen 
 Das Echo schallt zu mir zurück 
 Keiner von ihnen ist da 
 Mit all diesen namenlosen Gefühlen kann ich in meinem Leben nicht umgehen 
 Mit all diesen gierigen Menschen, die versuchen zu fressen was mir gehört 
 Ihr müsst euren Hunger füllen und aufhören meinen Verstand zu ficken 
 Ich weiß, dass es an der Zeit ist, diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassen 
 Du und ich 
 Wir haben keine Gesichter 
 Sie sehen uns nicht einmal mehr 
 Ohne Liebe, wie sie es versprochen haben 
 Und kein Glaube an das was im Lager ist 
 Oh, ich wünschte ich könnte sehen 
 Wie sehr ich mir wünsche ich könnte fliegen 
 Weit weg von den Sachen, die über mir hängen 
 Zu einem Ort, an dem ich heulen kann 
 Warum also kann es sein? 
 Niemand hört mich rufen 
 Das Echo schallt zu mir zurück 
 Keiner von ihnen ist da 
 Mit all diesen namenlosen Gefühlen kann ich in meinem Leben nicht umgehen 
 Mit all diesen gierigen Menschen, die versuchen zu fressen was mir gehört 
 Ihr müsst euren Hunger füllen und aufhören meinen Verstand zu ficken 
 Ich weiß, dass es an der Zeit ist, diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassen 
 Wo verstecken sich all diese Gefühle 
 Die in und außerhalb meines Verstandes tanzen 
 Verbrennen alles wonach ich mich ausstrecke 
 Stärken mich in meinem Niedergang 
 Wo bist du? 
 Meine Seele blutet 
 Ich suche verzweifelt 
 bin ich blind? 
 Ganz allein und gebunden für immer 
 In mir gefangen für alle Zeit 
 Mit all diesen namenlosen Gefühlen kann ich in meinem Leben nicht umgehen 
 Mit all diesen gierigen Menschen, die versuchen zu fressen was mir gehört 
 Ihr müsst euren Hunger füllen und aufhören meinen Verstand zu ficken 
 Ich weiß, dass es an der Zeit ist, diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassen 
 Mit all diesen namenlosen Gefühlen kann ich in meinem Leben nicht umgehen 
 Mit all diesen gierigen Menschen, die versuchen zu fressen was mir gehört 
 Ihr müsst euren Hunger füllen und aufhören meinen Verstand zu ficken 
 Ich weiß, dass es an der Zeit ist, diese Orte weit hinter mir zu lassenI'm the one that hurt you 
 I'm the one who cares 
 I'm the one looking down at you 
 I'm the one who's there 
 What do you think I've become 
 What do you think I've become 
 I'm the one looking down on you 
 Where do you go when no one's there? 
 And no one's thereAre you scared? 
 Holding on to sacred places 
 Holding on to what is found 
 I'm looking forward to see their faces 
 Flat on the ground, the horror profound 
 None of you people mean shit to me 
 Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
 Smashed on the ground in your own debris 
 While choking on your blood from the sodomy 
 None of you people mean shit to me 
 Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
 Burn the Obedient, set yourself free 
 Walk the path of secrecy 
 Used to heartless mockery 
 A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes 
 Your misery 
 All the damage it just erases 
 Mediocrity all around 
 The grandiose disorder replaces 
 Conditions of peace, is this my release? 
 None of you people mean shit to me 
 Sadistic little fucking fantasy 
 Smashed on the ground in your own debris 
 While choking on your blood from the sodomy 
 None of you people mean shit to me

 A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes 
 Your miseryMust you keep looking at me 
 Before you looked the other way. 
 Must you keep glaring at me

 You took no pride in me 
 But now I'm your everything

 Not all of your gloating. 
 Must you keep looking at me. 
 Now you see what I am.

 Ich fühle dich überall um mich herum 
 Deine Stimme, sie umringt mich 
 Du erzählst mir weiterhin, was ich hören möchte 
 Du bist wunderbar, 
 So talentiert, 
 Ich brauche dich, 
 Wir haben etwas 
 Falls du jemals etwas brauchst, ich werde da sein 
 In der Angst kann man leben 
 Reiß die Maske von deinem Kopf 
 Zeig mir das wahre Gesicht, das du versteckst 
 Obwohl ich eine Meile von dir entfernt bin, sehe ich dich 
 Du starrst weiterhin, wirkst als wolltest du sagen: 
 Du bist wunderbar, 
 So talentiert, 
 Ich brauche dich, 
 Wir haben etwas

 Anfangs sind sie immer nett 
 Sie schlagen mit ihren Klauen

 Sie schlagen ihre Klauen genau in mich rein 
 Anfangs sind sie immer nett 
 Aber am Ende bin ich der Vollidiot (wörtl. Aber am Ende werde ich immer gefickt)

 Buried so far away 
 Enter my life of nothing 
 Sick of the same ol' thing, 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same ol' thing, 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 I am so high, always 
 Burying my life so slowly 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Can't face bottom without something 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Can't face bottom without something 
 We enter in my head 
 Feeling like I'm God 
 With the world around me 
 Can't you feel this pain?! 
 Reaming through my heart! 
 Screaming through my veins! 
 Nothing I can kill! 
 Screaming a lie! I! Am! 
 Can't you feel my eyes out 
 Can't you take my heart... away 
 To heart 
 Good-byeOh my God, I'm feeling crazy, man 
 What could it be? 
 As I walk into this place everyone's staring at me 
 Somehow I feel I've got a fucked-up disease 
 As I part the seas, fingers come out pointing at me 
 Do I make you laugh? Do you think I'm funny ha ha, or funny queer? 
 Bitch, get outta here 
 Let me make myself clear, I don't give a fuck 
 All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick 
 What's with the hostility, why is it so provoked? 
 You're living in a fantasy, that's how you cope 
 Go ahead, kick the shit out of me, it just fuels the comedy 
 Feel that you're superior, I feel you're just plain absurd 
 Ridiculous vanity that is blurred 
 Go ahead, kick the shit out of me, it just fuels the comedy 
 Oh my God, this shit is crazy, man 
 Look at this scene as I watch these stupid people act like they are machines 
 They should really all drop their knees 
 Oh, the jealousy, that's the one thing I guarantee 
 Do I make you laugh? Do you think I'm funny ha ha, or funny queer shit? 
 Get out of here 
 Let me make myself clear, I don't give a fuck 
 All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick 
 What's with the hostility, why is it so provoked?

 I'm a victim 
 I'm the answer to your prayers 
 I'm a witness 
 On the witch-hunt 
 I'm the monster up the stairs 
 I'm the ghost that's 
 In the mirror 
 I'm everything that you fear 
 I'm the riptide 
 I'm the soul shock 
 I'm the voice that's in your ear 
 I've Seen It All 
 Still can't taste it 
 Smashed to the wall 
 That brought me to my knees 
 I've done it all 
 Fucked-up 
 Wasted 
 Still in my blood 
 But now inside I'm seen 
 I'm the hunted 
 I'm a predator 
 I'm the answer to the riddle 
 I'm the upbeat 
 I'm the headfuck 
 I'm the way off, left to the middle 
 I'm the player 
 I'm the naive 
 I'm the one who's not addicted 
 I'm illogic 
 Turn the fuck-up 
 I'm the broken one who fixed it 
 I've Seen It All 
 Still can't taste it 
 Smashed to the wall 
 That brought me to my knees 
 I've done it all 
 Fucked-up 
 Wasted 
 Still in my blood 
 But now inside I'm seen 
 I've Seen It All 
 Still can't taste it 
 Smashed to the wall 
 That brought me to my knees 
 I've done it all 
 Fucked-up 
 Wasted 
 Still in my blood 
 But now inside I'm seen 
 I'm just a child 
 With the tears in its eyes 
 I am holding this gift 
 That is broken. 
 What do I have left now? 
 I've Seen It All 
 I've done it all 
 I've Seen It All 
 I've done it all 
 I've Seen It All 
 Still can't taste it

 Fucked-up 
 Wasted 
 Still in my blood 
 But now inside I'm seen 
 Now inside I'm seenMother, you're holding my heart, screaming, "Motherfucker" 
 They left me broken, bleeding 
 Son of the man you loved and left for 
 The son of a bitch who tried to show me Death's door 
 Everything's illuminated, everything is dedicated 
 Tried to leave this life I hated, living it was overrated 
 Love song for the dear departed, headstone for the brokenhearted 
 Arms to kill, more flowers to steal 
 Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
 One sip of the blood that I found lying here, I'm dying here 
 Ash and obituaries rain down 
 And suddenly, we're lying naked face down 
 What's it like decapitated? Can't you see me fascinated? 
 You're the only thing I've damaged, only death can be mismanaged 
 Love song for the dear departed, headstone for the brokenhearted 
 Arms to kill, more flowers to steal 
 Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
 One sip of the blood that I found lying here, I'm dying here 
 Don't bring me Daffodils, bring a bouquet of pills 
 Seeds of Geranium, cracked to the cranium 
 Protect me when you can, respect me when I am dying 
 Love song for the dear departed, headstone for the brokenhearted 
 Arms to kill, more flowers to steal 
 Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
 One sip of the blood that I found lying here, I'm dying here 
 Love song for the dear departed 
 (Don't bring me Daffodils, bring a bouquet of pills) 
 Head stone for the brokenhearted 
 (Seeds of Geranium, cracked to the cranium) 
 Arms to kill, more flowers to steal 
 (Protect me when you can, respect me when I am dying) 
 Head trip for the mortal earthbound 
 (Don't bring me Daffodils, bring a bouquet of pills) 
 One sip of the blood that I found

 Lying here, I'm dying here 
 (Protect me when you can, respect me when I am dying)Only see, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming ofsomething I can never be 
 It doesn't matter to me, 'cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all my fantasies. 
 I don't know your (what) name. 
 So what? Let's... 
 Screaming to be the only way that I can truly be free from my fucked-up reality 
 So I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause it's so fun to see my face staring back at me. 
 I don't know your (what) name. 
 So what? Let's ... 
 All day I dream about ...

 There's another dead inside 
 I love you so much I'm never there 
 I'm always with you but never cared 
 And you move in a hostile way 
 Like you're recently wounded 
 I reach for your wrists to feel a pulse 
 You're feeling yourself for both of us 
 We got a problem, it's plain to see 
 We got a problem 
 Which one, which one of you is into me? 
 Which one, which one of me is into you? 
 We're both schizophrenic I fear 
 Say how many voices you hear 
 Which one, which one of you is into me? 
 Which one, which one of me is into you? 
 We are schizophrenic, don't stop 
 No, not till I fuck this all up 
 All the searching we do inside 
 Is a futile attempt to 
 Dissect what we're meant to never know 
 It's all screwed up how the river flows 
 And I know that you tried real hard 
 To center yourself, but 
 Was I the beast that sucked into you? 
 A real dark bitch down inside of you? 
 We got a problem, it's plain to see 
 Bitch, we got a problem 
 Which one, which one of you is into me? 
 Which one, which one of me is into you? 
 We're both schizophrenic I fear

 Everybody was stoned, even the mouse 
 Her from the whore house, me from the jail 
 I just settled down to get a piece of her tail 
 When all of a sudden, I heard such a clatter 
 I tripped on my dick and busted my bladder 
 I went downstairs and what did I see? 
 A fat little red faggot hanging from a tree 
 He stuffed the stockings with reefers and beer 
 And a big fat hairy dick for the family queer 
 That's the end of my story. Funny wasn't it, y'see? 
 One, two, three, four, Santa can suck my dick all dayIn the deepest part of me 
 Like an unknown memory 
 I was never meant to find 
 Little seed of purity 
 And you don't belong to me 
 Still I'm blinded by its light. 
 Don't try to make it right. 
 Does anybody know about love? 
 Does anybody care about God? 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow. 
 Penny for your thoughts I fear 
 We need a little help round here 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow. 
 When the scars don't ever heal 
 Do you fear you'll never feel 
 What it is to be at peace? 
 You're craving a release. 
 Does anybody know about love? 
 Does anybody care about God? 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow. 
 Penny for your thoughts I fear 
 We need a little help round here 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow. 
 I don't understand here 
 Why God would do me this way 
 I lived a life, was always good 
 The one thing I need you take away 
 You take away 
 (The one thing) You take away. 
 (The one thing) You take away. 
 (The one thing) You take away. 
 (The one thing) You take away. 
 Just take away. 
 (The one thing) Take away. 
 One thing to take away. 
 (The one thing) Take away. 
 One thing to take away. 
 Away away. 
 You took away my world 
 And all it left was pain 
 And all this time was for nothing. 
 Does anybody know about love? 
 Does anybody care about God? 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow. 
 Penny for your thoughts I fear 
 We need a little help round here 
 If you're with me, sing sorrow.(

 Bitch!Go 
 I can in every way 
 Mistake the pain I feel inside 
 It comes at me 
 Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind 
 Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind? 
 It runs away 
 It's so predictable 
 I can in every way 
 Feel the stress that tangles up inside 
 Too blind to see 
 Emptiness and the sorrow of their lives 
 You run away 
 To the cover of their pointless ties 
 You ask me 
 It's so predictable 
 I'm gonna try 
 I'm gonna die 
 I'm gonna try 
 Another day 
 Silence overwhelms my mind 
 Who's to say if I have the time or why? 
 Should I pray for all the hate to go away? 
 Another day 
 I can never break free 
 You wait for me 
 I crawl up to you 
 Another day 
 I'll live forever 
 Why should I? 
 I'm gonna try 
 I'm gonna die 
 I'm gonna try 
 Oh 
 Fuck 
 I'm gonna try (should I? 
 I'm gonna try (should I? (oh fuck)

 But I'm gonna die 
 I'm gonna tryI can't bear to face what's growing in my head. 
 Please get away from me. 
 Take advantage of what I feel, yes you do. 
 One day you'll beg for me. 
 So I'm saying nothing. 
 Each day taking that much more. 
 As I'm screaming all my pain, you will be there counting. 
 You just see me as something you throw around. 
 You aren't there for me. 
 Beating down to the ground, yes it always seems. 
 You take more from me (more from me) 
 So I'm saying nothing. 
 Each day taking that much more. 
 As I'm screaming all my pain, you will be there counting. 
 It's funny how it gets started 
 They get their money-grubbing fingers on you 
 They give you money, and the girls, and the fame 
 I only do it for the fun, that's my game

 Please give me some place to hide 
 I'm not trying to go there, so take me away 
 Life sometimes pisses me off 
 It's never a good trip for me 
 Every time I reach for love, it's taken away 
 Night, so I play 
 Give me a sign, this is gay 
 Give me some patience, so I pray 
 It's time to die, is that what I want? 
 There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved 
 Is there something wrong with me? 
 For once in my life I'd like to be really set free 
 Let me be me 
 Night, so I play 
 Give me a sign, this is gay 
 Give me some guidance, so I pray 
 It's time to die, is that what I want?

 When the success started to kick in, life turned into a mess 
 Why can't we still be friends, why judge me for what I am? 
 Can't we go back again? 
 I'm still the same man 
 You figure out really who I am 
 Don't bet your life on that 
 Why can't you see me for what I am? 
 We're human, don't forget that, that 
 Why can't we still be friends, why judge me for what I am? 
 Can't we go back again? 
 I'm still the same man 
 Still around. 
 Don't follow me around. 
 Playin' me like a clown. 
 Facing life not real... not real 
 Life's not real... not real 
 Why can't we still be friends, why judge me for what I am? 
 Can't we go back again? 
 I'm still the same man 
 Same man.Something takes apart of me 
 Something lost and never seen 
 Everytime I start to believe, something's raped and taken from me, from me 
 Life's always gotta be messin with me.

 And the demons, they are creeping around 
 Take me, I am sinking, and my lungs are barely breathing as the angels put me into the ground 
 And everybody's peeking, no one makes a sound 
 The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused 
 Slap me, I am shaking, and my guts are really aching 
 And the demons, they're laughing out loud 
 Spare me, I am fading, and my will is dissipating as the angels put me into the ground. 
 And everybody's peeking, no one makes a sound 
 The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused 
 My mind is debating, these lesions I'm making 
 This mess is sedating, the power embracing 
 The bullshit I'm facing, my feelings, I'm hating 
 Reality is failing, this shit is degrading 
 And everybody's peeking, no one makes a sound 
 The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused 
 The bullshit I'm facing, my feelings, I'm hating 
 Reality, it's failing 
 This shit is degradingWake up, it's almost over 
 Something is taking me 
 Every time I'm up, it kills me 
 With a day to day, shock-waves shatter me 
 I don't beg in security 
 Get up and don't look back now, don't look back now 
 We ride a dying star across a burning sea 
 We're like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me 
 Mass hysteria, mass hysteria 
 Giving up, I won't stop fighting 
 Bring it on, it won't phase me 
 Any time it makes me stronger 
 With a day to day, shock-waves shatter me 
 I don't beg in security 
 Get up and don't look back now, don't look back now 
 We ride a dying star across a burning sea 
 We're like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me 
 Mass hysteria, mass hysteria 
 Going on day to day, stirring up the heavy sorrow 
 Why does life got be this way? 
 Every time I'm up, it kills me 
 Somewhere deep, responding change 
 Manipulation rampant all around 
 Dark all these days, calling on something to follow 
 Mass hysteria 
 (Mass hysteria) 
 We ride a dying star across a burning sea. 
 We're like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me 
 Mass hysteria, mass hysteriaGot to face your fear 
 Lying on the floor 
 Sleep into nothing 
 What the hell am I here for? 
 So come on and play 
 Stab me in my heart 
 So long this time was wasted ripping me apart 
 We are the hurt inside your head 
 Lost in the void of what is dead 
 Constantly twisting things I said 
 Happiness is boring, need pain instead 
 It's starting over 
 Starting over 
 Can't stand, it's over 
 God is gonna take me out 
 My time is over 
 This time is over 
 Why is this over? 
 God is gonna take me out 
 Crawling on the floor 
 All around this space 
 Talking to myself 
 What is this thing I've got to face? 
 Walking through a door 
 Has it been a waste? 
 Going on and on thinking I could find my place 
 We are the hurt inside your head 
 Lost in the void of what is dead 
 Constantly twisting things I said 
 Happiness is boring, need pain instead 
 It's starting over 
 Starting over 
 Can't stand it's over 
 God is gonna take me out 
 My time is over 
 This time is over 
 Why is this over? 
 God is gonna take me out 
 God is gonna take me out 
 God is gonna take me out 
 You can't see 
 I'm torn away from you 
 And everything that's close to me 
 I cannot face the truth 
 It's nothing that I believe 
 Just run away from me 
 And thank me when you're free from me 
 Come take me 
 Come take me 
 Come take me 
 Come take me 
 Come take me 
 We are the hurt inside your head 
 Lost in the void of what is dead 
 Constantly twisting things I said 
 Happiness is boring, need pain instead 
 We are the hurt inside your head 
 Lost in the void of what is dead 
 Constantly twisting things I said 
 Happiness is boring, need pain insteadMichael: Hi, there. Is it okay if I come over and look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart? I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine, and I'm not sure what it is. I want to see what you got on yours. 
 Throttle valve strikes dash-pot rod. The rod must push diaphragm back before it can move back, air must be pushed up in. This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away. The stream will force diaphragm out the air must now vent the dash-pot is ready to work again. 
 Geri: Is this, to this? 
 Michael: I don't care what that... 
 Geri: The rod that they're talking about... 
 Michael: I don't care what that looks like Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is. Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri? 
 Geri: I don't know. 
 Michael: Dash-pot is inside Geri where it's hooked up at... 
 Geri: And that's not made... 
 Michael: And that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke going back and forth. 
 Geri: And that's not the end-loader... 
 Michael: That's just so you can get pure fuel in there. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm. 
 Michael: As soon as you start cranking it over, whoa! 
 You start sucking and when I start sucking this choke here 
 'Cause you can't just have pure fuel you won't light you have to have a little bit of oxygen. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm. 
 Michael: It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this. 
 That's how that works. 
 Geri: That is not what you just said. 
 Michael: I said, no, Geri, the heating is the muthafuckin'...spring! This one here as soon as you start turning over the engine, it's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts. When the vacuum starts, nothing to do with fuckin' heat. Vacuum! 
 Geri: Why are you screaming? 
 Michael: Because the way you said it's supposed to work off heat now, Geri! 
 Geri: You said as the car gradually warms up... 
 Michael: As it gradually warms up, this muthafucker with the coil, the spring opens it up. This has already done it's job, the only thing it's job is to do is when your cranking the engine up after it's been choked, all it does is pull back, then it cracks open just a pinch. 
 Geri: Then you don't know what it's called... 
 Michael: The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm, I mean it's right there in the book. 
 Geri: Sure it is. 
 Michael: Oh, God. You're a hard, hard woman to live with... 
 Geri: If it was right here in the book, I would have found it. 
 Michael: Oh you muthafucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me! 
 Geri: What, Michael? 
 Michael: You showed me the god damn thing in the book what it was called. That's how I knew what it was! 
 Geri: Get out of here and quit yelling at me! 
 Michael: No, Geri, you're fucked! 
 Geri: I haven't seen that in there... 
 Michael: I haven't seen it you stupid son of a bitch... 
 Geri: That vacuum thing? Yes. We don't know what the little business is. It doesn't explain anything. I haven't read anything that explains that. 
 Michael: I told you what it says... 
 Geri: Yeah, you did yes yesterday. 
 Michael: I just told you what it did. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm? 
 Michael: And your sitting there acting like you never saw that before, and yet you're the one who fuckin' showed me it, Geri. 
 Geri: You spin like gas. I told you that fuel filter was not on there. It's not that orange business hanging across the god damn business. 
 Michael: Let's try rebuilding the fuckin' carburetor first Geri. Let me tell you something, Geri. Let me tell you a little secret Geri. 
 Geri: Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet! 
 Michael: Oh, man, I quit! I am fed up! I mean, I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me. I show you something and you 
 still 
 don't fuckin' believe me. 
 Geri: I can't show you anything Michael, because your head is blank. 
 Michael: Well you're sitting there telling me that muthafucker isn't that. Well that's not how it works. Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works. 
 Geri: Who's talking about the truck? We're talking about... 
 Michael: A Dodge Dart, on slant 6. 
 Geri: You have lost your mind. 
 Michael: What are you talking about? 
 Geri: My God!Looking back at yourself

 I'm getting off, I'm getting off to youI like the way you're so fucked up 
 Naked and wearing no makeup 
 I watch your pulse beneath your skin 
 Sometimes I wish I could crawl in 
 I don't care what you talk like 
 I don't care how you dress 
 I don't care 'bout your facial features 
 I couldn't care less 
 I don't need conversation 
 I've got nothing to say 
 I know what you're about 
 I want you 
 Inside out 
 I like the way your 
 ribs 
 contract 
 When you are lying on your back 
 The 
 bruises you internalize 
 eternalize 
 The thoughts behind those crazy eyes 
 I don't care what you talk like 
 I don't care how you dress 
 I don't care 'bout your facial features 
 I couldn't care less 
 I don't need conversation 
 I've got nothing to say 
 I know what you're about 
 I want you 
 Inside out 
 Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art 
 But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart 
 That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you 
 Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard 
 That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you 
 Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard 
 I drink the milk that's in your breast 
 I wouldn't even mind your shit 
 I put my tongue inside your ear 
 I'm gonna eat you up right here 
 I don't care what you talk like 
 I don't care how you dress 
 I don't care 'bout your facial features 
 I couldn't care less

 Everybody's an enemy, tellin' me lies and it's killin' me 
 Why they all want to get rid of me? 
 Everybody's my enemy, several try to disguise the Devil in them 
 Wantin' to get into my cerebellum 
 But I'm ready and willin' to tell them I can't f wit them 
 Excel so hard it got my chest swellin' 
 Like my dick does watchin' naked women do sick stuff on my porn collection on television 
 Nas: 
 Trust nobody, I don't know who to call a friend, they all just pretend to be 
 Fuck everybody, this is to all of y'all, 'cause everybody's an enemy

 Fuck everybody, this is to all of y'all, 'cause everybody's an enemy 
 Nas: 
 Watchin' my own back, strapped with chrome to my homies 
 Where the tombstones at? Where the hoes at? 
 'Cause too many didn't act like dykes, hermaphrodites, with benzene a men 
 Look at the trash they writin', they life and times is kinda wetter 
 Like the life and time of the sandman on Apollo theater 
 Imagine that from the black with a hook who pulls the whack talent off the stage 
 I'm enraged

 You fill your lies around me and you think you've won 
 You feel you can control me, with the things you've done

 Thinking I'm doing the right thing 
 Destroying all that appears before me 
 It was all done in vain 
 Born again through fire 
 Born again through pain 
 Born again with violence 
 Born again with shame 
 Taking this place to call my own 
 Raping my body without a face 
 Tortured, my soul is black as pitch 
 And I have no life to waste 
 Born again through fire 
 Born again through pain 
 Born again with violence 
 Born again with shame 
 I worshiped you 
 Do anything 
 So lost and helpless 
 I played your game 
 I worshiped you 
 Do anything 
 So lost and helpless 
 I played your game 
 Born again through fire 
 Born again through pain 
 Born again with violence 
 Born again with shameWhatcha gonna do? 
 Whatcha gonna feel, when suddenly, I slip away? 
 Almost I am a ghost of who I used to be yesterday 
 How you gonna touch, and how will you collect the beauty 
 When it turns to dust? 
 Everything we make, the cells we generate, are both of us 
 Please be aware that I am you, nothing could be more certain 
 This ain't the time, the place for us to understand this life 
 Hold you in my arms, I hold you in my gaze 
 Save you with my dying breath 
 Underneath this Earth, I'd resurrect your soul, and nothing less 
 Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void 
 An ocean wouldn't hold the love 
 And everything I have, and all I ever was is not enough 
 Please be aware that I am you, nothing could be more certain 
 This ain't the time, the place for us to understand this life 
 I will protect you, I will protect you 
 I will protect you, I will protect you 
 Please be aware that I am you, nothing could be more certain

 I'm trying not to let them out. 
 They tell me to hurt myself.

 Hiding behind the shadows of your broken soul 
 Why is it always you want something you can never have? 
 Why did you try to tempt me? 
 How could you be this way? 
 Your throat I take grasp. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Then your eyes roll back. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Love racing through my veins. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Your heart stops beating. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Black orgasms. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 I kiss your lifeless skin. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 There you are, my precious, with your broken soul 
 Rubbing my crotch elated, taking control 
 Why is it always you fuck up something you have always had? 
 Why did you try to tempt me? 
 How could you be so cold? 
 Your throat I take grasp. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Then your eyes roll back. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Love racing through my veins. (Yes, I feel the pain!) 
 Your heart stops beating. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Black orgasms. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 I kiss your lifeless skin. (Can't you feel the pain?) 
 Here I am, just a man 
 Feeling pain, gives me life 
 Relieving yours is my plan 
 I'd do anything, just to see through your eyes 
 Just to see through your eyes

 But I got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo 
 You kickin' wicked rhymes, picket signs, me and my mob got a truck load of 9's.

 Still got a deuce then I bunny hop the curb. 
 Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin. 
 Gotta phat frown 'cause I'm down, 
 So take a look around 
 All you see is big black boots, 
 Step in, use my steel toe as a weapon 
 And it's awfully quiet, you want to live with this nigga to with a stick 
 Uh, but that's nasty, 'cause I got a Body Count like Ice-T 
 From here to New York I get them skins, and I ain't talkin' about pork 
 Your sly, you pig, dig

 Your picket signs, you know all 
 This funky ass wisdom picket

 'Cause police got equal, hey, A horse is a pig that don't fly straight

 Oh asshole welcome 
 I come say 
 Shit 
 Fuck you! 
 Yeah! 
 What the hell are you talkin' about?Maybe I'm insane walking on a wire 
 Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
 Tell me where to start, think I'm at the end 
 Right now feeling pain, make it go away 
 Maybe I'm to blame, maybe I'm a liar 
 Maybe we're the same, nothing can stop the fire 
 I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
 Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
 These places all I ever think about is lost in time 
 These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
 I'm hiding from the things they say 
 Doing time, been led astray 
 Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
 I'm trying to find a better way, but I'm trapped, can't get away 
 All I think is about yesterday, I could die 
 Maybe I'm insane, walking on a wire 
 Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
 I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
 Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
 These places all I ever think about is lost in time 
 These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
 I'm hiding from the things they say 
 Doing time, been led astray 
 Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
 I'm trying to find a better way, but I'm trapped, can't get away 
 All I think is about yesterday, I could dieThis sunny Sunday is a good day to go 
 Guess you want me to stay, well, let me know

 Why, why, why, hushabye? 
 Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go? 
 Why, why, why, hushabye?

 You say you'd love to but you've lots left to do 
 Almost decided to stay 'cause of you 
 And I hate to tell you to exchange your dreams for one more ticket, no return 
 Why, why, why, hushabye?

 Fred: Say what? Say... what?Lost & alone 
 I'm out of the stone 
 Repeat this process everyday 
 Nothing's my own 
 The dreams that I've grown 
 I won't control & throw away. 
 I need to make the decisions 
 I need to make it right 
 I need to Lead The Parade 
 Or this shit will fucking take my life. 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want to make it right 
 I want to pass this test 
 And complete my tormented life. 
 This curse is my own 
 It follows me home 
 It's like a child that wants to play 
 The thoughts in my brain 
 The subconscious pain 
 Makes me think why do I stay. 
 I need to make the decision 
 I need to make it right 
 I need to Lead The Parade 
 Or this shit will take my life. 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want to make it right 
 I want to pass this test 
 And complete my tormented life. 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want it to be right 
 I want to pass my test 
 And complete this tormented life. 
 I'm happy, everything was wonderful 
 So happy, it's beautiful. 
 I need to make the decision 
 I need to make it right! 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want to make it right 
 I want to pass this test 
 And complete my tormented life. 
 I want to kill the decisions 
 I want to make it right 
 I want to pass this test 
 And complete my tormented life. 
 I'm happy, I knew you'd make it right 
 Everything is wonderful.All the lying and cheating will surely bite you 
 Dishonesty tears you apart and will eat you 
 All the anger and pain and the suffering and the shame and the voices in your brain will surely haunt you 
 Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go 
 I tell you one thing which leads to another thing, then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings 
 Then my brain spins off of fucking everything 
 When this happens, I can't break through 
 All the anger, the pain and the suffering and the shame and the voices in your brain will really haunt you 
 Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go 
 I tell you one thing which leads to another thing, then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings 
 Then my brain spins off of fucking everything 
 When this happens, I can't break through 
 Now we waste our lives away, letting guilt lead the way 
 I'm such a stupid fuck, listening to my head and not my gut 
 Constantly thinking, thinking, thinking 
 And thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking 
 And thinking and thinking and thinking, I'm grieving 
 Now we waste our lives away, letting guilt lead the way 
 I tell you one thing which leads to another thing, then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings 
 Then my brain spins off of fucking everything 
 When this happens, I can't break through 
 I tell you one thing which leads to another thing, then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings 
 Then my brain spins off of fucking everything 
 When this happens, I can't break throughHow come, what's wrong with you? 
 Darling faces all come frowns 
 Let's do what devils do, hang each other when no one's around 
 Why can't I torture you? 
 Giving pain, then you take it away 
 The little things you do, simply, I love your evil ways 
 (Your ways, your ways, your ways) 
 Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology 
 Somehow, you bring the violence out in me 
 I'm just a shell of what I used to be 
 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me 
 This virus follows you 
 Nothing's left, you're dead on the ground 
 How can I covet you? 
 Give you Hell and you can't rebound 
 My soul infected you, blackened thoughts, they run through your head 
 The little things you do, simply, I wish you were dead 
 (Were dead, were dead, were dead) 
 Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology 
 Somehow, you bring the violence out in me 
 I'm just a shell of what I used to be 
 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me 
 (Prey for me) 
 I think I owe you an apology 
 (Prey for me) 
 Somehow you bring the violence out in me

 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me 
 Goodbye, so long, wish I could stay, but everything is all wrong 
 Goodbye, so long, wish I could stay, but everything is all wrong

 I'm just a shell of what I used to be 
 Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for meThere you are alone 
 With no hope of ever having something to be proud of 
 Something earned without begging 
 Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me. 
 Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?! 
 Ball Tongue! 
 You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me.

 Ball Tongue! 
 Congrats you just fucked-up my make-up and shit.

 What have they done for me? 
 Why are you at home buried in your own self pity? 
 Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me? 
 Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me. 
 Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me? 
 Ball Tongue! 
 You have come to take from your buddy. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 You have never been so funky.

 The higgle got sick of me.

 Ball Tongue! 
 Berome's dead at the technodrome. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped. But who was it? 
 Ball Tongue! 
 It doesn't of the rhythm of the damn monger. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 Never die! Never die! 
 Ball Tongue! 
 And then, the man kept kickin' me. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 He gets him on, they're cool. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 He wasn't dead and then they knocked him on the head. 
 Ball Tongue! 
 No more, he's rid of you 
 And you're a dykeHear you calling, hateful darling 
 You're so sweet but you can't stay 
 Won't be easy 'cause you please me 
 Lifeless doll dressed up to play 
 Don't make something out of nothing 
 Till your dreams just slip away 
 Careful with me doesn't fit me 
 Just pretend for one more day 
 All along I thought I was wrong 
 Also it's screamed across the room 
 All along I feel it's strong 
 I feel it calling, calling me too soon 
 Every time I'm hearing whining 
 Drive this ghost away from me 
 Playful sinner wants me in her 
 Can't you stay away from me? 
 It's good headache, little fumblings 
 Like a message played for me 
 Hurt me tender, one last bender 
 Going down so gratefully 
 All along I thought I was wrong 
 Also it's screamed across the room 
 All along I feel it's strong 
 I feel it calling, calling me too soon 
 I don't need you 
 What the fuck you're here for? 
 Slam my fist against the door 
 Oh no, don't go 
 I'm gonna break it down 
 All of me is tied and torn 
 I don't need, no 
 Is there right or wrong? 
 Crush the day when I was born 
 I don't need you 
 What the fuck's it for? 
 Slam my fist against the door 
 All along I thought I was wrong 
 Also it's screamed across the room 
 All along I feel it's strong 
 I feel it calling me too soon 
 All along I thought I was wrong 
 Also it's screamed across the room 
 All along I feel it's strong 
 (Calling me too soon) 
 I don't need you 
 I don't need youLately things won't go my way 
 Lately everything is gray 
 It feels like something 
 It feels like... nothing. 
 So I came too far 
 To end up this way 
 Feeling like I'm gone 
 Feeling there's No Way. 
 So I'm angry fuck today 
 Anger's an only thing I've made 
 It feels like something 
 No it's... nothing. 
 So I came too far 
 To end up this way 
 Feeling like I'm gone 
 Feeling there's No Way. 
 To live this way. 
 Hating, fearing, falling 
 To the place where people haunt me 
 I can't help but keep from falling 
 To the place where people call me 
 I can't wait to give them these feelings of hating 
 Keeping inside me for all to take 
 Picking at me 
 They're ripping at me 
 Ripping at me. 
 So I came too far 
 To end up this way 
 Feeling like I'm gone 
 Feeling there's No Way. 
 So I came too far 
 To end up this way 
 Feeling like I'm gone 
 Feeling there's No Way. 
 Hating, fearing, falling 
 To the place where people haunt me 
 I can't help but keep from falling 
 To the place where people call me! 
 To live this way. 
 Live this way.Don't wanna be sly and defile you 
 Desecrate my mind and rely on you 
 I just wanna break this crown 
 But it's hard when I'm so run down 
 And you're so cynical, narcissistic cannibal 
 Got to bring myself back from the dead 
 Sometimes I hate the life I made 
 Everything's wrong every time 
 Pushing on, I can't escape 
 Everything that comes my way 
 Is haunting me, taking its sweet time 
 Holding on, I'm lost in a haze 
 Fighting life to the end of my days 
 Don't wanna be rude but I have to 
 Nothing's good about the hell you've put me through 
 I just need to look around 
 See that life that has come unbound 
 And you're so cynical, narcissistic cannibal 
 Got to bring myself back from the dead 
 Sometimes I hate the life I made 
 Everything's wrong every time 
 Pushing on, I can't escape 
 Everything that comes my way 
 Is haunting me, taking its sweet time 
 Sometimes I hate the life I made 
 Everything's wrong every time 
 Pushing on, I can't escape 
 Everything that comes my way 
 Is haunting me, taking its sweet time 
 Holding on, I'm lost in a haze 
 Fighting life to the end of my days 
 Holding on, I'm lost in a haze 
 Fighting life to the end of my daysI dream of the past so I can break through 
 The walls I have built inside 
 The thoughts I can't grasp, transparent, see through 
 They constantly fight and collide 
 I'd love to see a different world 
 A place where you can't find me 
 Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
 Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
 Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face, my friend 
 (My friend) 
 This ain't the end 
 (The end) 
 Why can't I relax and let it be true? 
 This world that I try to hide 
 It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you 
 This place makes me feel alive 
 I'd love to see a different world 
 A place where you can't find me 
 Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
 Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
 Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face, my friend 
 (My friend) 
 This ain't the end 
 (The end) 
 The call of the purpose is the change in behaviour 
 And that is all we can sense of the strangers 
 It gets on top of you and forces your perspective 
 Then you know it, can feel it, it's as dark as you can get 
 You want it harder, harder, harder 
 Give it to you harder, harder 
 You just want it harder, harder, harder 
 Give it to you harder, harder 
 I don't think you'll ever get it 
 Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall 
 Your magic spell doesn't work anymore 
 Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face, my friend 
 (My friend) 
 This ain't the end 
 (The end)I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation 
 There's so much ---- around me 
 Such a lack of compassion 
 I thought it would be fun and games 
 It would be fun and games 
 Instead, It's all the same 
 It's all the same 
 I want something to do 
 Need to feel the sickness in you 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flush made me bad 
 All I do is look for you 
 I need my fix, you need it too 
 Just to get some sort of attention, attention 
 What does that mean to you? 
 What does it mean to you? 
 For me, It's something I just do 
 I just do 
 I want something 
 I need to feel the sickness in you 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flush made me bad 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flush made me bad 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flush made me bad 
 Does it make me bad? 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again 
 Does it make me bad? 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flush made me bad 
 Does it make me bad? 
 Does it make me bad? 
 Does it make me bad? 
 Does it make me bad?I'm walking on a razor blade 
 Careful not to cross the line 
 Every little step I take 
 It's punishment time 
 Now I'm getting to the end of the blade 
 Slipping to the other side 
 Every little step I take 
 It's punishment time 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 I'm hanging like a bat today 
 Crucified by design 
 Every little move I make 
 It's punishment time 
 Now I'm sleeping on a bed of nails 
 They're breaking through one at a time 
 Cause every little move I make 
 The punishment's mine 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 I give and don't get 
 I try to my death 
 For something inside me 
 That makes me forget [x4] 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Fighting to survive 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no tomorrow 
 Heavy on the heart 
 There's no today 
 Fight or flight 
 I'm losing my mind 
 Losing my mind! (x6)Close your eyes, fall asleep 
 Broken promises that you never keep 
 Drift away tonight, just drift away tonight 
 We used to dream, we used to laugh 
 No one could tell us that this would never last 
 This ain't a love song, I would never give you one 
 No more secrets, no more lies 
 No more feelings or surprise 
 No more whispered words or lullabies 
 Go fuck your lies 
 Everything, everything falls with us 
 Everything, everything always does 
 Everything, everything falls all apart 
 I've given up, it's all I could take 
 My hands are shaking, my body could break 
 I will be lonely now, come on and take me out 
 I used to care, I used to try 
 But what's the use; it always ends with goodbye 
 This ain't a love song, I'd never give you one 
 No more secrets, no more lies 
 No more feelings or surprise 
 No more whispered words or lullabies 
 Go fuck your lies 
 Everything, everything falls with us 
 Everything, everything always does 
 Everything, everything falls all apart

 Your voice, it surrounds me 
 You keep telling me what I want to hear

 I cannot maintain as the shit gnaws out of my brain 
 I wish you could be me, and then yes you would see 
 How tired I am and how you get the best of me 
 At least you could look at me while you're raping me 
 You are taking my life and selling it 
 Why should I complain? At least it helps my pain 
 I am very cool now and it doesn't blot my fame 
 I am going insane; this shit is all of a pain 
 I cannot maintain as the shit gnaws out of my brain 
 I wish you could be me, and then yes you would see

 You fuckin' pussy!All alone and coming down as my tears create a sea 
 Have I been awake so long that the devil's nesting for me? 
 Right now if you could see, right now attacking me 
 Hold on desperately, you'll never get to me 
 Take a look around, help me 
 I see this loser little face staring at me 
 Run away, diseased and torn, the depression's ecstasy 
 Have I been away so long that the devil's coming for me? 
 Right now if you could see, right now attacking me 
 Hold on desperately, you'll never get to me 
 Take a look around, help me 
 I see this loser little face staring at me

 They are coming 
 They are coming 
 They are coming 
 They are comingDisgraced, expendable, we are not really real 
 A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade 
 Spewing bile atrocities, bringing existence to its knees 
 I will manifest my sins and I will kill mercy within 
 Immersed in this hypnotic spell, influenced by the hate that swells 
 I'm not terrified anymore, there's nothing left but open sores 
 Disengaged, relinquish the reality I've known 
 I'm feeling like I'm alienated from my own and I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade 
 Spewing bile atrocities, bringing existence to its knees 
 I will manifest my sins and I will kill mercy within 
 Immersed in this hypnotic spell, influenced by the hate that swells 
 I'm not terrified anymore, there's nothing left but open sores 
 Spewing bile atrocities, bringing existence to its knees 
 I will manifest my sins and I will kill mercy within 
 Immersed in this hypnotic spell, influenced by the hate that swells 
 I'm not terrified anymore, there's nothing left but open sores 
 Nothing left but open soresI 
 I am confused 
 Fighting myself 
 Wanting to give in 
 Needing your help 
 Skin cold with fear 
 Feel it when we touch 
 Outside I don't know you 
 But inside I'm fine 
 Can you see it in me? 
 Skin cold from touch 
 Each day confronted with what I have done 
 You pull me closer 
 I push you away 
 You tell me it's okay 
 I can't help but feel the pain 
 I hate you 
 Why are you taken? 
 I love you 
 I feel so helpless 
 Why is it you? 
 Ripping my insides each time I lay with you

 Bitch"Hey you, hey you, devil's little sister 
 Listening to your twisted transistor 
 Hold it between your legs, turn it up! Turn it up! 
 Low end is coming through, can't get enough. 
 A lonely life where no one understands you 
 But don't give up, because the music do. 
 Music do, music do, music do, music do 
 Music do, music do. 
 Because the music do, and it is reaching 
 Inside you, forever preaching 
 Forget you, your scream's a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor. 
 Hey you, hey you, finally you get it 
 The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it 
 And as your tears fall on your dress, your dress 
 Vibrations coming through, you're in a mess. 
 A lonely life where no one understands you 
 But don't give up, because the music do. 
 Music do, music do, music do, music do 
 Music do, music do. 
 Because the music do, and it is reaching 
 Inside you, forever preaching 
 Forget you, your scream's a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor.

 Music do, music do. 
 Music do, music do. 
 Music do, music do. 
 Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit 
 This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt 
 Says who, says who? Anesthetize this bitch! 
 A-nes-the-tize this bitch, anesthetize! 
 Just let me be, between you and me, don't fit! 
 Fit! 
 ...Music do, and it is reaching 
 Inside you, forever preaching 
 Forget you, your scream's a whisper 
 Hang on you twisted transistor."We are the pain, we are the shame 
 We've gone insane inside, where no one's around 
 I am to blame for everything 
 I like this game that you all make me play 
 I'm done, being there for others, they have their pain and so do I 
 Don't need to feel it all over, I try to hold on and you bring me down 
 We are the strange, we are deranged 
 I can't explain how you all break me apart 
 I am to blame for everything 
 I like this game that you all make me play 
 I'm done, being there for others, they have their pain and so do I 
 Don't need to feel it all over, I try to hold on and you bring me down 
 We wait, we hate, we try to get away 
 Mistake my pain, it has been lead astray 
 I'm looking around, I drop to the ground 
 Why does it have to end this way? 
 Feeling numb, so long 
 Oh, God, it's just everything, it's everything 
 Now I pray for all of them to go away! 
 I'm done, being there for others, they have their pain and so do I 
 Don't need to feel it all over, I try to hold on and you bring me downI see your faces and I do not understand why 
 Each time I dream you're standing there right by my side. 
 Why do you make me? 
 You take my pride 
 And in my eyes, 
 You kinda rape me inside. 
 I have no place to run and hide. 
 I have no place to hide, which I like. 
 Some will look at the time I looked back into my life. 
 You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes. 
 Why do you make me? 
 Remember my hate, all this shame? 
 Don't you hate me sometimes? 
 I have no place to run or hide. 
 I have no place to hide, which I like.

 Disgusting right to the end 
 Didn't I know it then? 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 You're basic but hard to define 
 Simple yet somehow sublime 
 Know you will strike again 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song 
 Yeah, that's all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will ever be 
 Polished, you shimmer when shined, but rotten and seething inside 
 Everyone falls for this 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song 
 Yeah, that's all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will, it's all that you will, it's all that you will ever be 
 Ever be, never be, want to be mine 
 All to be, made to be, holding your side 
 Throwing it, breaking it over your grave 
 Sending you back to the place you once came 
 It would be hard to be you, knowing the right thing to do 
 You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song 
 Yeah, that's all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will ever be 
 Ever be, never be, wannabe 
 Ever be, never be, wannabe 
 Ever be, never be, wannabe 
 Ever be, never be, wannabe 
 You will never be, you will never be, you will never be

 It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone 
 (Gone) 
 It's all gone, it's all gone 
 Ever be, never be, wannabeWhat's your lie? 
 Warm lips, a big smile, has made your mind runs wild, 
 This game you play I like the way 
 You expect to grab a child, 
 You think I'm innocent, 
 Not wild, 
 Take me and look see how much I'm tame 
 Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
 How to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
 I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
 So let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear 
 Warm lips, a big smile, hatred runs through your insides, 
 This game you play it turns my attention each day 
 You think it's all a lie, they want you to stray outta line, 
 Anger twisted your life, but you pay 
 I wish I could take 
 Control, 
 I wish I could let go, 
 I wish I could break this mold, 
 Inside I'm so fucking cold 
 I'm come'n

 Warm lips, a big smile, has made your mind runs wild, 
 This game you play I like the way 
 You expect to grab a child, 
 You think I'm innocent, 
 Not wild, 
 Take me and look see how much I'm tame 
 Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
 How to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
 I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
 So let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear 
 I wish I could lose control

 Take away the only love inside you

 And you're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine 
 Tell me why you never liked me 
 Tell me once that you'll fight me 
 Pull down and wait for the perfect time 
 To take what's rightfully mine 
 You think they're dumb to defy me 
 You said you don't, but defy me 
 You wait, you don't want anyone 
 Oh well

 Well, I don't know,  I just feel the craving

 These little girls, they make me feel so goddamn exhilarated

 Man from the whore house

 To get a piece of her tail 
 When all of a sudden 
 I heard such a clatter 
 I tripped on my dick 
 And busted my bladder! 
 I went downstairs 
 And what did I see? 
 A fat little red faggot 
 Hangin' from a tree 
 He stuffed the stockings 
 With reefers and beer 
 And a big fat hairy dick 
 For the family queer 
 That's the end of my story 
 Funny wasn't it, ya see?

 Man, I got to let it out 
 Am I crazy? 
 Screaming, nothing ever comes out 
 I keep feeling lost 
 I'll never find my way out 
 I'm not thinking 
 This unless the truth will pour out 
 Give me some courage 
 Beating me down now for some time 
 Are you laughing 
 Am I funny 
 I hate and slide 
 I'll take this time to let out what's inside 
 'Cause I will break 
 Sometimes I wish you'd die 
 Full of sorrow 
 You raped and stole my pride 
 And all this hate is bottled up inside 
 My heart's breaking 
 Man you really ripped it out 
 You take pleasure 
 Watching as I claw my way out 
 The hurt rising 
 Soon it's gonna tear my soul out 
 It's not closure 
 Feeling like I'm on my way out 
 Give me some courage 
 Beating me down now for some time 
 Are you laughing 
 Am I funny? 
 I hate and slide 
 I'll take this time 
 To let out what's inside 
 'Cause I will break 
 Sometimes I wish you'd die 
 Full of sorrow 
 You raped and stole my pride 
 And all this hate is bottled up inside 
 Feeling the hate as they cut down my spine 
 Peeling your flesh like the way you've cut mine 
 Do you feel happy 
 You fucked up my mind 
 You're going to pay this time 
 I'll take this time 
 To let out what's inside 
 'Cause I will break 
 Sometimes I wish you'd die 
 Full of sorrow 
 You raped and stole my pride 
 And all this hate is bottled up insideI know it's not like me to hold back but this time I knew

 Why can't you just shut your face? 
 Oh, God, the feelings I feel would get me thrown in a cage 
 You're the one that's always screaming at me 
 I'm the one that keeps your life so care free 
 What the fuck more do you want me to be? 
 Why must you do this to me? 
 Run away, I can't stay

 Counting on me, always hoping I'll be there for all of your problems

 Cut the cord, from this day forward, we'll be drifting 
 No direction, no affection, watch the soul dive 
 You're dissected, resurrected, still don't know why 
 This illness is like a monster that is eating us alive 
 Hold on, be strong 
 So right, so wrong 
 With all of our senses, all of our defenses, hold on, be strong 
 New arrival, our survival, still not certain 
 What's a virtue? Where'd you go to when you're hurting? 
 It's a weakness, it's a sickness in the gene pool 
 Show no mercy, people here say, "Kill the damn fool" 
 This illness is like a monster that is eating us alive 
 Hold on, be strong 
 So right, so wrong 
 With all of our senses, all of our defenses, hold on, be strong 
 My soul, blood, run 
 Don't ever let me go, no 
 Don't ever let me go, no 
 And I'll never let you go, no 
 I'll never let you go, no 
 Hold on, be strong 
 So right, so wrong 
 With all of our senses, all of our defenses, hold on, be strongMichael: Hi, there. 
 Uh, Is it okay if I come over and take a look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart? 
 I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine & I'm not sure what it is. 
 I want to see what you got on yours. 
 Throttle valve strikes dash-pot rod. 
 The rod must push diaphragm back before it can move back, air must be pushed up in. 
 This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away. 
 The stream will force diaphragm out the air must now vent the dash-pot is ready to work again. 
 Geri: Is this, to this? 
 Michael: I don't care what that... 
 Geri: The rod that they're talking about... 
 Michael: I don't care what that looks like Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is. Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri? 
 Geri: I don't know. 
 Michael: Dash-pot is inside Geri where it's hooked up at... 
 Geri: And that's not made... 
 Michael: And that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back and forth. 
 Geri: And that's not the end-loader... 
 Michael: That's just so you can get pure fuel in there. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm. 
 Michael: As soon as you start cranking it over, whoa! 
 Deep now deep. You start sucking and when I start sucking this choke here 
 'Cause you can't just have pure fuel you won't light you have to have a little bit of oxygen. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm. 
 Michael: It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this. 
 That's how that works. 
 Geri: That is not what you just said. 
 Michael: I said 
 no, Geri, the heating is the muthafuckin'...spring! 
 This one here as soon as you start turnin' over the engine, it's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts. 
 When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat. Vacuum! 
 Geri: Why are you screaming? 
 Michael: Because the way you said it's supposed to work off heat no, Geri! 
 Geri: You said as the car gradually warms up... 
 Michael: As it gradually warms up, this muthafucker with the coil, the spring opens it up. 
 This has already done it's job, the only thing it's job is to do is when your cranking the engine up after it's been choked, all it does is pull back, then it cracks open just a pinch. 
 Geri: Then you don't know what it's called... 
 Michael: The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm, I mean it's right there in the book. 
 Geri: Sure it is. 
 Michael: Oh God. You're a hard, hard woman to live with... 
 Geri: If it was right here in the book, I would have found it. 
 Michael: Oh you muthafucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me! 
 Geri: What? 
 Michael: You showed me the god damn thing in the book what it was called. That's what I knew what it was! 
 Geri: Get out of here and quit yelling at me! 
 Michael: No, Geri, your fucked! 
 Geri: I haven't seen that in there... 
 Michael: I haven't seen it you stupid son of a bitch... 
 Geri: That vacuum thing? Yes. 
 We don't know what the little business is. 
 It doesn't explain anything. 
 I haven't read anything that explains that. 
 Michael: I told you what it says... 
 Geri: Yeah, you did yes, yesterday. 
 Michael: I just told you what it did. 
 Geri: Mm-hmm? 
 Michael: & your sittin' there saying you never saw that before and yet your the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri. 
 Geri: You stink like gas. 
 I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there. 
 It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the god damn business. 
 Michael: Let's try rebuilding the fuckin' carburetor first Geri. 
 Let me tell you something, Geri. 
 Let me tell you a little secret Geri. 
 Geri: Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet! 
 Michael: Oh, man, I quit! I am fed up! I mean, I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me. 
 You show me something and you 
 still 
 don't fuckin' believe me. 
 Geri: I can't show you anything Michael, because your head is blank. 
 Michael: Well your sittin' there tellin' me that muthafucker isn't that. 
 Well that's not how it works. 
 Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works. 
 Geri: Who's talking about the truck? We're talkin' about... 
 Michael: A Dodge Dart, on slant 6. 
 Geri: You have lost your mind. 
 Michael: What are you talkin' about? 
 Geri: My God!Oh 
 Oh, yo, pretty ladies around the world, got a weird thing to show you 
 So tell all the boys and girls, tell your brother, your sister and your mama too 
 We're about to go down, and you'll know just what to do 
 Wave your hands in the air like you don't care 
 Glide by the people as they start to look and stare 
 Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama 
 Come on, baby, tell me what's the word 
 Word up 
 (Up, up) 
 Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway 
 Word up 
 (Up, up) 
 It's the code word 
 No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard 
 Now all you sucker D.J.'s who think you're fly 
 There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why 
 You try to put on those Airs and act real cool 
 But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools 
 If there's music we can use it, be free to dance 
 We don't have the time for psychological romance 
 No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama 
 Come on, baby, tell me what's the word 
 The word up

 OhWoke up, didn't choke up 
 Saw my AK, it was broke up 
 Put it together like a jigsaw 
 Got my 9 and my rambo knife off the floor 
 Went to the bathroom and beat the rush 
 "Yo who the fuck used my toothbrush?" 
 Went to my sisters room, "Yo bitch wake up" 
 "You stupid ass, dirty ass nasty ass slut." 
 Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh, 
 Kicked her in the pussy, and punched her in the eye 
 Slapped her in the head, stepped on her cord, 
 Don't fuck around bitch word is bond. 
 Went downstairs to eat with my folks 
 "Ma... you broke the fuckin' egg yolk" 
 Punched her in the chest, got on her cheek 
 Then I made her scream like the bitch was a thief 
 Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull 
 AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple 
 Pops' got mad 'cause Mom got licked 
 I didn't give a fuck so I shot 'em in the dick 
 Hungry ass fuck, said my grace 
 Pop kept screamin' so I shot him in the face 
 Ate my food found my coat 
 Mail man came so I cut his mutha-fuckin' throat 
 Waiting for the mutha-fuckin' school bus... 
 I had a dream that I was hard...Precious fingers, she knows how to hold the poison 
 Lick it, dip it, and for no particular reason 
 She crawls on the floor 
 Slides against door 
 Precious finger shows her blossom is in season 
 Doesn't matter, she'll be doin' it her way 
 Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way 
 Doesn't matter, she'll be doin' it her way 
 Every night, every day 
 I never meant to show up here anyway 
 I'm only fuckin' you till the seasons change 
 Treasured deep between the places that you hold dear 
 Tempted her to act as if we are in love here 
 Lying across this chair 
 Fingers everywhere 
 Terrifying all the angels up above here 
 Doesn't matter, she'll be doin' it her way 
 Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way 
 Doesn't matter, she'll be doin' it her way 
 Every night, every day 
 I never meant to show up here anyway 
 I'm only fuckin' you till the seasons change 
 When you come be a good girl 
 Hold your breath make it last long 
 It is called 
 Death 
 The little death, girl 
 I never meant to show up here anyway 
 I'm only fuckin' you till the seasons change 
 I never meant to show up here anyway 
 I'm only fuckin' you till the seasons change.Sick of all these things I tried, sick of all these lies

 Buried so far away 
 Enter my life of nothing 
 Sick of the same ol' thing, 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 Sick of the same ol' thing, 
 So I dig a hole, bury pain! 
 I am so high, always 
 Burying my life so slowly 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Can't face bottom without something 
 It opens my mind to feelings 
 Can't face bottom without something 
 We enter in my head 
 Feeling like I'm God 
 With the world around me 
 Can't you feel this pain?! 
 Reaming through my heart! 
 Screaming through my veins! 
 Nothing I can kill! 
 Screaming a lie! I! Am! 
 Can't you feel my eyes out 
 Can't you take my heart... away 
 To heart 
 Good-byeComing onto you 
 The hell you got me through 
 What would I have to do to kiss that frown 
 I know what's wrong with you 
 That fucked up part of you 
 Is gonna bury me under ground 
 Now I'm awake 
 Been stuck in a place I really hate 
 And it's not fate 
 Everything's just fine 
 So why must it be 
 Chaos Lives in Everything 
 Trapped inside a dream 
 It all comes back to me 
 Get away from you 
 Is what I gotta do 
 I want my soul back, I'll stand my ground 
 So walk away from me 
 You know this has to be 
 Another way for me to kiss that frown 
 And it's not fate 
 Everything's just fine 
 So why must it be 
 Chaos Lives in Everything 
 Trapped inside a dream 
 It all comes back to me 
 Now I'm guilty, not ashamed 
 Got this thing attached to me, throw it all away 
 It just comes back to me 
 Gonna take you 
 Gonna break you 
 Gonna rape you, fuck you bitch, frown 
 Sometimes I worry 
 Sometimes I'm sorry 
 Sometimes I just want to beat you down 
 Gonna take you 
 Gonna break you 
 Gonna rape you, fuck you bitch, frown 
 Sometimes I worry 
 Sometimes I'm sorry 
 Sometimes I just want to kiss that frown 
 I'm insane but now you gotta give it up to me 
 Life is wearing thin 
 My only pleasure is watching you give in 
 I tried 
 To pretend 
 All it got me was nothing in the end 
 I tried 
 To win 
 All it got me was nothing in the end 
 So why must it be 
 Chaos Lives in Everything 
 Trapped inside a dream 
 It all comes back to me 
 Now I'm guilty, not ashamed 
 Got this thing attached to me, throw it all away 
 It just comes back to me 
 It just comes back to me 
 It just comes back to meI'm thanking all, thanking all the fucked people 
 Thanking all the shit I love 
 They are all the things I've made 
 Straight from my heart, begging all the same people 
 Burning is the same evil, somehow making me feel sane 
 Waiting all this time, I've got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my mind I can see before I'm gone 
 Sometimes, I feel it chasing me, all the hate that's breaking me 
 I realize I'm taking everything, and the shit seems to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me to a place I hate to be 
 All along I seem to make believe, and the shit seems to follow 
 I'm thinking of making all the fucked people 
 Making the bitches I love 
 Make them die and go away 
 Pain from the start, all my dreams are ripped apart 
 Thanking all the fucked people, they are all the things I've saved 
 Waiting all this time, I've got nothing to hold on 
 But the faces of my mind I can see before I'm gone 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me, all the hate that's breaking me 
 I realize I'm taking everything, and the shit seems to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me to a place I'm meant to be 
 All along I seem to make believe, and the shit seems to follow 
 Your life, I hate 
 Oh, God, can I replay? 
 Stop and help me 
 Sometimes I feel it chasing me, all the hate that's breaking me 
 I realize I'm taking everything, and the shit seems to follow 
 This time I feel it taking me to a place I'm meant to be 
 All along I seem to make believe, and the shit seems to follow 
 This shit seems to follow, this shit seems to follow 
 This shit seems to follow, this shit seems to followFuck all that bullshit! 
 You watch me play 
 I look away 
 Your lights turn bright 
 You found the light 
 Take off in space. You and I. 
 Take off in space. You and I. 
 You're gonna die! 
 Wanna meet me, why? 
 I wish I had your strength 
 Inside your soul escapes 
 Take off in space. You and I. 
 Take off in space. You and I. 
 Cry into me 
 Give me something, all right 
 The kids that die listening to me 
 You are alive! 
 Take off in space. You and I. 
 Take off in space. You and I.Away, I see it's going down 
 Today, hoping in time 
 We'll bury all this pain 
 And we'll awake something inside 
 We push our buttons far inside 
 We tear our hearts out 
 Then we fight 
 Hey, I know 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 I cannot survive alone 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 Our lives, were good in every way 
 Too late, time after time 
 Our love just turned to hate 
 But we stay by each other's side 
 We push our buttons far inside 
 We tear our hearts out 
 Then we fight 
 Hey, I know 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 I cannot survive alone 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 I keep holding on 
 I feel I'm where I belong 
 Every time we fight, it feels so wrong 
 I feel so enslaved by my pride 
 Then we meet again 
 We push our buttons far inside 
 We tear our hearts out 
 Then we fight 
 Hey, I know 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've known 
 I cannot survive alone 
 Feels like I've lost everything that I've knownDay after day it's the same 
 Why do we play these games? 
 Reaching out for something true 
 Questioning all that I do 
 Gotta get back, gotta get back 
 Never gonna be the same 'cause I covered my tracks 
 Name of the game, feel the pain 
 Look into my eyes and you'll see no pain 
 Everything will come right back to you 
 Everything you put me through 
 I can't breathe 
 Will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My body's weakness 
 I can't breathe 
 Get out before it's too late 
 You know it's pulling me down 
 Why do I feel so alone? 
 So close, yet so far from home 
 One thing I know I believe 
 On until after they bleed 
 Sin is through, sin is through 
 Coming on to me while I'm coming on to you 
 Never look away, never look away 
 Cause once you slip you're out of my way 
 Practice this one thing I say 
 Never let this get away from me 
 I can't breathe 
 Will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My body's weakness 
 I can't breathe 
 Get out before it's too late 
 I can't breathe will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My body's weakness 
 I can't breathe 
 Get out before it's too late 
 You know it's pulling me down [x9] 
 Never give up, never give up 
 Never turn away or I'll be fucking you up [x2] 
 Gotta get back, gotta get back 
 Never gonna be the same 'cause I covered my tracks 
 Feel the pain, feel the pain 
 I don't need a mask to see your pain 
 Sin is through, sin is through 
 You're coming on to me while I'm coming on to you 
 Never look away, never look away 
 Once you slip you're out of my way 
 I can't breathe will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My body's weakness 
 I can't breathe 
 Get out before it's too late 
 You know it's pulling me down 
 I can't breathe 
 Will someone see me 
 Suffocate 
 My body's weakness 
 I can't breathe 
 Get out before it's too late 
 You know it's pulling me downSome deny & search for things that never come around. 
 Do I feel like a fool? 
 The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared 
 And I owe this all to you. 
 I'm feeling like I'm sinking 
 And nothing's there to catch me 
 Keep me breathing. 
 What do I have to do? 
 Why can't this hurt be through? 
 I'm going head onto 
 Something I know I will fail. 
 Why can't this Kiss be true? 
 Why won't you please let me through? 
 I don't understand why you always push me away. 
 Well, last thing I would like to do before I go away 
 Is cry there next to you. 
 Cry & talk about the good old days & where they've gone 
 And now how much I hate you. 
 What do I have to do? 
 Why can't this hurt be through? 
 I'm going head onto 
 Something I know I will fail. 
 Why can't this Kiss be true? 
 Why won't you please let me through? 
 I don't understand why you always push me away. 
 I feel the blood drip off my body as it pools right there on the ground. 
 What am I now? 
 What am I now? 
 What am I now? 
 What do I have to do? 
 Why can't this hurt be through? 
 I'm going head onto 
 Something I know I will fail. 
 Why can't this Kiss be true? 
 Why won't you please let me through? 
 I don't understand why you always push me away. 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away? 
 Why you always push me away?Feeling out of place 
 Something must be wrong 
 Emotions in my space 
 Tight grip holding on. 
 I can't control the events around me 
 I can't console the stress inside me 
 And once I turn off my brain 
 I realize I am alive. 
 I want you to see 
 I'm trying to please 
 Everyone around me 
 I'm down on my knees 
 The stress makes me bleed 
 It feels like they're all stabbing me. 
 Feeling out of place. 
 Why must I hold on? 
 Anger I can taste 
 ?Time itself? is gone. 
 I can't control the events around me 
 I can't console the stress inside me 
 And once I turn off my brain 
 I realize I am alive. 
 I want you to see 
 I'm trying to please 
 Everyone around me 
 I'm down on my knees 
 The stress makes me bleed 
 It feels like they're all stabbing me. 
 You know. You know. 
 What the fuck do you want from me? 
 I am just a human being 
 Living my life to please everyone 
 I can't do this anymore 
 Being everybody's whore! 
 Being everybody's whore! 
 Being everybody's whore! 
 Being everybody's whore! 
 For once, I'm gonna stand up and please me! 
 I want you to see 
 I'm trying to please 
 Everyone around me 
 I'm down on my knees 
 The stress makes me bleed 
 It feels like they're all stabbing me. 
 ... Being everybody's whore... 
 ... Being everybody's whore... 
 ... Being everybody's whore... 
 Being everybody's whore!My brother, you love her, but don't give up your instincts 
 Hang onto, you know what, they'll be gone fast as you blink 
 They're trained to seduce you, suck you dry quick as they can 
 They tried to reduce you, now you're barely a man 
 Oh, my God, how can you deny the flood that's flowing through you? 
 Hey, you, you're saying that she's all that you desire, liar 
 Hey, you, you think you can throw water on this fire? 
 Liar 
 It's not wrong to let go and let the woman ride you 
 For fuck sake, don't lose touch with the dog that's inside you 
 She wanted what you had, you bet she smelt the spore 
 Don't whimp up, fuck her up 
 One more time, slam that door 
 Oh, my God, how can you deny the flood that's flowing through you? 
 Hey, you, you're saying that she's all that you desire, liar 
 Hey, you, you think you can throw water on this fire? 
 Liar 
 Oh, my God, how can you deny the flood that's flowing through you? 
 Hey, you, you're saying that she's all that you desire, liar 
 Hey, you, you think you can throw water on this fire? 
 Liar 
 Liar, liar, liar, liar 
 Oh, my God, how can you deny the flood that's flowing through you?Let's go 
 What's the problem, why can't you relax? 
 Inside, hating on everything that makes me mad 
 Love is scary and love is to blame 
 Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame because I'm over you 
 Over you, over you, over you, over you, over you, over you, let's go 
 I'm taking over, I won't be lead astray 
 Life doesn't last long, I gotta get away 
 The solution I try to reveal, but the question is how can you really be healed? 
 Hate is scary and hate is to blame 
 God, I need you and that is a shame because I need you 
 I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, let's go 
 I'm taking over, I won't be lead astray

 Gotta get away, can't, can't get away, let's go 
 I'm taking over, I won't be lead astray 
 Life doesn't last long, I gotta get away 
 I'm taking over, I won't be lead astray 
 Life doesn't last long, I gotta get awayHey, I'm feelin' tired, my time is gone today 
 You flirt with suicide sometimes, that's okay 
 Do what others say, I'm here standing hollow 
 Falling away from me, falling away from me 
 The day is here, fading, that's when I'm insane 
 I flirt with suicide sometimes, kill the pain 
 I can't always say, "It's gonna be better tomorrow" 
 Falling away from me, falling away from me 
 Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground 
 Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground 
 (Falling away from me) 
 It's spinning round and round 
 (Falling away from me) 
 It's lost and can't be found 
 (Falling away from me) 
 It's spinning round and round 
 (Falling away from me) 
 Slow it down 
 Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground 
 Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground 
 Twisting me, then walk away 
 So I pray, "Go away" 
 Life's falling away from me, it's falling away from me 
 Life's falling away from me, fuck 
 Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground 
 Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground 
 (Falling away from me) 
 Beating me down, beating me, beating me 
 (Falling away from me) 
 Down, down, into the ground 
 (Falling away from me) 
 Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me 
 (Falling away from me) 
 Down, down, into the groundIt hurts to breathe but I don't care 
 The weight of the world, the thoughts I couldn't bare 
 The city sleeps, I'm making plans 
 The less you know, the better understand 
 Then I look and see that place 
 It fools me every time 
 Digging deeper pulls me under 
 Am I wasting time? I'm next in line 
 I pace and fret, my blood, it burns 
 The reason we know but still we never learned 
 The clock stood still, my legs grow weak 
 It says it's done, I beg it not to speak 
 Then I look and see that place 
 It fools me every time 
 Digging deeper pulls me under 
 Am I wasting time? I'm next in line 
 But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a-fucking-fraid 
 Never wanna, never gonna and your bed is made 
 But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a-fucking-fraid 
 Never wanna, never gonna and your bed is made 
 But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a-fucking-fraid 
 Never wanna, never gonna and your bed is made 
 But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a-fucking-fraid 
 Never wanna, never gonna and your bed is made 
 Then I look and see that place 
 It fools me every time 
 Digging deeper pulls me under 
 Am I wasting time? 
 Then I look and see that place 
 It fools me every time 
 Digging deeper pulls me under 
 Am I wasting time? I'm next in lineI am clearly broken and no one knows what to do 
 Pieces of the puzzle don't fit so I pound them into you 
 Itching is the pulse inside, creeping up to come alive 
 It's just doing what it's gonna do 
 Times are looking grim these days 
 Holding on to everything, it's hard to draw the line 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 I can't wait to rip my eyes out and look at you 
 Peace through pain is precious, 'specially when it's done by you 
 Itching is the pulse inside, creeping up to come alive 
 It's just doing what it's gonna do 
 Times are looking grim these days 
 Holding on to everything, it's hard to draw the line 
 And I, I'm hiding in this empty space 
 Tortured by my memories of what I left behind 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Times are looking grim these days 
 Holding on to everything, it's hard to draw the line 
 And I, I'm hiding in this empty space 
 Tortured by my memories of what I left behind 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get up 
 Shut the fuck up, get upThe hunger inside given to me makes me what I am 
 Always it is calling me for the blood of man 
 They say I cannot be this I am jaded, hiding from the day 
 I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me 
 Oh, I say I did and always searching, you can't fuck with me 
 So instead you'll taste my pain. 
 The hunger inside given to me makes me feel alive 
 Always out stalking prey in the dark I hide 
 Feeling, falling, hating, feel like I am fading, hating life 
 They say I cannot be this I am jaded, hiding from the day 
 I can't bare, I cannot tame the hunger in me 
 Oh, I say I did and always searching, you can't fuck with fate 
 So instead you'll taste my pain 
 You say your life I'm taking, always bothering me 
 I can't take this anymore, I'm failing, always smothering me 
 You look down on me, hey, what you see 
 Take this gift from me, you will soon be me 
 Nothing seems exciting, always the same hiding, hiding 
 It's haunting me, it's haunting me 
 It's haunting me, it's haunting me 
 It's haunting meThe hating, it's pulled inside of me 
 They're trying to test my sanity 
 Insinuating, it's all make believe 
 And they're ripping the child within me 
 Cheating the time that I have left 
 Needing my soul 'cause that's the bet 
 Giving all that that I can give 
 Controlling my mind that is diseased 
 Holding my hate that is released 
 Scalding the hand that keeps me fed, that keeps me fed 
 Fed, that keeps me fed 
 Fed, that keeps me 
 I feel it all come crashing down on me 
 I feel alone and torn apart 
 I wasted time to let it get to me 
 An angry mouth with a broken heart 
 Searching for something that is safe 
 Hurting my pride, that is the test 
 Turning my anger towards your flesh 
 Rotting we're hoping ain't that bad 
 Spilling the blood that's on the bed 
 Scalding the hand that keeps me fed, that keeps me fed 
 Fed, that keeps me fed 
 I feel it all come crashing down on me 
 I feel alone and torn apart 
 I wasted time to let it get to me 
 An angry mouth with a broken heart 
 The hating, it's pulled inside of me 
 They're trying to test my sanity 
 Insinuating, it's all make believe 
 And they're ripping the child from within me 
 The hating, it's pulled inside of me 
 They're trying to test my sanity 
 Insinuating, it's all make believe 
 And they're ripping the child from within me 
 No, no, noI'm over it 
 You see I'm falling in the vast abyss 
 Clouded by memories of the past 
 At last I see 
 I hear it fading, I can't speak it 
 Or else you will dig my grave 
 You feel them finding, always whining 
 Take my hand now be alive 
 You see I cannot be forsaken 
 Because I'm not the only one 
 We walk amongst you feeding, raping 
 Must we hide from everyone? 
 I'm over it 
 Why can't we be together embrace it? 
 Sleeping so long taking off the mask 
 At last I see 
 My fear is fading, I can't speak it 
 Or else you will dig my grave 
 You feel them finding, always whining 
 Take my hand now be alive 
 You see I cannot be forsaken 
 Because I'm not the only one 
 We walk amongst you feeding, raping 
 Must we hide from everyone? 
 You see I cannot be forsaken

 A cowardly man.I'm not doing great, I feel like I'm dead, not thinking straight 
 Inside my body, troubled, full of hate 
 I had to let it out before it's too late 
 Deep inside, it can hide, feeling so lost and betrayed 
 Why does this happen to me every time? 
 Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
 Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 Why won't it fade? 
 Outside I had to lie, "I'm okay" 
 I hope someday, I'll stop getting pain 
 I guess this is the lie, I have made 
 Deep inside, it can hide, feeling so lost and betrayed 
 Why does this happen to me every time? 
 Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
 Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 What am I doing? I can't believe this 
 I have been hiding, wanting to be less 
 Giving to people, they take from me 
 Always they're bringing drama to me 
 Look, look at me now, now 
 Feeling so lost and betrayed 
 Why does this happen to me every time? 
 Stuck in this place, where I can't escape 
 Screaming and clawing from deep inside 
 I can't stand all of this fucking pain

 Wanting to give in needing your help. 
 Skin cold with fear feel it when we touch. 
 Outside I don't know you but inside I'm fine. 
 Can you see it in me? Skin cold from touch. 
 Each day confronted with what I have done. 
 You pull me closer, I push you away. 
 You tell me it's okay I can't help but feel the pain. 
 I like you. 
 Why are you taken? 
 I love you. 
 I feel so helpless. 
 Why is it you? 
 Ripping my insides each time I lay with you. 
 Why do I cry? 
 Why do I really need to? 
 Why!?! 
 Why!?!

 Why!?! 
 ---- You, bitch! 
 Need to... Need to... Need to. 
 I like you.

 Ripping my insides each time I lay with you. 
 Why do I cry? 
 Why do I ----in' need to?I'm getting out, I'm leaving here, I'm kickin' right through this door 
 I stole your girl who was my girl, I always said she's a whore 
 Rush through, accelerate from everything I hate 
 Now this is my kind of disaster 
 Break in and take what we want, and then burn down the liquor store 
 Pick up our friends, tell them, "It's on, get in, don't ask what it's for" 
 Subwoofer kickin' in, porn on the TV screen 
 These spinnin' rims don't go no faster 
 We can drive all night, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 Just follow the light, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 We're flippin' off the people who dissed on us, that's just a game 
 We're throwin' bricks right through their windows, and then we drive away 
 And break this, spin around new things I could've found 
 We keep on changin' our direction 
 Go past the school, the church, the places that caused us hurt, we're gone 
 If we keep movin' forward maybe we'll forget where we're from 
 We're gonna shake things up, we're gonna break it down 
 We fuel this car with our rejection 
 We can drive all night, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 Just follow the light, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 You can never go back, not even if you wanted to, no way, you're in deep now 
 You've been fuckin' up real good lately, one minute you come from zero, go now 
 We can drive all night, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one 
 Just follow the light, and we're not gonna stomp on the brakes for no one

 Oh, why don't they fly away? 
 Surely they'd have guessed by now, there is no gun to shoot them down 
 And still they stay for what they say 
 Are they killing them with lies? 
 Are they fighting for their lives? 
 Killing them with thoughts, scared they'll never get enough 
 Killing them, are we killing, killing every single feeling? 
 It's a trained response 
 Birds are circling above, they're called back to a waiting glove 
 This sordid game, it fears my name

 Once I cry, now I wipe away the tears 
 Once I die, now I'm alive 
 Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive 
 Little things tempt me everyday, 'cause the pain is how I like to play 
 Better not cross that line, voices in my head have to be saved 
 It's something I can't throw away, what's inside my mind 
 I am alive, I will never run away 
 Places inside, my heart screams inside with pride 
 Once I cry, now I wipe away the tears 
 Once I die, now I'm alive 
 I find my time, I'm intertwined 
 I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind 
 I find my time, I'm intertwined 
 I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind 
 I find my time, I'm intertwined (Feeling so alive) 
 I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind 
 I find my time, I'm intertwined (Feeling so Alive) 
 I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind 
 Alive, alive, alive, alive 
 I am alive, I will never run away 
 Places inside, my heart screams inside with pride 
 Once I cry, now I wipe away the tears 
 Once I die, now I'm aliveI'm plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred 
 That's falling down, at least they start to fry 
 Why can't I be removed, take their places? 
 Sometimes it's better to eat their scars 
 These are the times of the waking liar 
 Hold him close or you will expire 
 Holding on to the place you're thinking 
 Total deceit 
 I like to lose hope 
 Recede and cope 
 Like a beautiful rape 
 These things, aren't they great? 
 I'm terrified by emotionless faces 
 They're all around me I want to die 
 I'm fucking trippin' out seeing traces 
 Of murderers covered in lye 
 These are the times of the waking liar 
 Hold him close or you will expire 
 Holding on to the place you're thinking 
 Total deceit 
 I like to lose hope 
 Recede and cope 
 Like a beautiful rape 
 These things, aren't they great? 
 I love the things that make you upset 
 The more you hurt, the stronger I get 
 I love the things that make you upset 
 The more you hurt, the stronger I get! 
 I like to lose hope 
 Recede and cope 
 Like a beautiful rape 
 These things, aren't they great? 
 Aren't they great?I'm feeling mean today 
 Not lost, not thrown away 
 Just irritated and quite hated 
 Self control breaks down 
 Why's everything so tame? 
 I like my life insane 
 I'm barricading and debating 
 Who I'm gonna kick around 
 Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you 
 Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you 
 I'm feeling cold today 
 Not hurt, just fucked away 
 I'm devastated and frustrated 
 God I feel so bound 
 So when I feel the need 
 I think it's time to bleed 
 I'm gonna cut myself 
 A watch the blood 
 Hit the ground 
 Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you 
 Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you 
 You open your mouth again 
 I swear I'm gonna break it 
 You open your mouth again 
 My God I cannot take it 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up 
 Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you 
 Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you 
 I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you 
 I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you! 
 I fucking hate you 
 (Shut up) 
 I fucking hate you 
 (Shut up) 
 I fucking hate you 
 (Shut up, shut up)Sometimes things get in the way, my thoughts I cannot convey 
 It's all pointing straight at you 
 We hate loving everyday 
 Our lives, twirled in every way, I give it all back to you 
 I can't help this going down 
 I can't take this, all my life is reckless 
 All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through 
 That's what we do, we do 
 Sometimes, things don't go away 
 In turn, you just run away 
 It's all coming back for you, betrayed, life is in decay 
 Your thoughts you cannot obey 
 Right now, whatcha gonna do? 
 I can't help this going down 
 I can't take this, all my life is reckless 
 All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through 
 That's what we do, we do, we do, we do 
 We do, we do, we do 
 We do, we do, we do 
 I hear the calling of the helpless stranger 
 He's all alone and no one gets his anger 
 I feel this pain every time I'm here with you, with you 
 All the heartache and the fucked up insults 
 I find you begging on your knees, I figured 
 This is how it's supposed to be with you, with you 
 I can't wait for your lies to be broken down 
 I gave you Hell 
 I can't take this, all my life is reckless 
 All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through 
 That's what we do 
 I can't take this, all my life is reckless 
 All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through 
 That's what we doSo, so young 
 Raped, but I don't realize 
 Small white legs, broke, the pain between her thighs 
 I see your pretty face smashed against the bathroom floor 
 What a disgrace, who do I feel sorry for? 
 Skin so cold, how could someone steal a life? 
 Save the blame, wait, I got some shit to say 
 I see your pretty face smashed against the bathroom floor 
 What a disgrace, who do I feel sorry for? 
 Smashed and raped, not again, this is a real crime 
 What a pretty face, who do I feel sorry for? 
 Rape, something now rips my heart and takes my soul 
 I wait, too late, now I feel hate inside 
 Take my soul away, away 
 I see your pretty face smashed against the bathroom floor 
 What a disgrace, who do I feel sorry for? 
 Smashed and raped, not again, this is a real crime 
 What a pretty face, who do I feel sorry for?Standing inside rotting away, something inside of me has been taken away 
 Feeling my heart breaking in vain, it won't get better now 
 When will this end? 
 I can't seem to get away, I feel I'm here so you can play with my head 
 There's nothing I can say, I keep feeling like I'm to blame 
 When will this end? 
 Hopeless inside alone as I wait, brewing inside of me enduring this hate 
 Feeling my heart breaking in vain, it won't get better now 
 When will this end? 
 I can't seem to get away, I feel I'm here so you can play with my head 
 There's nothing I can say, I keep feeling like I'm to blame 
 When will this end? 
 The stress is rising and I can't seem to get away from you 
 You're always trying and the lying always shines right through 
 My God, I hate this, always take shit 
 Can I let this go on? 
 Why can't I break this? 
 I just take this as this goes on and on 
 End, when will this end, when will this end, when will this end? 
 When will this end, when will this end, when will this end, when will this end? 
 When will this end? 
 I can't seem to get away, I feel I'm here so you can play with my head 
 There's nothing I can say, I keep feeling like I'm to blame 
 When will this end?As it all falls down, do I walk away 
 Or do I stand my ground and accept my fate? 
 And there's the faceless cries that twist my every dream 
 And almost every night I hear the demon sing 
 Why are we going on this way? 
 Why do we play these games in vain? 
 Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
 So why did the path have to lead this way? 
 Black is the soul that's led astray 
 You're leading me to places I can never follow 
 Happiness is found in the darkest ways 
 And as I searched around, I knew nothing but mistakes 
 And there's the faceless cries that twist my every dream 
 And almost every night I hear the demon sing 
 Why are we going on this way? 
 Why do we play these games in vain? 
 Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
 So why did the path have to lead this way? 
 Black is the soul that's led astray 
 You're leading me to places I can never follow 
 And when you scream, you push me so much further ahead 
 And when I leave, I always walk right back again 
 And when you cry, the tears are cleansing bitterness 
 I'm out of time, I'm slowly dying, give me back my life 
 Just give me back my life 
 Just give me back my life 
 Just give me back my life 
 Why are we going on this way? 
 Why do we play these games? 
 Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again 
 So why did the path have to lead this way? 
 Black is the soul that's led astray 
 You're leading me to places I can never follow 
 As it all falls down, do I walk away 
 Or do I stand my ground? There's nothing left to sayI'll never love again (Love again, love again) 
 I won't ever have to pretend (Pretend, pretend, pretend, pretend) 
 I'm never gonna love again (Love again, love again) 
 Damn 
 I don't ever want to have to try and though I lie, it never flies 
 I don't ever wanna have to die, but deep inside, the death it hides 
 And I never wanna clarify and justify, so I run and hide 
 And I never wanna signify, so I pacify all the hate inside 
 (No) I'll never love again 
 (No) I won't ever have to pretend 
 (No) I'm never gonna love again 
 Never gonna have to try to pretend 
 Never, never, never 
 I don't ever wanna satisfy, 'cause things inside are doin' fine 
 I don't ever wanna multiply, 'cause deep inside I'm not qualified 
 And I never wanna clarify and justify, so I run and hide 
 And I never wanna signify, so I pacify all the hate inside 
 (No) I'll never love again 
 (No) I won't ever have to pretend 
 (No) I'm never gonna love again 
 Never gonna have to try to pretend 
 Never, never, never 
 I'll never love again 
 I'm never gonna love again 
 Never, never, never 
 (No) I'll never love again 
 (No) I won't ever have to pretend 
 (No) I'm never gonna love again 
 Never gonna have to try to pretend 
 Never, never, never 
 (No) Never, never, never 
 (No) Never, never, never 
 (No) I'm never gonna love again 
 Never gonna have to try to pretend 
 Never, never, neverWhen you were here before 
 Couldn't look you in the eye 
 You're just like an angel 
 Your skin makes me cry 
 You float like a feather 
 In a beautiful world 
 I wish I was special 
 You're so fuckin' special 
 But I'm a creep 
 I'm a weirdo 
 What the hell am I doin' here? 
 I don't belong here 
 I don't care if it hurts 
 I wanna have control 
 I want a perfect body 
 I want a perfect soul 
 I want you to notice 
 When I'm not around 
 You're so fuckin' special 
 I wish I was special 
 But I'm a creep 
 I'm a weirdo 
 What the hell am I doin' here? 
 I don't belong here, oh oh 
 She's running out the door 
 She's running out 
 She run, run, run, run 
 Run 
 Whatever makes you happy 
 Whatever you want 
 You're so fuckin' special 
 I wish I was special 
 But I'm a creep 
 I'm a weirdo 
 What the hell am I doin' here? 
 I don't belong here 
 I don't belong hereHate, something, sometime, some way 
 Something kicked down the front floor 
 Mine? 
 Something inside, I'll never ever follow 
 So give me something that is for real, I'll never, ever follow 
 Get your boogie on, get your boogie on 
 Hate, something, some way, each day 
 Feeling ripped off again now 
 Why? This shit inside 
 Now everyone will follow 
 So give me nothing, just feel, and all the shit will follow 
 God thinks we will never see the light 
 Who wants to see? 
 God told me, I've already got the life 
 Oh, I say 
 God thinks we will never see the light 
 Who wants to see? 
 God told me, I've already got the life 
 Oh, I say 
 Each day I can feel it swallow inside 
 Something torn from me, I don't feel your deathly ways 
 Each day I feel so hollow inside, always beating me 
 You'll never see, so come dance with me 
 Dance with me, dance with me 
 Dance with me, dance with me 
 Dance with me, dance with me 
 Me 
 God thinks we will never see the light 
 Who wants to see?

 I wanna bring up Amy Lee from Evanescence. 
 Amy Lee: 
 You're too sweet. 
 Jonathan: 
 We thought this would be a cool song to do together so, um... y'all enjoy. 
 Jonathan: 
 Something takes a part of me. 
 Something lost and never seen. 
 Every time I start to believe, 
 Something's raped and taken from me... from me. 
 Life's got to always be messing with me. 
 Amy Lee: 
 You wanna see the light. 
 Jonathan: 
 Can't they chill and let me be free? 
 Amy Lee: 
 So do I. 
 Jonathan: 
 Can't I take away all this pain? 
 Amy Lee: 
 You wanna see the light. 
 Jonathan: 
 I try to every night, all in vain... 
 Both: 
 In vain. 
 Both: 
 Sometimes I cannot take this place. 
 Sometimes it's my life I can't taste. 
 Sometimes I cannot feel my face. 
 You'll never see me fall from grace. 
 Something takes a part of me. 
 You and I were meant to be. 
 A cheap (...) for me to lay. 
 Something takes a part of me. 
 Jonathan: 
 Feeling like a freak on a leash. 
 Amy Lee: 
 You wanna see the light. 
 Jonathan: 
 Feeling like I have no release. 
 Amy Lee: 
 So do I. 
 Jonathan: 
 How many times have I felt diseased? 
 Amy Lee: 
 You wanna see the light. 
 Jonathan: 
 Nothing in my life is free... is free.

 You wanna play with me? 
 I'm really gonna rock your world 
 You wanna come for me?

 Deep in this hole am I making? 
 I can't escape, falling all this time 
 We come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow life 
 Always we're taking, waiting for signs 
 Hollow life 
 Fearing to fall and still the ground below me calls, falling down this time 
 Ripping apart all these things I have tried to stop, falling all this time 
 We come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow life 
 Always we're taking, waiting for signs 
 Hollow life 
 Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky? 
 Search in vain, asking why 
 All alone, where is God looking down? 
 We don't know 
 We fall in space, we can't look down 
 Death may come, peace I have found 
 What to say? Am I alive? 
 Am I asleep? Or have I died? 
 (Haunting me) 
 We fall in space 
 (Haunting me) 
 We can't look down 
 Death may come, peace I have found 
 (Something takes a part of me) 
 What to say? 
 (Something takes a part of me) 
 Am I alive? Am I asleep? 
 We fall down 
 We come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow life 
 Always we're taking, waiting for signs 
 Hollow life 
 Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky? 
 Search in vain, asking why? 
 All alone, where is God looking down? 
 We don't know 
 Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky? 
 Search in vain, asking why? 
 All alone, where is God looking down? 
 We don't know 
 We fall in space, we can't look down 
 Death may come, peace I have foundYou came into my life 
 Without a single thing 
 I gave in to your ways, 
 Which left me with nothing 
 I've given in to smiles, 
 I fell for all your games 
 I wish so bad right now, 
 I hadn't let you in 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 The sea of life, 
 You're just a minnow 
 Live your life insecure 
 Feel the pain of your needles 
 As they shit into my brain 
 I scream without a sound. 
 How could you take away 
 Everything that I was? 
 Made me a fuckin' slave. 
 Your face that I despise. 
 Your heart inside that's grey. 
 I came today to say 
 You're fucked in every way 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 The sea of life, 
 You're just a minnow 
 Live your life insecure 
 Feel the pain of your needles 
 As they shit into my mind 
 You stole my life 
 Without a sigh 
 You suck me dry 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 Now?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 NOW!?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 NOW!?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 NOW!?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 NOW!?! 
 Won't you get the fuck out of my face 
 NOW!?! 
 The sea of life, 
 You're just a minnow 
 Live your life insecure 
 Feel the pain of your needles 
 As they shit into my mind 
 You stole my life 
 Without a sigh 
 You suck me dryIt's the really new way you hold your head 
 It's like insanity is hanging on a thread 
 The flesh feels cold underneath your nails 
 And the look you give me never fails, never fails 
 I love the way you hurt me 
 I love that you don't care 
 My love is dark and twisted 
 And I scream when you're not there 
 It's the interesting way you pierce my brain 
 It's within my urges but never the same 
 I love it when you help me you crack a smile 
 The best is when you make it last a while, last a while 
 I love the way you hurt me 
 I love that you don't care 
 My love is dark and twisted 
 And I scream when you're not there 
 Can't seem to get away 
 This ghost I'll never find 
 It haunts me till this day 
 I can't get back my time 
 I love the way you hurt me 
 I love that you don't care 
 My love is dark and twisted 
 And I scream when you're not thereMy life is such a waste 
 Begging on something to work this time 
 But why can't I relate? 
 Feeling all like who is get what's mine 
 Holding on to faith, never gave me nothing but despair 
 So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
 I can't take (we have a start) 
 I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
 Come what may (we are the stars) 
 I can't wait (I'll take what's mine) 
 Believing all this time before a crowd could side 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 Believing all this time too far to cross the line 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 I Cannot take this place 
 Burning up inside this space of mine 
 Why can't I replace, feelings I find hard to really find? 
 I try but I can't taste 
 Memories they always fuck with me 
 So why do I create just to be swallowed? 
 I can't take (we have a start) 
 I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
 Come what may (we are the stars) 
 I can't wait (I'll take what's mine) 
 Believing all this time before a crowd could side 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 Believing all this time too far to cross the line 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find, 
 Find, find, find, find, find, find, find 
 All my feelings have been eating onto me 
 Feed inside, is there something wrong 
 With me? 
 I can't take (we have a start) 
 I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
 Come what may (we are the stars) 
 I can't wait (I'll take what's mine) 
 Believing all this time before a crowd could side 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find 
 Believing all this time too far to cross the line 
 Believing all the basics of everything that I could find, 
 Find, find, find, find, find, find, findHate is all around 
 If you see what I see 
 Definitely something's going on 
 These fingers pointed at me. 
 The lying 
 The cheating 
 The hellish nights alone while I am weeping 
 Just searching 
 Love is Never Around 
 All the waiting 
 Betraying 
 The one thing I hold sacred in my life is 
 Left hanging 
 And I'm Never Around. 
 Let go 
 And I will truly be free 
 Just let go 
 Her mind really is the disease 
 So just go 
 Enjoy everything I received 
 So let go 
 And I will kill this unease. 
 Let's turn this around 
 I'll look down on me 
 Now I see what's going on 
 Worrying about you all and not me. 
 The prying 
 The cheating 
 The hellish nights alone while I am weeping 
 Just Searching 
 Love is Never Around 
 All the waiting 
 Betraying 
 The one thing I hold sacred in my life is 
 Left hanging 
 And I'm Never Around. 
 Let go 
 And I will truly be free 
 Just let go 
 My mind is really the disease 
 So just go 
 Enjoy everything I received 
 So let go 
 And I will kill this unease. 
 Laughter: 
 Hate is all around 
 If you see what I see 
 Definitely something's going on 
 These fingers 
 Pointed at me 
 Pointed at me 
 These fingers 
 Pointed at me. 
 Let go 
 And I will truly be free 
 Just let go 
 Her mind is really the disease 
 So just go 
 Enjoy everything I received 
 So let go 
 And I will kill this unease.When it's crying, take me to a certain place which I don't often find 
 I see a family walking, always thinking of being somewhere else in time 
 So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of 
 Please, wake me 
 Please, give me some of it back, the feelings that I had 
 Sometimes I wish I could be strong, like you, it doesn't matter 
 Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth I can't handle 
 Let's get this party started, I'm sick of begging you 
 You make me feel insane, which I did to you 
 Let's get this party started, you make me feel insane 
 I want to be the one to make myself sane 
 Time is ticking, it makes me feel content with what I have inside 
 Constant paranoia surrounds me, everyone I see is out to get me 
 So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of 
 Please, wake me 
 Please, give me some of it back, the feelings that I had 
 Sometimes I wish I could be strong, like you, it doesn't matter 
 Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth I can't handle 
 Let's get this party started, I'm sick of begging you 
 You make me feel insane, which I did to you 
 Let's get this party started, you make me feel insane 
 I want to be the one to make myself sane 
 You make me feel insane, you make me feel insane 
 You make me feel insane, you make me feel insane 
 You make me feel insane, you make me feel insane 
 Sometimes I wish I could be strong, like you, it doesn't matter 
 Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth I can't handle 
 Let's get this party started, I'm sick of begging you 
 You make me feel insane, which I did to you 
 Let's get this party started, you make me feel insane 
 I want to be the one to make myself saneSo you've seen I've gotten this far 
 Please give me some place to rage 
 I'm not trying to go there, 
 So take me away 
 Life sometimes pisses me off 
 It's never a good trip for me 
 Every time I reach for love, 
 It's taken away 
 Night! So I play 
 Give me a sign, 
 This is gay 
 Give me some patience, 
 So I pray 
 It's time to die. 
 Is that what I want? 
 There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved 
 Is there something wrong with me? 
 For once in my life I'd like to be really set free 
 Let me be me 
 Night! So I play 
 Give me a sign, 
 This is gay 
 Give me some guidance, 
 So I pray 
 It's time to die. 
 Is that what I want? 
 (Take) 
 Take me away 
 (Take) 
 Taken away 
 (Take) 
 Take me away 
 (Take) 
 Taken it away 
 (*Scat Singing*) 
 Night! So I play 
 Give me a sign, 
 This is gay 
 Give me some patience, 
 So I pray 
 It's time to die. 
 Is that what I want? 
 Night! So I play 
 Give me a sign, 
 This is gay 
 Give me some guidance, 
 So I pray 
 It's time to die. 
 Is that what I want?You can see I fly 
 Disguised evil attracting everybody 
 You can watch me play 
 Taste your juices from me all day 
 You can see I tried this all for you 
 You can see I dispise all of you 
 You can see I'm trying something new 
 You can see me fly 
 Sometime, somewhere 
 Deceit leads you no where 
 You try so hard 
 To be the (super star?) 
 So come in with me 
 Take your under sun light set you free 
 Somewhere can't you see 
 Going on this way 
 Free you'll never be 
 So you see I tried this all for you 
 So you see I dispise all of you 
 So you see I'm trying something new 
 So you see me fly 
 Just take me away 
 Take me away (Take me) 
 Take me 
 Take me away... 
 Take... me... away...Lodi Dodi, we likes to party 
 We don't cause trouble, 
 We don't bother nobody 
 We're just some kids who on the mic 
 And when we rock up on the mic, 
 We rock the mic rightYou and me, we have no faces, soon our lives will be erased 
 Do you think they will remember, or will we just be replaced? 
 Oh, I wish that I could see, how I wish that I could fly 
 Far from things that hang above me, to a place where I can cry 
 So why can it be? No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me, no one's there 
 To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
 You and me, we have no faces, they don't see us anymore 
 Without love as they had promised, and no faith for what's in store 
 Oh, I wish that I could see, how I wish that I could fly 
 Far from things that hang above me, to a place where I can cry 
 So why can it be? No one hears me call 
 Echoes back at me, no one's there 
 To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
 Where are all these feelings hiding? Dancing in and out my mind 
 Burning up all that I long for, speeding me to my decline 
 Where are you? My soul is bleeding 
 I am searching, am I blind? 
 All alone and bound forever, trapped inside me for all time 
 To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behind 
 To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life 
 To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine 
 You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind 
 I know it's time to leave these places far behindAll right, stop 
 Collaborate and listen 
 Ice is back, I got a brand new invention 
 Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
 Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly 
 Will it ever stop? 
 Yo--I don't know 
 Turn off the lights and I'll glow to the extreme 
 I rock a mic like a vandal 
 Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Too cold 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Don't you be talkin' that shit 
 Dance 
 Bum rush the speaker that booms 
 I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
 Deadly, when I play a dope melody 
 Anything less that the best is a felony 
 Love it or leave it 
 You better gain way 
 You better hit bull's eye 
 The kid don't play 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo, I'll solve it 
 Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 
 Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it 
 My town, that created all the bass sound 
 Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill 
 Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel 
 Conducted and formed 
 This is a hell of a concept 
 We make it hype and you want to step with this 
 DJ plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja 
 Cut like a razor blade so fast 
 Other DJs say, "Damn" 
 If my rhyme was a drug 
 I'd sell it by the gram 
 Keep my composure when it's time to get loose 
 Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 
 If there was a problem 
 Yo--I'll solve it! 
 Check out the hook while DJ revolves it 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too fuckin' cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too cold 
 Ice, ice baby 
 Too cold, too coldThis broken soul x 17 
 II can't remember the day, when I lie and cried 
 I miss the time, the day, though I try, 
 To hide it from you, 
 This broken soul, I can't deny, Arms growin' cold 
 Nowhere to run, no one to hold me 
 This Broken Soul x 2 
 I still remember the way, 
 How you smiled as I cried, you laughed, I bled everyday 
 I could never get away from you 
 This broken soul, I can't deny, arms growin' so cold, 
 Nowhere to run, no one to hold me 
 This Broken Soul x 2 
 No one to hold me 
 I can't remember when, 
 You and I we walk as friends 
 Never seen, a foolish idea 
 How can these lies be a good bye now 
 I, I will find, 
 You in my way, 
 A different pain, 
 Took inside of me, 
 I will find x 4 
 You in my way, a different pain 
 Took the pride of me, one I'll never hold, 
 This Broken Soul x 8And along came something sacred 
 I never knew what I found 
 The demons dance around, elated 
 They're hurting me 
 I put my wall up each day 
 You tear it down 
 I hide in my space 
 The space you found 
 And one of these days 
 I'll come unbound 
 The feelings I hate 
 Will finally drown 
 Falling awake in a nightmare 
 Images of horror abound 
 Thought I stumbled upon salvation 
 Hell I found 
 I put my wall up each day 
 You tear it down 
 I hide in my space 
 The space you found 
 And one of these days 
 I'll come unbound 
 The feelings I hate 
 Will finally drown 
 Well, I'll never be the same 
 It's the greatest lie ever told 
 No, I'll never be the same 
 I sold my soul 
 I put my wall up each day 
 You tear it down 
 I hide in my space 
 The space you found 
 And one of these days 
 I'll come unbound 
 The feelings I hate 
 Will finally drownShit 
 All my friends drive a Lowrider 
 And the Lowrider is a little lower 
 Take a little trip 
 Take a little trip 
 Take a little trip, you and me 
 Ah yeah 
 Oh shit 
 Oh shit 
 Uh yepI wouldn't be angry if you just fucking cried 
 Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply 
 The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky 
 Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye 
 Digging deep inside of me 
 Getting past this agony 
 I can't seem to get away 
 Another day rotting in vain 
 I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same 
 You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain 
 The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky 
 Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye 
 Digging deep inside of me 
 Getting past this agony 
 I can't seem to get away 
 Another day rotting in 
 I can't take this 
 I can't fuck this 
 I can't fake this 
 Digging deep inside of me 
 Getting past this agony 
 I can't seem to get away 
 Another day rotting in 
 Digging deep inside of me 
 Getting past this agony 
 I can't seem to get away 
 Another day rotting in vainSo I think you are a fool, hanging on my every word 
 It's getting ugly, so what, I'm ugly? 
 Tear me from your heart, tearing me apart 
 So I thought you'd disappear, being alone is what you fear 
 Are you lonely? Yes, lonely 
 Tear me from your heart, tearing me apart

 With me getting in the way, my violent side 
 So I take my face and bash it into a mirror 
 I won't have to see the pain, pain, pain 
 This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating 
 Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again 
 My hurt inside is fading, this shit's gone way too far 
 All this time I've been waiting, oh, I cannot grieve anymore 
 For what's inside awaking, I'm done, I'm not a whore 
 You've taken everything, and, oh, I cannot give anymore 
 My mind's done with this, okay, I've got a question 
 Can I throw it all away? Take back what's mine 
 So I take my time guiding the blade down the line 
 Each cut, closer to the vein, pain, pain 
 This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating 
 Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again 
 My hurt inside is fading, this shit's gone way too far 
 All this time I've been waiting, oh, I cannot grieve anymore 
 For what's inside awaking, I'm done, I'm not a whore 
 You've taken everything, and, oh, I cannot give anymore 
 I'm here to stay 
 (Bring it down) 
 I'm here to stay 
 (Bring it down) 
 I'm here to stay 
 (Bring it down) 
 I'm here to stay 
 Bring it down, bring it down, bring it down, bring it down! 
 Gonna bring it down, gonna break it down 
 Gonna break it down, gonna break it down, gonna break it down 
 Gonna break it down, gonna break it down, gonna break it 
 This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating 
 Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again 
 My hurt inside is fading, this shit's gone way too far 
 All this time I've been waiting, oh, I cannot grieve anymore 
 For what's inside awaking, I'm done, I'm not a whore 
 You've taken everything, and, oh, I cannot give anymore 
 Give anymore, give anymore, give anymore, give anymoreWhy can't I decide? 
 Why my feelings I hide? 
 Always screwing with my mind, 
 That thorn in my spine. 
 Oh sure, it feels fine, 
 Wasting all our time. 
 In the back of my mind, 
 That thorn in my spine. 
 Wait! 
 See it before my eyes. 
 Why? 
 Do I turn away? 
 Looking all the time, 
 At your face so blind. 
 Feeling uptight, 
 Always the same fight. 
 Hey man now decide, 
 Go ahead take your time. 
 Kissing all the time, 
 That thorn in my spine. 
 Wait! 
 You cannot see inside. 
 Why! 
 Play yourself out that way. 
 Why! 
 You and me always hate. 
 Wait! 
 Weren't you my friend? 
 The pain and rage and fear I feel! 
 The pain and rage and fear I feel! 
 The pain and rage and fear I feel!

 Wait! You were my friend. 
 Wait! You were my friend. 
 Wait! You were my friend. 
 Wait! You were my friend.Feelings you see are so hard to believe 
 All the chaos I have in my heart 
 Devils I make and the love can relate 
 All the solace inside tears me up 
 Take me away, set me on fire 
 There's no other way 
 Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain 
 So what are we doing now? 
 Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now 
 Weaving deceit is so easy for me 'cause the loathing I've had from the start 
 Evil disease all the hatred it breathes as I'm down on my knees torn apart 
 Take me away, set me on fire 
 There's no other way 
 Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain 
 So what are we doing now? 
 Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now 
 Where do I run? Where do I hide? 
 Give me a reason to my end my life 
 Where do I run? Where do I hide? 
 Give me a reason to get out alive 
 Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain 
 So what are we doing now? 
 Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now 
 Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain 
 So what am I doing now? 
 (What am I doing now?) 
 Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely nowI can't stand to let you win 
 I'm just watching you 
 And I don't know what to do 
 Feeling like a fool inside 
 Feeling all the love you hide 
 Thought you were my friend 
 Seems it never ends 
 I need somebody, someone 
 Can't somebody help me? 
 All I need is to be 
 Loved just for me 
 Giving you this and that 
 Giving gave me nothing back 
 It's all related to 
 All the things I do 
 Feeling like a fool inside 
 Seeing all the things you tried 
 I am nothing 
 I need somebody, someone 
 Can't somebody help me? 
 All I need is to be loved just for me 
 I look, I sign 
 I need someone 
 Inside, to help me out 
 With what 
 I'm trying 
 I'm crying 
 I'm frying 
 In a pile of

 Don't wanna talk about politics 
 Refuse to talk about politics 
 Don't make me talk about politics 
 Don't give a shit about politics 
 You wanna sleep with him to get to who you need to know 
 Think that's the way to go, don't you? 
 Don't you? 
 It's in religion, sex and everything we do and say 
 I look the other way. Won't you? 
 Won't you? 
 Everybody's race 
 Lying to your face 
 Kicks you in the guts 
 Leaves you here all messed up 
 Don't wanna talk about politics

 I look the other way. Won't you? 
 Won't you? 
 Tiny splinters are in your soul and they remain there 
 Darkest light in the deepest hole, you sit and pray there 
 All the deals and the deeds you've done, you would've never worked for 
 What you thought was so much fun you'll have to pay for 
 Don't wanna talk about politics 
 Refuse to talk about politics 
 Don't make me talk about politics 
 Don't give a shit about politics 
 You wanna sleep with him to get to who you need to know

 I was down and you took me up past the ceiling 
 You are the disease 
 I'm the remedy that numbs all your feelings 
 You come lookin' for me 
 I'm the only one that keeps you sound 
 Bring it down to your knees 
 'Cause I'm the only that makes you, you, y-you 
 Take me 
 Please take me 
 It's the only way 
 Please take me 
 You came after me 
 I'm not worth anything if I'm not inside you 
 Only you can truly see 
 All the hell you put me through and the vicious feeding 
 Can't really be free 
 'Cause every time I run away, you hunt me down 
 I can't ever blame me 
 'Cause every time I turn around it's you, you, you, it's you 
 Take me 
 Please take me 
 It's the only way 
 Please take me 
 I feel it dulling, I feel it helping me 
 It's taking everything I love away from me 
 I feel it ripping, I feel it scarring me 
 This shit has made me blind to all reality 
 I feel it calling 
 I feel it calling 
 It's calling me 
 Go away, away 
 Go away, away 
 Take me 
 Please take me 
 It's the only way 
 Please take me 
 Take me 
 Please take me 
 It's the only way 
 Please take meI want a love that's right 
 Right is only half of what's wrong 
 I want a short-haired girl 
 Who sometimes wears it twice as long 
 Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe 
 Baby, I'm in love with you 
 I'm so glad you came here 
 It won't be the same now 
 I'm telling you 
 You know, you pick me up 
 From where some try to drag me down 
 When I see your smile 
 Replacing every thoughtless frown 
 Got me escaping from this zoo 
 Baby, I'm in love with you 
 So glad you came here 
 Won't be the same now 
 When I'm with you 
 If I grow up I'll be a singer 
 Wearing rings on every finger 
 Not worrying what they or you'll say 
 I'll live and love but maybe some day 
 Who knows, baby? 
 You may comfort me 
 Hey! 
 I may appear to be imperfect 
 My love is something you can't reject 
 I'm changing faster than the weather 
 If you and me should get together 
 Who knows, baby? 
 You may comfort me 
 (Hey) I know my love is yours to miss 
 That love is something I'd hate 
 I'll make an early start 
 I'm making sure that I'm not late (hey) 
 For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue 
 Baby, I'm in love with you 
 I'm so glad you came here 
 It won't be the same now when I'm with you 
 And I'm so glad you came here 
 It won't be the same now when I'm with you

 Aren't we cool and aren't we calm? 
 For facing death, we run head-on 
 Aren't we cool and aren't we calm? 
 The God reserved for false alarm 
 Aren't we cool and aren't we calm? 
 For facing death, we run head-on 
 Do what they say, or they take it away 
 I'd rather be dead than carry on

 So I carry on with this burden 
 I can't remember anything, I can't be certain 
 Aren't we cool and aren't we calm? 
 For facing death, we run head-on 
 Do what they say, or they take it away 
 I'd rather be dead than carry onI'm feeling mean today 
 My life's not thrown away 
 Just irritated and quite hated 
 Self control breaks down 
 Why's everything so tame? 
 I hate my life insane. 
 I'm barricading and debating who I'm gonna kick around. 
 Right Now 
 Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you. 
 Right Now 
 I feel it scratch inside I wanna slash and beat you. 
 Right Now 
 I rip apart the things inside that excite you. 
 Right Now 
 I can't control myself I know I hate you! 
 I'm feeling cold today 
 Not hurt, just turned away. 
 I'm devastated and frustrated 
 God I feel so bound. 
 So what? I feel the need 
 I think it's time to bleed. 
 I'm gonna cut myself and watch the blood hit the ground. 
 Right Now 
 Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right Now 
 I feel it scratch inside I wanna slash and beat you. 
 Right Now 
 I rip apart the things inside that excite you 
 Right Now 
 I can't control myself I know I hate you! 
 You open your mouth again, 
 I swear I'm gonna break it. 
 You open your mouth again, 
 My God I cannot take it. 
 Shut up, Shut up, 
 Shut up, I'll bust you up. [x6] 
 Right Now 
 Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you 
 Right Now 
 I feel it scratch inside I wanna slash and beat you. 
 Right Now

 Robert Smith 
 spoken: 
 Well, this is a very very special event for us, especially what we're gonna do right now. 
 This band that we chose as our guest, was a band that totally got me through high school. 
 I could totally relate to what they sing about, and the music. 
 This band was basically the sound track of my life then. 
 And, this is Robert Smith from The Cure. 
 I am watchin' the rise and fall of my, salvation 
 There's so much, around me, such a lack of compassion 
 I thought it would be fun and games, 
 Fun and games 
 Instead, it's all the same, 
 It's all the same 
 I want something to do 
 Need to feel the sickness, in you 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no not again, 
 Make me bad 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad, 
 Make me bad 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again, 
 Make me bad 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad 
 Yesterday I got so old I, felt like I could die 
 Yesterday away from you, it made me want to cry 
 Both 
 Go on, go on, just walk away 
 Go on, go on, your choice is made 
 Go on, go on, and disappear 
 Go on, go on, away from here 
 And I know I was wrong, when I said it was true 
 That it couldn't be me, and be her in between 
 Without you 
 Without you 
 Yesterday I got so scared, I shivered like a child 
 Yesterday away from you, it froze me deep inside 
 Both 
 Come back, come back, don't walk away 
 Come back, come back, come back today 
 Come back, come back, what can't you see 
 Come back, come back, come back to me 
 And I know I was wrong, when I said it was true 
 That it couldn't be me, and be her in between 
 Without you 
 Without you 
 All I do is look for you, I need my fix you need it too 
 Just to get some sort of attention, attention 
 What does it mean to you, 
 What does it mean to you 
 For me, it's something I just do, 
 I just do 
 I want something, I need to feel the sickness 
 In you 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no not again, 
 Make me bad 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad, 
 Make me bad 
 I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no not again, 
 Make me bad 
 It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad 
 Make me bad, 
 Come back, come back. 
 Does it make me bad, 
 Don't walk away 
 Come back, come back, come back today, 
 Make me bad 
 Come back, why can't you see,

 Without you, 
 Make me badCome on! 
 Save some for me, it's what I like. 
 I wanna play, you know it's time. 
 Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
 Come on! 
 It's on! 
 Now see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside. 
 Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
 Once I cave in, what can I fight? 
 I can never win, my self I don't like, 
 I don't like, I don't like, I don't like. 
 Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
 Come on! 
 It's on! 
 You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside. 
 Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
 This time. This... time. 
 For me, inside. Put me inside. 
 Hold me, this time. Put me inside. 
 Come on! 
 It's on!Well look at this

 You today. You today. 
 I don't care about anything around me 
 Even all the love that surrounds me 
 Beat me

 I don't care about anything 
 I do this to shut out the voice 
 Within' 
 Within' 
 Within'. 
 I don't care about anything.

 You today. You today. You today. 
 Feeling things crawl on me 
 I need my fix today 
 This is way beyond me 
 I can't live without you today.I'm shrouded and sedated 
 Patiently awaiting for my mind to really come down 
 I'm afraid of being hated 
 'Cause I'm so jaded 
 Not like everybody somehow 
 Trapped underneath the stairs 
 Dealing with the fears 
 Constantly it's silent and loud 
 I am who I am 
 There's nothing I can do 
 I try to hide it 
 And it keeps breaking through 
 I feel the world so different 
 Than any one of you 
 Remember who you are 
 There's nothing you can do 
 I'm constantly debating 
 Why I'm always playing 
 Walking around with my head down 
 I don't want to be like anyone 
 What the fuck have I have done 
 To deserve this terror somehow 
 Trapped underneath the stairs 
 Dealing with the fears 
 Constantly it's silent and loud 
 I am who I am 
 There's nothing you can do 
 I try to hide it 
 And it keeps breaking through 
 I feel this world so different 
 Than any one of you 
 Remember who you are 
 There's nothing I can do 
 I'm not like god 
 Can't hide what I am 
 Like it or not 
 I push it down, comes back again 
 The medicine stopped working long ago 
 I have a problem inside has nowhere to go 
 Inside has nowhere to go 
 Inside has nowhere to go 
 Inside has nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to fucking go 
 I am who I am 
 There's nothing you can do 
 I try to hide it 
 And it keeps breaking through 
 I feel this world so different 
 Than any one of you 
 Remember who you are 
 There's nothing I can do 
 You're always stuck with you 
 Nothing you can do 
 You're always stuck with youWell, I wish there was someone 
 Well, I wish there was someone to love me. 
 When I used to be someone 
 And I knew there was someone that loved me. 
 As I sit here, frozen, alone 
 Even ghosts get tired and go home 
 As they crawl back under the stones. 
 And I wish it was something 
 Please tell me there's something better 
 And I wish it was something more than this 
 Saturated loneliness. 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can 
 It's just saturated loneliness. 
 Does the silence get lonely? 
 Does the silence get lonely? 
 Who knows? 
 I've been hearing it tell me 
 I've been hearing it tell me 
 Go home. 
 'Cause the freaks are playing tonight 
 They've packed up and turned out the lights. 
 And I wish it was something 
 Please tell me there's something better 
 And I wish it was something more than this 
 Saturated loneliness. 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can 
 It's just saturated loneliness. 
 And the bath water's cold 
 And this life's getting old. 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it 
 And I wish I could feel it 
 And I wish I could steal it 
 And I wish I could feel it, abduct it, corrupt it 
 But I... 
 Never can. 
 But I... 
 Never can. 
 Never can. 
 Never can. 
 Never can.It looks like it's about to begin, I'm lying down in a pool of sin now 
 So why does it look so good within? 
 Letting go, giving in 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away, go away and never come back 
 I'm gonna try to dive right in, I'm gonna fight until I win now 
 I'm rotting down in a pool of sin 
 Letting go, giving in 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away, go away and never come back 
 Never come back, never come back 
 Go away and never come back 
 Go away, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you want 
 Fuck you, go away, go away and never come back 
 Never come back, never come backWhat's it gonna be today? 
 Keep chipping at my soul, and why must it disobey? 
 The only thing I loathe 
 How many times a day must I die? 
 Nothing's gonna work today 
 I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way 
 It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won 
 I'm done 
 Have I been lead astray? 
 Blaming the righteous, what do you think they'd say? 
 Attacking the altar 
 How many times a day must I die? 
 Nothing's gonna work today 
 I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way 
 It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won 
 I'm done 
 I'm done 
 I'm done with faceless feelings 
 I'm done with anything 
 I'm done trying to support you and sacrificing everything 
 Everything, everything 
 How many times a day must I die? 
 Nothing's gonna work today 
 I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way 
 It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won 
 I'm done
