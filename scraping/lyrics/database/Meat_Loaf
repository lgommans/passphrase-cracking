Whatever happened to Saturday Night 
 When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright 
 It don't seem the same since cosmic light 
 Came into my life, I thought I was divine 
 I used to drive around with a chick who'd go 
 And listen to the music on the radio 
 A saxophone was blowing on a rock 'n' roll show 
 You climbed in the back seat 
 Really had a good time 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 My head used to swim from the perfume I smelt 
 My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt 
 I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt 
 She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine 
 Get back in front, put some hair oil on 
 Buddy Holly was singing his very last song 
 With your arms around you girl you try to sing along 
 You felt pretty good, woo 
 Really had a good time 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and roll 
 Hot patootie, bless my soul 
 I really love that rock and rollI'm not afraid to show you who I am 
 And I am not ashamed of my life 
 Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road 
 I've always felt your heat in my bones 
 With every step I rise and fall 
 With everything to gain I end up losing it all 
 When the darkness gets in 
 I scream out and your light sets me free 
 I'm not afraid of the past no more 
 I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good 
 I used to dance to the devil's beat 
 If I could bust into hell I would 
 I'm not afraid to shed all my skin 
 I'm not afraid of the faults you see 
 I'm tearing down these walls right now 
 They're comin' down 'cause I believe 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 The way that you're leading me home like that 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 I'm not afraid when they kick me down 
 I'm not afraid when I start to bleed 
 I'm not afraid if I live or die 
 I'm not afraid 'cause I believe 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 The way that you're leading me home like that 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 And I wish that I could give you something in return 
 For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned 
 For reaching out to help me cross the bridges that I burned 
 And in the end you'll finally see 
 That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can 
 I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need 
 I'm not afraid of the the truth no more 
 I'm not afraid of the lies I hid 
 I'm not afraid of the price of my sins 
 I curse the day for the wrongs I did 
 I'm not afraid of the things you know 
 I'm just a book for the world to read 
 My final words on the final page 
 Will be your name 'cause I believe 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 The way that you're leading me home like that 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 Your heart is kind, mine's painted black 
 The way you forgive me and just take me back 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 The way that you're leading me home like that 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
 Your heart is kind, mine's painted black 
 The way you forgive me and just take me back 
 Your love is blind, blind as a bat...They say you never come home 
 Boy you been driving too fast 
 When you gonna shape up 
 How long is this gonna last 
 You may be laughin' today 
 But listen to some good advice 
 Take a look at tomorrow in a workin' man's weary eyes 
 You gotta pick a career 
 Go for the gold 
 Smile for the camera 
 Do what you're told 
 Well you can take away the ladder 'cause I ain't gonna climb it 
 If there's a stairway to heaven I swear I'm gonna find it 
 Yeah there are winners and outlaws 
 And leaders and lovers 
 Behind every man in the news 
 And one thing I know is behind everyone 
 There's a boy who had nothing to lose 
 Behind every man who has somethin' to say 
 There's a boy who had nothing to prove 
 Every hero was once 
 Every villain was once 
 Just a boy with a bad attitude 
 Every hero was once 
 Every villain was once 
 Just a boy with a bad attitude 
 She says you never call 
 How come you're actin' so tough 
 You either hold me so tight 
 Or you don't hold me enough 
 Don't be afraid a' me angel 
 I ain't about to clip your wings 
 Just put your feet on the ground 
 And your arms around the real thing 
 You gotta love me for keeps 
 Feather the neat 
 Plan for the future 
 Gimmee your best 
 But we're never gonna have a normal family life 
 Steamin' up and down the speedway on the back a' your bike 
 Bad attitude 
 You got us tearin' our hair 
 Such a bad attitude 
 Boy you just don't seem to care 
 We try to lay down the rules 
 But you were born to refuse 
 What's the world gonna do with a boy like you 
 You got it bad 
 You got a bad attitudeI still dream of you wakin' up openin' your eyes 
 Like a little girl I once knew walkin' to the window 
 Lookin' down on the street 
 You walk with me and I walk with you 
 Well I thought it all over it doesn't make any sense 
 Why did it fall apart when it seemed so innocent? 
 You and I were like a light from a fallen star 
 You can't go back you can't run away from your heart 
 Don't you look at me like that 
 'Cause I fall all over again 
 And I just can't hold on to your love anymore 
 Don't you look at me like that 
 'Cause I start all over again 
 And it just can't be like it was once before 
 Don't stand there in the rain 
 Lookin' like some long lost angel? 
 You and I were like a light from a fallen star 
 You can't go back you can't run away from your heart 
 Don't stand there in the rain 
 Lookin' like some long lost angel 
 Don't you look at me like that 
 'Cause I fall all over again 
 And I just can't hold on to your love anymore 
 Don't you look at me like that 
 'Cause I start all over again 
 And it just can't be like it was once beforeI was temporarily blind by a neon dollar sign 
 It pacified my mind and whispered things are fine 
 Said, "Boy, if you wanna heal just sign this paper deal 
 You'll never have to beg, no, you'll never have to steal" 
 But when that giving tree stops giving 
 I've gotta get back to living, living like I did before 
 With a mattress on the floor and no food in my kitchen 
 I gotta get back to living like I did before 
 Living like I did before 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get (whatever you can get) 
 Down in the city streets grows a giving tree 
 Out of solid stone, mortared by my bone 
 And watered by my tears, strengthened by my fears 
 It's gonna grow strong, it's gonna live long-gonna haunt me for years 
 But when that giving tree stops giving 
 I've gotta get back to living, living like I did before 
 With a mattress on the floor and no food in my kitchen 
 I gotta get back to living like I did before 
 Living like I did before 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get (whatever you can get) 
 It's beautiful fruit seems ripe at ground level 
 It's dangerous roots lead straight down to the devil 
 Lead straight down to the devil 
 Lead straight down to the devil 
 Lead straight down to the devil 
 When that giving tree stops giving 
 I've gotta get back to living, living like I did before 
 With a mattress on the floor and no food in my kitchen 
 I gotta get back to living like I did before 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 Trading one pound of gold for now ten pounds of flesh 
 You gotta sell this old soul for whatever you can get 
 (One pound of gold, ten pounds of flesh) 
 (Sell this old soul, 'ever you can get) 
 Like I did before 
 (One pound of gold, ten pounds of flesh) 
 (Sell this old soul, 'ever you can get) 
 Like I did before 
 (One pound of gold, ten pounds of flesh) 
 (Gonna sell this old soul for whatever you can get) 
 (One pound of gold, ten pounds of flesh) 
 (Gonna sell this old soul for whatever you can get) 
 Like I did before...Yeah 
 Yeah, keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel 
 Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel 
 Yeah, we're goin' to the Roadhouse 
 We're gonna have a real 
 Good time 
 Yeah, back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows 
 Yeah, back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows 
 And that's for the people 
 Who like to go down slow 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, all night long 
 Do it, honey, do it 
 You gotta roll, roll, roll 
 You gotta thrill my soul, all right 
 Roll, roll, roll, roll 
 Thrill my soul 
 You gotta beep a gunk a chucha 
 Honk konk konk

 Ashen lady, Ashen lady 
 Give up your vows, give up your vows 
 Save our city, save our city 
 Right now 
 Well, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer 
 Well, I woke up this morning, and I got myself a beer 
 The future's uncertain, and the end is always near 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, baby, roll 
 Let it roll, all night longThe skies were pure and the fields were green 
 And the sun was brighter than it's ever been 
 When I grew up with my best friend Kenny 
 We were close as any brothers that you ever knew 
 It was always summer and the future called 
 We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all 
 There was so much left to dream 
 And so much time to make it real 
 But I can still recall the sting of all 
 The tears when he was gone 
 They said he crashed and burned 
 I know I'll never learn 
 Why any boy should die so young 
 We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune 
 We got in trouble but we sure got around 
 There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark 
 I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God, it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 They are 
 They are 
 And when the sun descended and the night arose 
 I heard my father cursing everyone he knows 
 He was dangerous and drunk and defeated 
 And corroded by failure and envy and hate 
 There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze 
 Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees 
 And my father's eyes were blank 
 As he hit me again and again and again 
 I know I still believe he'd never let me leave 
 I had to run away alone 
 So many threats and fears, so many wasted years 
 Before my life became my own 
 And though the nightmares should be over 
 Some of the terrors are still intact 
 I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice 
 And then he grabs me from behind 
 And then he pulls me back 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God, it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 There was a beauty living on the edge of town 
 She always put the top up and the hammer down 
 And she taught me everything I'll ever know 
 About the mystery and the muscle of love 
 The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow 
 I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo 
 And the signs along the highway all said 
 Caution: Kids At Play 
 Those were the rights of spring and we did everything 
 There was salvation every night 
 We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn 
 But everything we tried was right 
 She used her body just like a bandage 
 She used my body just like a wound 
 I'll probably never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now 
 Just like an angel rising up from a tomb 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God, it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 Objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 She used her body just like a bandage 
 She used my body just like a wound 
 I'll never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat nowTwo A.M. with the lost and the lonely 
 Walkin' past the kids comin' back from the party 
 Smiles on their faces you remember so well how it was 
 Nights in the back of that buick that you got runnin' 
 Your baby by your side told the whole world you're comin' 
 Work so hard to do what is right 
 Believed in what you're doin' 
 But so many fights 
 Trusted too many relieved to much 
 Workin' your life to the bone 
 There's a wolf at your door 
 He wants your money, wants your soul 
 A wolf at your door 
 You give it all, he wants more 
 There's a wolf at your door 
 He says he's playin' for keeps 
 Breathin' down your neck 
 Boy it's sure hard to sleep 
 With a wolf at your door 
 They'll take it away when you're not lookin' 
 Look you in the eyes tell you how good they're doin' 
 Smiles on their faces are lies to keep you from knowin' 
 You're not guilty you are the victim 
 But you still pay for the crime 
 Don't look for truoble 
 It'll always find you in time 
 I won't be broken I'll fight 'til I drop 
 Blood runnin' hot in my veins 
 But they won't be satisfied 
 Until they take everythingHow do you bury the skull of your country? 
 How do you bury a nation of fears? 
 Where you gonna hide your love through long years of dying? 
 Give me a tombstone and a wreath of all your tears

 MERCURY! YeahIf it takes them so long, so long to say yes, 
 Why don't they just say no 
 We don't need anyone to be put to the test, 
 Why don't they let us be 
 Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right 
 Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right 
 Livin' for the right to be free 
 We needed a plan, we needed defenses, 
 They couldn't raise a smile 
 As the world looked down, they raided our senses, 
 There can be no reconcile 
 Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down 
 There was a time in our life was taken for granted, 
 It'll never come again 
 Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted, 
 They put it all to the flame 
 Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down 
 Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down 
 Burnin' down, burnin' down 
 Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down... (to fade)Look at them now 
 What do they want? 
 And what do they do now? 
 Nothing at all! 
 What do they know? 
 What do they think? 
 And who do they tell? 
 Well, no one at all! 
 Lives are truly meaningless 
 And we are busy being blessed 
 With that we can take and pocket 
 No one needs to know 
 We're is the plug and they're the socket 
 Give us the juice and we'll go 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the animals sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 How do they sleep? 
 Their lives are so tart 
 Bring me the trash collectors 
 'Cause they're nothing but trash 
 What do you expect? 
 They've got no standards 
 So we lower the bar 
 'Cause they're waiting for us 
 We'll open up Pandora's Box 
 Pandora gave her keys and locks 
 They're the big dogs waiting for their mother 
 Come to the confessional 
 So I can tell you all to bugger off 
 There's no time like now! 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the animals sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the market-place sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king... 
 And we'll do it our way 
 It's our time to play 
 We know what to say 
 They stand in our way 
 Don't stand in our way 
 No time like today... 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the anthems we sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the animals sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 Can't you hear the choir now? 
 Listen to the chosen ones sing! 
 Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells? 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king! 
 In the land of the pigs the butcher is king...You don't need to sneak in the door just come on in to the room 
 I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone 
 I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you 
 There's been no reason to move, it's been as still as a tomb 
 I needed you oh so badly tonight but I guess you had better things to do 
 I should have know that it was coming to this 
 But I must have been blind 
 I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes 
 And you still got his eyes on your mind 
 You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock 
 Now it's a quarter to 3. 
 Well whatever you got and whoever it was 
 I guess you couldn't get it from me 
 Whatever you got and whoever it was 
 I guess you couldn't get it from me 
 I know that you love me, there's no need to talk 
 I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof 
 And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress 
 I just want to get at the truth 
 I know that you love me, there's no need to talk 
 I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof 
 And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress 
 I just want to get at the truth 
 And there are so many things that I just got to know 
 You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when! 
 But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight 
 I just need some love, so turn out the lights 
 And I'll be left in the dark again 
 Left in the dark again 
 I just need some love, so turn out the lights 
 And I'll be left in the dark again 
 Left Iin the dark again 
 I just need some love, so turn out the lights 
 And I'll be left in the dark again 
 Left Iin the dark again

 But I must have been blind 
 I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes 
 And you still got his eyes on your mind 
 You swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock 
 Now it's a quarter to three. 
 Well whatever you got and whoever it was 
 I guess you couldn't get it from me 
 I guess you couldn't get it from me 
 But down in my soul - down in my soul I know 
 I know that you love me, there's no need to talk 
 I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof 
 And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress 
 I just want to get at the truth

 Left in the dark againYou like ridin' around with your big brother 
 In your uncle's custom van 
 You wanna bleach your hair so bad 
 But your Mama don't understand 
 Hangin' around by the monument 
 Dancin' to the radio 
 You got a memory even shorter than your dress 
 But there's nothing you don't know 
 Priscilla 
 Priscilla 
 Nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid 
 Priscilla 
 Priscilla 
 They're gonna kill you for what you did 
 Cuttin' class with a backstage pass 
 And always skippin' lunch 
 Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys 
 And Daddy's vodka in the punch 
 Learned how to jump start your Grandma's car 
 How to French inhale your Kools 
 And now you know that breakin' hearts 
 Is easy as breakin' the rules 
 Ya don't remember no revolution 
 You don't belong to no baby boom 
 Just you and your headphones 
 Dreamin' in your pink bedroom 
 Strong girls break the records 
 And rich girls break their nails 
 Smart girls always know by heart 
 What some girls always fail 
 Bad little girls grow up to be good 
 And good girls finish last 
 But crazy girls don't care how they grow up 
 As long as they grow up fastGood girls go to heaven 
 But the bad girls go everywhere 
 When the wind is howling through your window pane 
 It's not the only pain of the night 
 You're burning up in your bed, you got a fever of love 
 And there's not an anti-body in sight 
 Hey Jenny, Jenny, why are you crying? 
 There's a beauty of a moon in the sky 
 But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life 
 You never lift your head and look so high 
 You don't have a lot, but it's all that you've got 
 And you can turn it into more than it seems 
 Just give it a shot, 
 Fantasize every movement 
 And imagine every inch of your dream 
 No one said it had to be real 
 But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now 
 It ain't right, it ain't fair 
 Castles fall in the sand and we fade in the air 
 And the good girls go to heaven, 
 But the bad girls go everywhere 
 Good girls go to heaven, 
 But the bad girls go everywhere 
 Somebody told me so, 
 Somebody told me now I know 
 Every night in my prayer, 
 I'll be praying that the 
 Good girls go to heaven, 
 But the bad girls go everywhere 
 When the sweat is sizzling on your skin in the dark 
 And you're desperate now for somewhere to turn 
 Every muscle in rebellion, every nerve is on edge 
 And every limb has been erotically burned 
 Hey Johnny, Johnny, why are you shaking? 
 When a boy should do whatever he can 
 You've been nothing but an angel every day of your life 
 And now you wonder what it's like to be damned 
 You don't have a lot, but it's all that you've got 
 And you can turn it into more than it seems 
 Just give it a shot, 
 Fantasize every movement 
 And imagine every inch of your dream 
 No one said it had to be real 
 But it's gotta be something you've been wanting to feel now 
 It ain't right, it ain't fair 
 Castles fall in the sand and we fade in the air 
 And the good boys go to heaven, 
 But the bad boys go everywhere 
 Good boys go to heaven, 
 But the bad boys go everywhere 
 Somebody told me so, 
 Somebody told me now I know 
 Every night in my prayer, 
 I'll be praying that the 
 Good boys go to heaven, 
 But the bad boys go everywhere 
 Every time I try and dream you, 
 I can't believe how hard it's been to 
 Conjure up your face 
 And trace your body in the air 
 All the seconds go on forever, 
 But the thirds and fourth ones are even better 
 Everytime I do it just a little bit longer 
 Everytime I dream, 
 It's just a little bit stronger than real life 
 Good girls go to heaven, 
 Bad girls go everywhereAnother night sleepless 
 I don't want to feel this 
 Nothing can stop this pain 
 Trying to get to 
 A time I forget you 
 Still tangled in yesterday 
 It's so easy for you 
 To feel nothing for me 
 Did you ever feel anything? 
 I want you to cry over me 
 Die over me 
 Even for a moment 
 Even for a moment 
 I want you to hurt over me 
 Feel what I feel 
 I want you to cry over, die over me 
 Baby, just one time 
 I want your heart broken 
 Some sign of emotion 
 I want to see the tears tumble down 
 Show me I meant something 
 And that you feel nothing 
 But your world crashing to the ground 
 It's so easy for you 
 To forget about me 
 Did I ever mean anything? 
 I want you to cry over me 
 Die over me 
 Even for a moment 
 Even for a moment 
 I want you to hurt over me 
 Feel what I feel 
 I want you to cry over, die over me 
 Baby, just one time 
 (Cry - cry - cry) 
 But did you feel something? 
 Did we mean nothing at all? 
 I want you to cry over, cry over me 
 Die over me 
 Even for a moment 
 Even for a moment 
 I want you to hurt over me 
 Feel what I feel 
 Even for a moment 
 Oh why, can't you just cry over, die over me 
 Baby, why can't you hurt like I do like I hurt over you 
 Can't you cry over, die over me 
 Baby, just one time 
 I want you to cry over, die over me 
 Baby, want you to fall on your knees 
 Baby, crawl back to me 
 Want you to cry over, die over me 
 Baby, just one time 
 (Cry - cry - cry)...Someone told me long ago 
 There's a calm before the storm, I know 
 And it's been coming for some time 
 When it's over, so they say 
 It'll rain a sunny day, I know 
 Shining down like water 
 I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
 I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
 Coming down on a sunny day? 
 Ahhhhh 
 Oh yeah 
 Yesterday and days before 
 Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know 
 Been that way for all my time 
 'Til forever, on it goes 
 Through the circle fast and slow, I know 
 And it can't stop, I wonder 
 I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
 I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
 Coming down on a sunny day? 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain? 
 I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
 Coming down on a sunny day? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 Have you ever seen the rain? 
 ...Boy: 
 There ain't no hidden treasure 
 In this pot of gold, you see: 
 Ain't no way you're going to make 
 No silky purse outta me 
 Girl: 
 Well I'm never ever gonna change your ways 
 I'll take you as you are 
 But you got something that I want 
 And that's one way to go 
 Both: 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet 
 Boy: 
 Yeah, I told you that I loved ya 
 Right from the very start 
 Now don't you make me sorry girl 
 That'll open up my heart 
 Girl: 
 Well I know that I'm no angel 
 Can say my first time out 
 But you can count on what I've got 
 'Cause what I've got's a lot--don't you know: 
 Both: 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet 
 (baby baby baby) 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet 
 (how ya doin' now?) 
 Girl: 
 When it's cold I want it hot 
 I've always wanted what it's not 
 But when it comes to loving you 
 I'm yours no matter what you do 
 Boy: 
 Oh, you're my baby and I'm your man 
 This is not an angel's plan 
 Girl: 
 You're not too skinny-not too fat 
 Loving you is where it's at 
 Both: 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet 
 (baby baby baby) 
 What you see is what you get 
 And you ain't seen nothing yet... 
 (repeat and fade)I... I fall for everything 
 Under the sun, over the moon 
 Coming undone, broken in two 
 You... you fall for anything 
 Living the lie like all the rest 
 Walking the line out on the edge 
 Every saint is a sinner someday 
 No one is safe 
 You can fall from grace in so many ways 
 One step forward, two back 
 You can't run away from that empty space 
 You will find your place 
 When you lose your way 
 We all will fall from grace 
 I... feel like I never land 
 Out of the grey, into the black 
 Wasting away, starting to crack 
 Life... life is just history 
 Learning to die, reaching for stars 
 Coming to life, wearing the scars 
 Every saint is a sinner someday 
 No one is safe 
 You can fall from grace in so many ways 
 One step forward, two back 
 You can't run away from that empty space 
 You will find your place 
 When you lose your way 
 We all will fall from grace 
 And it's a sweet salvation 
 When you know you've reached the bottom 
 And you can finally pick yourself back up 
 Fall from grace, in so many ways 
 One step forward, two back 
 You can't run away from that empty space 
 You will find your place 
 When you lose your way 
 We all will fall 
 We all will fall 
 We all will fall... from grace45 second of ecstasy 
 How it comes right back to me 
 Fly so high and feel so free 
 45 seconds of ecstasy 
 45 seconds of ecstasy 
 Cuts right through the complexity 
 When I feel him right next to me 
 45 seconds of ecstasyWasted youth! Wasted youth! 
 I know that I will never be politically correct 
 And I don't give a damn about my lack of etiquette 
 As far as I'm concerned, the world could still be flat 
 And if the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back 
 If the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back 
 Who am I? Why am I here? Forget the questions, someone gimme another beer 
 What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of it all? 
 You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl 
 You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl 
 So sign up all you raw recruits, throw away those designer suits 
 You got your weapons cocked, your targets in your sights 
 There's a party raging somewhere in the world 
 You gotta serve your country, gotta service your girl 
 You're all enlisted in the armies of the night 
 And I ain't in it for the power, and I ain't in it for the health 
 I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all 
 And I sure ain't in it for the wealth 
 But I'm in it till it's over and I just can't stop 
 If you wanna get it done, you gotta do it yourself 
 And I like my music like I like my life 
 Everything louder than everything else, everything louder than everything else 
 Everything louder than everything else, everything louder than everything else 
 Everything louder than everything else, everything louder than everything else 
 Wasted youth! Wasted youth! Wasted youth! Wasted youth! 
 They got a file on me and it's a mile long 
 And they say that they got all of the proof 
 That I'm just another case of arrested development 
 And just another wasted youth 
 They say that I'm in need of some radical discipline 
 They say I gotta face the truth 
 That I'm just another case of arrested development 
 And just another wasted youth 
 They say I'm wild and I'm reckless, I should be acting my age 
 I'm an impressionable child in a tumultuous world 
 And they say I'm at a difficult stage 
 But it seems to me to the contrary 
 Of all the crap they're going to put on the page 
 That a wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age 
 If you want my views of history then there's something you should know 
 The three men I admire most are Curly, Larry and Moe! 
 If you don't worry 'bout the future, sooner or later it's the past 
 And if they say the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back 
 If the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back 
 So sign up all you raw recruits, throw away all those two-bit suits 
 You got your weapons cocked, your targets in your sights 
 There's a party raging somewhere in the world 
 You gotta serve your country, gotta service your girl 
 You're all inducted in the armies of the night 
 And I ain't in it for the power, and I ain't in it for the health 
 I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all 
 And I sure ain't in it for the wealth 
 But I'm in it till it's over and I just can't stop 
 If you wanna get it done, you gotta fight for yourself 
 And I like my music like I like my life 
 Everything louder than everything else (repeats out)From the minute I turned and laid eyes on you 
 I had no eyes of my own I was blind to the world- 
 You were to good to be true but you were something to see- 
 So very young and alone and still I don't believe 
 The way you turned on me now where's the girl that I knew? 
 I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love 
 You gave me nothing but trouble- man, I was such a fool 
 You gave me nothing at all- now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel- now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me - let me count the ways 
 How many hours in how many days 
 How does it amuse you - let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking how many games 
 How do you abuse me - let me count the ways 
 How many hours in how many days 
 How does it amuse you - let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking how many games 
 You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack 
 Go on and take all your stuff - don't even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life - 
 But I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close 
 And then you'd hold me so tight and in the wink of an eye 
 You used to give me it all and with a kiss in the darkness 
 You'd deliver the light 
 And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud 
 I know you're laughing at me oh ain't it funny and sad 
 The way I fell for your lies the way I fell into love 
 And then begged to be free 
 You gave me nothing at all - now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel - now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me - let me count the ways 
 How many hours in how many days 
 How does it amuse you - let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking how many games 
 You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack 
 Go on and take all your stuff - don't even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life - 
 But I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach 
 They're dreamin' of boys and just out of reach 
 Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track 
 They're glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs 
 Bless all the girls in gangs on the street 
 They're looking for danger and they're holding their piece 
 Bless all the girls staying late after school 
 They're playing with fire and they're playing it cool 
 And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance 
 They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance 
 Bless all the girls who are always alone 
 They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone 
 Bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights 
 And bless all the girls who know what love is about 
 They try not to cry and then they try to put out 
 And bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights 
 And bless all the girls who know what love is about 
 They try not to cry and then they try to put out 
 Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met 
 But damn you and curse you after all that you've done 
 You're the one girl I'll never forget 
 You're the one girl I'll never forget 
 Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do 
 But damn me and curse me for still needing you 
 And I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come backThere have been many sightings 
 Of love in truth 
 The skeptic in me longs for 
 To see of love some proof 
 Only for you does this happen 
 Only for you do I care 
 Love is not real 
 Love is a hoax 
 It's just a dream 
 I've had so many nights alone 
 Love is not here 
 Love is somewhere else 
 It's somewhere far 
 No man I've ever known's 
 Come close 
 It can be vicious, heartless, 
 Dire and cruel 
 In spite of my mind, my heart longs 
 To find fire and fuel 
 Only for you do I do this 
 Only for you do I care 
 Love is not real 
 Love is a hoax 
 It's just a dream 
 I've had so many nights alone 
 Love is not here 
 Love is somewhere else 
 I's somewhere far 
 No man I've ever known's 
 Come close 
 My girlfriend doesn't want 
 To know me 
 And my friends think 
 I've lost the plot 
 I have become a liability 
 I got to do something 
 But I don't know what 
 I'm hearing voices and 
 I can't see straight 
 I think I might be going insane 
 Can't make my own decisions 
 And I just can't wait 
 To mess it all up again 
 I never thought that 
 I would succeed 
 Beyond the wildest dreams 
 I've ever dreamt 
 But everything's become so 
 Hackneyed 
 Familiarity only breeds contempt 
 I'm ruining your life 
 I'm bored with mine 
 I'm acting like I couldn't care less 
 Another bottle and another line 
 Another strange to undress 
 Next time you stab me in the back 
 You'd better do it to my face 
 Next time you stab me in the back 
 You'd better do it to my face 
 Next time you stab me in the back 
 You'd better do it to my face 
 When you forget 
 What you cannot forgive 
 The terms are so much easier to 
 Come to with 
 When we look at what 
 We're going through 
 And desaturate 
 Until everything is simple 
 Love or hate 
 Lover or hate 
 I have been searching my soul 
 I've seen the brightest star 
 I've seen the blackest hole 
 I've found a way to cope with every 
 Twist of fate 
 Now everything is simple 
 Love or hate 
 Love or hate 
 Next time you stab me in the back 
 You'd better do it to my face 
 And when that love comes crawling 
 Back to me to say 
 I've been away 
 Now please let me stay with the 
 No way 
 Never again will I do this 
 Never again will I care 
 Love is not real 
 Love is a hoax 
 It's just a dream 
 I've had so many nights alone 
 Love is not here 
 Love is somewhere else 
 It's just a dream 
 I've had so many night's alone 
 Love is not here 
 Love is somewhere else 
 It's somewhere far 
 No man I've ever known's 
 Come closeI want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 But can you trust me? 
 Yes, you know, you could 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Don't waste your time 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Just leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 I want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 Now take a chance, momma 
 You know, you should 
 Trust your instincts and let me in 
 Just be my ride and I'll be my friend 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 You're wastin' your time 
 The boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Leave him alone 
 'Cause it's just bad news 
 I want you so hard 
 I want you so good

 The boy's bad newsWell, I remember every little thing 
 As if it happened only yesterday 
 Parking by the lake 
 And there was not another car in sight 
 And I never had a girl 
 Looking any better than you did 
 And all the kids at school 
 They were wishing they were me that night 
 And now our bodies are oh so close and tight 
 It never felt so good, it never felt so right 
 And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Come on! Hold on tight! 
 Well, come on! Hold on tight! 
 Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night 
 I can see paradise by the dashboard light 
 Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed 
 'Cause we were barely seventeen 
 And we were barely dressed 
 Ain't no doubt about it 
 Baby, got to go out and shout it 
 Ain't no doubt about it 
 We were doubly blessed 
 'Cause we were barely seventeen 
 And we were barely dressed 
 Baby don'cha hear my heart? 
 You got it drowning out the radio 
 I've been a-waiting so long 
 For you to come along and have some fun 
 And I gotta let you know 
 No, you're never gonna regret it 
 So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise 
 It'll feel all right 
 Well, I wanna make your motor run 
 And now our bodies are oh so close and tight 
 It never felt so good, it never felt so right 
 And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 Come on! Hold on tight! 
 Well, come on! Hold on tight! 
 Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night 
 I can see paradise by the dashboard light 
 Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night 
 Paradise by the dashboard light 
 You got to do what you can 
 And let Mother Nature do the rest 
 Ain't no doubt about it 
 We were doubly blessed 
 'Cause we were barely seventeen 
 And we were barely 
 We're gonna go all the way tonight 
 We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night 
 We're gonna go all the way tonight 
 We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night 
 We're gonna go all the way tonight 
 We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night 
 We're gonna go all the way tonight 
 We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night 
 Okay, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here. Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth. There's the wind-up, and there it is: a line shot up the middle. Look at him go, this boy can really fly. He's rounding first and really turning it on now. He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second. The ball is bobbled out in the center and here comes the throw and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head-first, here he comes... he's out. No, wait, safe! Safe at second base! This kid really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the plate. Here's the pitch, and he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third. Here's the throw... It's in the dirt, safe at third. Holy cow, stolen base. He's taking a pretty big lead out there, almost daring them to try and pick him off. The pitcher glances over, winds-up and it's bunted. Bunted down the third base line and the suicide squeeze is on. Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close. Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate. Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it... 
 Stop right there! 
 I gotta know right now

 Let me sleep on it! 
 Will you love me forever? 
 I couldn't take it any longer 
 Lord! I was crazed 
 And when the feeling came upon me 
 Like a tidal wave 
 I started swearing to my God 
 And on my mother's grave 
 That I would love you till the end of time 
 I swore I would love you till the end of time 
 So now I'm praying for the end of time 
 To hurry up and arrive 
 'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you 
 I don't think that I can really survive 
 I'll never break my promise or forget my vow 
 But God only knows what I can do right now 
 I'm praying for the end of time 
 That's all that I can do, ooh, ooh 
 Praying for the end of time 
 So I can end my time with you 
 And it was long ago and it was far away 
 And it was so much better than it is today 
 It was long ago and it was far away 
 It never felt so good, it never felt so right 
 And it was so much better than it is today 
 And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 It was long ago and it was far away 
 It never felt so good, it never felt so right 
 And it was so much better than it is today 
 And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife 
 It was long ago and it was far away 
 It never felt so good, it never felt so right 
 And it was so much better than it is today 
 And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knifeThe locusts are singing, the sun is red. 
 It's gotten so late somehow. 
 There's gonna be trouble, you know what they said. 
 We should have been home by now. 
 The thunder is rolling, the sky is black. 
 It's gotten so dark somehow. 
 There's gonna be danger, God I wish we were back. 
 We should have been home by now. 
 We should have been home by now. 
 No matter what they tell us, no matter what they do. 
 No matter what they teach us, what we believe is true. 
 No matter what they call us, however they attack. 
 No matter where they take us, we'll find our own way back. 
 I can't deny what I believe, I can't be what I'm not. 
 I know I'll love forever, I know -. 
 No matter what, if only tears were laughter. 
 If only night was day, if only prayers were answered. 
 Then we would hear God say. 
 No matter what they tell you, no matter what they do. 
 No matter what they teach you, what you believe is true. 
 And I will keep you safe and strong, and sheltered from the 
 Storm. 
 No matter where it's barren, A dream is being born. 
 No matter who they follow, No matter where they lead. 
 No matter how they judge us, I'll be everyone you need. 
 No matter if the sun don't shine, or if the skies are blue. 
 No matter what the ending, my life began with you. 
 I can't deny what I believe, I can't be what I'm not. 
 I know this love's forever, I know. 
 No matter what. 
 I can't deny what I believe, I can't be what I'm not. 
 I know this love's forever, that's all that matters now. 
 No matter what. 
 The thunder is rolling, the sky is black. 
 It's gotten so dark somehow. 
 There's gonna be danger, God I wish I were back. 
 We should have been home by now. 
 We should have been home by now.Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny 
 I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker side 
 Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road 
 But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load 
 I get up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the night 
 Oh, I testify 
 I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie 
 And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight 
 Could you be the salvation 'cause I never felt like this before 
 And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the morning 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the night 
 Oh, I testify 
 On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night 
 Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight 
 And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow 
 And a sweet young thing called out my name 
 And this is how it goes, she says ... 
 'Go boy, can you hear them? Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?' 
 And I got down on my knees 
 I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 Up from the ground and I'm falling back down 
 Up from the ground and I testify 
 Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide 
 All the pain that you restrain keeps buildings up deep inside 
 If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore 
 You've got to walk before you run 
 See the night before dawn 
 Before you pull yourself off the floor 
 I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the evening 
 Up from the ground in the middle of the night 
 Oh, I testifyNever callin', unanswered letters 
 How you been, feelin' better? 
 Never lookin', but you're hearin' 
 Never speakin', but you're feeling 
 All the silence, and its wounding 
 You're not healing, just conceding 
 Play the game, play the game 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs red 
 Don't roll over, don't play dead 
 We're all livin' on the razor's edge 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs ruby red 
 We're all victims of the razor's edge 
 All the rules don't mean a thing 
 They're wasting time, the mem'ries sting 
 Keep your image, plant that smile 
 Answer questions, don't let on 
 Make up stories all put on, that's your life 
 Your life is gone 
 (Play the game) 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs red 
 Don't roll over, don't play dead 
 We're all livin' on the razor's edge 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs ruby red 
 We're all victims of the razor's edge 
 You see you're losing yet you still try 
 The game just a 'watches your life go by 
 You're playin' 
 WHY?! 
 Oh, play the game 
 You see you're losing yet you still try 
 The game just a 'watches your life go by 
 You're playin' well 
 Oh, you're playing the game 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs red 
 Don't roll over, don't play dead 
 We're all livin' on the razor's edge 
 Oh, brother to brother 
 All the blood runs ruby red 
 We're all victims of the razor's edgeBaby, I think it's over 
 The end is finally near 
 Don't wanna talk about it anymore 
 I see it all so clear 
 So pack your bags 
 And move on out 
 There ain't nothing for you here 
 I think you know it's over too 
 So why not disappear? 
 Wait a minute, baby 
 What's that you say? 
 You really don't think it's fair 
 To send you outside 
 Into the cold, cold night 
 Oh, you poor, poor girl 
 Well, I don't really care 
 'Cause you've been cold to me so long 
 I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears 
 So pack your bags and move on out 
 There ain't nothin' for you here ... 
 Baby, I know it's over 
 I got a last idea 
 Don't want to leave you empty-handed 
 Well, I agree that wouldn't be fair 
 Take along a little something to remember me by 
 A little something to show that I cared 
 Step right up, you poor little girl 
 Step right up, you poor little girl

 I don't blame you now 
 'Cause I know you really tried 
 Take my soul 
 You can have my mind 
 But you're never gonna get your hands on my love 
 'Cause it's mine, mine - all mine 
 Take my master 
 You can have my slave 
 When I'm dead or buried alive 
 You can always take my grave 
 Take my body 
 Well, I know you really think it's fine 
 But you're never gonna get your hands on my love 
 Because it's mine, mine - all mine 
 Tell me right, now 
 Who's playing this game 
 And which side do I choose? 
 I'm going down, down 
 And I'm spinning around 
 Is there anyone I can accuse? 
 What are the odds? 
 Or do I win or lose? 
 Oh baby 
 Please, sir, by the way, sir 
 May I be excused? 
 Take my sorrow 
 I'm running out of joy 
 When you're tired of playing with yourself 
 You can always take my toys 
 Take my baby 
 Show her a real good time 
 You always were a super dad 
 But as a lover you were less than fine 
 Take my jewels 
 Well, I know you love to see them shine 
 But you're never gonna get your hands on my love 
 Because it's mine, mine - all mine 
 Tell me right, now 
 Who's playing this game 
 And which side do I choose? 
 I'm going down, down 
 And I'm spinning around 
 Is there anyone I can accuse? 
 What are the odds? 
 Or do I win or lose? 
 Oh baby 
 Please, sir, by the way, sir 
 May I be excused?

 Take your souvenirs 
 Step right up, you poor, poor girl.Under your protective wing I walked into the light 
 And a thousand angry demons up and took flight 
 I went running through the fields with that fever in my veins 
 And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name 
 Above my head, all in red, I could see you 
 Leaning down on me you said you're not running out 
 You said you're leaving now 
 I will find you 
 There is no way out 
 I'll keep tracking you down in the still of the night 
 Mine forever, mine forever 
 Don't leave your mark on me 
 No need to reply 
 I'm not staying 
 I'm just killing time 
 Don't leave your mark on me 
 There's no need to reply 
 I'm not staying 
 This nightmare never ends 
 Memories of absent friends 
 Masked illusions stare at me 
 Point the finger silently 
 Stand accused of a dark affair 
 There's a ghost in here somewhere 
 There's a ghost in here somewhere 
 Mistress of the darkness, accomplice of the night 
 A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside 
 And something led the way through I couldn't see its face 
 And a voice from deep inside me seemed to get out of this place 
 In my head, all was said as the jailor turned the key on me 
 He said you're not running out, he said you're not leaving now 
 He said there's no way, there is no way 
 Don't leave your mark on meSomewhere some girl is crazy 
 And some boy's half out of his head 
 Somewhere somebody's fearless 
 And someone won't wind up dead 
 Somewhere two hearts are pounding 
 And they don't care what's correct 
 Somewhere somebody's fallin' in love 
 Without a background check... 
 Son, I'm Mr P.C. believe you and me 
 I'm the ultimate king of correct 
 And if you wanna make it you gotta make her take it 
 As a sign of your deep respect 
 If you're gonna do it you gotta see through it 
 To the heavenly trust that it is 
 Then you can call her a slut 
 And you can call her a slave 
 If you remember to call her Ms...

 Used to be sex was a fine hello 
 Now the rubber meets the road 
 Ya say "Girl, you're a beauty" but I'm no beast 
 I got a little contract right here 
 See, you can slam on the brakes 
 Anytime you got the stick 
 Even if we're in fourth gear

 Gettin' it on videotape 
 Got a shrink in the bed, Lord, sittin' on the headboard 
 Swearin' that we both got raped...

 Somewhere somebody's falling in love...She thought she had the only key 
 She thought you only opened up to her 
 Well you see 
 I don't know why you call it love 
 She thought she was the brightest light 
 But someone else was lighting up your life 
 What I think 
 I don't know why you call it love 
 I'm not suspicious 
 No not me 
 But I'm not blind and I'd have to be not to see

 (Fade out)From the very first moment I saw you 
 I knew our love would be so strong 
 And from the very first moment I kissed you 
 I knew our joy would last so long 
 And then I saw you making love to my best friend 
 I didn't know whatever to say 
 I saw you making love to my best friend 
 So I looked him right in his eyes and I said 
 Listen boy 
 Why don't you take some more, it's what you came for 
 And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve 
 Have yourself a ball with my good woman 
 Why don't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve 
 Why don't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve 
 When I saw you hanging round the truck stop 
 Shining like an angel in the night 
 And when I saw you crying like a baby 
 I knew you'd have to be my wife 
 And then I saw you making love to my best friend 
 I didn't know whatever to say 
 I saw you making love to my best friend 
 So I looked him right in his eyes and I said 
 Listen boy 
 Why don't you take some more, it's what you came for 
 And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve 
 Go on have yourself a ball with my good woman 
 Why don't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve 
 Why don't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve 
 Now I think I'm going to have to leave you 
 Because I'm feeling much too weak to share 
 And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces 
 The flavor that I crave is no longer there 
 And then I saw you making love to two of my best friends 
 I didn't know whatever to say 
 I saw you making love to a group of my best friends 
 So I looked them right in his eyes and I said 
 Listen here, group 
 Why don't you take some more, it's what you came for 
 And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve 
 Have yourself a ball with my good woman 
 Why don't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve 
 Why don't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve 
 Why don't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserveI want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 It's all or nothin' 
 And nothin's all I ever get, 
 Every time I turn it I burn it up and burn it out 
 There's always something, 
 There's always something going wrong. 
 That's the only guarantee, that's what this is all about. 
 It's a never ending attack. 
 Everything's a lie and that's a fact 
 Life is a lemon and I want my money back! 
 And all the morons, 
 And all the stooges with their coins, 
 Their the ones who make the rules, it's not a game it's just a rout 
 There's desperation, (there's desperation) 
 There's desperation in the air. 
 It leaves a stain on all your clothes and no detergent gets it out. 
 And we're always slippin' through the cracks. 
 Then the movie's over, fade to black. 
 Then the movie's over, fade to black 
 Life is a lemon and I want my money back 
 What about love? 
 It's defective! 
 It's always breakin' in half. 
 What about sex? 
 It's defective! 
 It's never built to really last. 
 What about your family? 
 It's defective! 
 All the batteries are shot. 
 What about your friends? 
 Their defective! 
 All the parts are out of stock. 
 What about your god? 
 It's defective! 
 They forgot the warranty. 
 What about your town? 
 It's defective! 
 It's a dead end street to me. 
 What about your school? 
 It's defective! 
 It's a pack of useless lies. 
 What about your work? 
 It's defective! 
 It's a crock and then you die. 
 What about hope? 
 It's defective! 
 It's corroded and decayed. 
 What about faith? 
 It's defective! 
 It's tattered and itI was nothing but a lonely boy 
 Looking out for something new 
 And you were nothing but a lonely girl 
 But you were something 
 Something like a dream come true 
 I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block 
 When I played my guitar, I made the canyons rock 
 But every Saturday Night 
 I felt the fever grow 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 And in the middle of a steamy night 
 I'm tossing in my sleep 
 And in the middle of a red-eyed dream 
 I see you coming 
 Coming on to give it to me 
 Well, I was out on the prowl, down by the edge of the track 
 And like a son of a jackal, I'm the leader of the pack 
 But every Saturday night 
 I felt the fever grow 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 Oh baby I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest 
 I've been stalking you and tracking you down 
 Cruising up and down the main drag all night long 
 We could be standing at the top of the world 
 Instead of sinking further down in the mud 
 You and me 'round about midnight 
 You and me 'round about midnight 
 Someone got to draw first, draw first 
 Someone got to draw first blood 
 Someone got to draw first blood 
 Ooh, I got to draw first blood 
 Ooh, I got to draw first blood 
 Well, I was out on the prowl, down by the edge of the track 
 And like a son of a jackal, I'm the leader of the pack 
 But every Saturday night 
 I felt the fever grow 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 Do ya know what it's like 
 All revved up with no place to go? 
 I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy 
 Looking out for something to do 
 And you were nothing but a lonely all-American girl 
 But you were something like a dream come true 
 I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block 
 And when I played my guitar, I made the canyons rock 
 But every Saturday Night 
 I felt the fever grow 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 All revved up with no place to go 
 All revved up with no place to goI'd never tell you one lie, I'd never let you down 
 I'd never leave, I'd be the one who'd always be around 
 Baby give me a chance 
 I'd pull the sun down from the sky to light your darkest night 
 I wouldn't let one drop of rain fall down into your life 
 Put your heart in my hands 
 Baby, believe me I could never do you wrong 
 And I would never paint your world blue 
 And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind 
 I might be crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Do anything you asked me to 
 I'd even sell my soul for you 
 I'd do it all for you 
 If you'd just believe in me 
 Just take a look in my eyes, you'll see a love that's blind 
 Just take a hold of my hand, I'll take you to paradise 
 Ain't a star that's too far 
 Your every wish will be a wish that I will make come true 
 And if you want the moon I swear I'll bring it down for you 
 Let me into your heart 
 Believe me baby, got your name carved on my soul 
 'Cause you're the only one that I'll give it too 
 Go let'em say that I'm a fool to act this way 
 'Cause if I'm crazy, I'm just crazy 'bout you 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Do anything you ask me to 
 I'll even sell my soul for you 
 I'll do it all for you 
 If you just believe in me 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Move mountains if you want me to 
 I'd walk across the fire for you 
 I'd walk on the wild for you 
 If you'd just believe in me 
 And you will never see a day I'll ever break your heart 
 You'll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far 
 I'll show you heaven every second that you're in my arms 
 Baby I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Move mountains if you want me to 
 I'd walk across the fire for you 
 I'd walk on the wild for you 
 If you'd just believe in me 
 I'd walk on the wild for you 
 Move mountains if you want me to 
 I'd walk across the fire for you 
 Do anything you ask me to 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Do anything you ask me to 
 I'll even sell my soul for you 
 I'll do it all for you 
 If you just believe in me 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truth 
 Move mountains if you want me to 
 I'd walk across the fire for you 
 I'd walk on the wild for you 
 If you'd just believe in me 
 I'd lie for you and that's the truthAnother New York waltz at four A.M. 
 In the canyons lost at night 
 The city's just a jail for me 
 Full of high rise prison walls 
 And I'm riding through the darkness 
 'Cause I know there's life within 
 And I'm searching through the shadows 
 Just to find that light again 
 Keep Driving (Keep Driving) 
 Let the meter run 
 Keep Driving (Keep Driving) 
 Oh the night's not really done 
 Keep Driving 
 And I'm hanging on a memory and I feel it in the air 
 I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets but I know I'll find you 
 There 
 And oh Lord, you look so pretty but you can see it in my eyes 
 And just before my tear will fall oh you smile and get inside 
 It seems so real until the light turns green 
 Don't wake me up don't ruin this dream 
 Don't take me from my scene 
 I can't go home don't take me home 
 I can't go home alone 
 They don't tell you when the music stops 
 Or how the movie ends 
 Is it too late once the feeling's gone 
 To back it up and start it all again? 
 Oh Lord you look so pretty 
 But you can see it in my eyes 
 And just before my tear will fall 
 Oh you smile and get inside 
 Keep Driving (Keep Driving)

 Have you a breath to breathe? 
 And have you veins that bleed? 
 Have you a brain that dreams?

 But you'll never hide away from me 
 The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark 
 And we may lose everything in the wind 
 But the Northern Lights are burning 
 And they're giving off sparks 
 I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin 
 You know I'm onto your scent 
 We're near the end of the chase 
 Take a look out your window and I'll be there in the night 
 Your love is so close that I can almost taste it 
 The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark 
 And we may lose everything in the wind 
 But the Northern Lights are burning 
 And they're giving off sparks 
 I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin 
 You've been living your life like a girl in a cage 
 And you whisper when I want you to shout 
 And I wonder why you wanna go on sleeping 
 When there's nothing left to dream about 
 But you better remember 
 If it's something I want then it's something I need 
 I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed 
 If it's something I want then it's something I need 
 I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed 
 And I know that I'm gonna be like this forever 
 I'm never gonna be what I should 
 And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while 
 But I know that I'll be bad for good 
 I know that I'll be bad for good 
 I know that I'll be bad for good 
 Your eyes are darker than sin 
 And I've been watching them glow 
 Take a chance on a promise and a roll of the dice 
 Put your foot on the gas, let it go, let it go, let it go 
 You've been living your life like a girl in a cage 
 And you whisper when I want you to shout 
 And wonder why you wanna go on sleeping 
 When there's nothing left to dream about 
 But you better remember 
 If it's something I want then it's something I need 
 I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed 
 If it's something I want then it's something I need 
 I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed 
 And I know that I'm gonna be like this forever 
 I'm never gonna be what I should 
 And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while 
 And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while 
 And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while 
 But I know that I'll be bad for good 
 I know that I'll be bad for good 
 I know that I'll be bad for good 
 I know that I'll be bad for good 
 Bad for good 
 Bad for good 
 For the good of some thrills on a long frigid night 
 For the good of the fire in your soul 
 For the good of the kiss let me hold you so tight 
 For the good of getting out of control 
 For the good of the action and a race in the dark 
 For the good of those chills up your spine 
 For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart 
 For the good of what's yours and what's mine 
 For the good of believing in a life after birth 
 For the good of your body so bright 
 For the good of the search for some heaven on earth 
 For the good of one hell of a night 
 For the good of one hell of a night 
 For the good of the action and a race in the dark 
 For the good of the fire in your soul 
 For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart 
 For the good of getting out of control 
 For the good of believing in a life after birth 
 For the good of your body so bright 
 For the good of the search for some heaven on earth 
 For the good of one hell of a night, for the good of one hell of a night 
 God speed! 
 God speed! 
 God speed! speed us away! 
 God speed! 
 God speed! 
 God speed! speed us away! 
 I'll be bad for good (God speed) 
 I'll be bad for good (God speed) 
 I'll be bad for good (God speed) 
 Speed us away, speed us away, speed us away, speed us away 
 The sea is whipping the sky 
 The sky is whipping the sea 
 You can hide away forever from the storm 
 But you'll never hide away from me 
 The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark 
 And we may lose everything in the wind 
 But the Northern Lights are burning 
 And they're giving off sparks 
 I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin 
 I know that you can be bad 
 At least a little while 
 But if you give me a chance, give me one little chance 
 And give me all the love that you should 
 Then instead of being bad for just a little while 
 Then instead of being bad for just a little while 
 Then instead of being bad for just a little while 
 I'm gonna make you bad for good 
 I'm gonna make you bad for good 
 I'm gonna make you bad for good 
 I know that you'll be bad for good 
 You'll be bad for goodSomewhere a red-eyed waitress glances 
 At another movie magazine 
 Down on the corner there's a grocery boy 
 Stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams 
 Someone is cleanin' up the offices 
 One window burnin' in the dark 
 Somebody's cryin' is there any way in hell 
 To light a comet from a single spark 
 Workin' so hard I can't remember much 
 About the freedom I been workin' for 
 Felt like a prisoner 'til I looked in your eyes 
 And saw a million wide open door 
 Ya tell me put a little money away 
 Every dog'll have his day in time 
 Well I been slavin' like a dog and I got nothin' to show ya 
 But a collar and a fist fulla nickels and dimes 
 I want a piece 
 A piece a the action 
 Gimme a shot at the real thing 
 I want a piece a the action 
 A piece a the action 
 Gonna turn on the master 
 Gonna cut these strings 
 Been livin' just like my old man did 
 And neither one of us could get it right 
 Punchin' in when the day begins 
 And punchin' out the local boys at night 
 There's someone leavin' on a peelin' porch 
 And someone leavin' on a silver plane 
 I finally know the man I'd rather be 
 Girl I won't be back to getcha 'til they know my name 
 They hand you a paycheck every week 
 And steal a piece of your soul every day 
 Well I don't need no gold watch in fifty years 
 Baby let's be golden today 
 Somewhere a red-eyed waitress glances 
 At another movie magazine 
 Down on the corner there's a grocery boy 
 Stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams ...I was so hypnotized by the smile in your eyes today 
 Flying free as a bird caught in every word you say 
 I won't ever want to see you 
 This is big time 
 This is larger than life 
 See the sparks fly when your standing by my side 
 Every step, every move, everything I do 
 Life is beautiful because of you 
 Every breathe that you give 
 You are my sweet oxygen I breathe 
 You made me fall away fast 
 So my dreams could get pass the end 
 I won't ever want to feel 
 This is big time 
 This is larger than life 
 See the sparks fly when your standing by my side 
 Every step, every move, everything I do 
 Life is beautiful because of you 
 How did I survive before you came into my life 
 I'd do anything at all 
 Anything at all 
 For you 
 This is big time 
 This is larger than life 
 See the sparks fly when your standing by my side 
 Every step, every move, everything I do 
 Life is beautiful because of you 
 This is big time 
 This is larger than life 
 See the sparks fly when your standing by my side 
 Every step, every move, everything I do 
 Life is beautiful because of youBoy: 
 There's a hole in the sky tonight 
 Did the moon drift too far from sight? 
 I would search through this empty darkness 
 To see your face in the morning light 
 We've been lost in a sea of confusion 
 Got caught up in a selfish illusion 
 But make no mistake: I will bend till I break 
 Don't let fate make the choice for us 
 What about love that lasts forever? 
 What about time to see it through? 
 If you don't give you just don't get it 
 What about me? 
 What about you? 
 What about love? 
 Girl: 
 Once in a lifetime you'll find someone heaven send for you 
 For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe 
 In a love that's meant to be 
 Boy: 
 It feels like we've fallen from grace 
 Given up on the higher thing 
 'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find 
 Something to give us wings 
 What about love that lasts forever? 
 What about time to see it through? 
 If you don't give you just don't get it? 
 What about me? 
 What about you? 
 What about love? 
 Boy: 
 I can't go on another day 
 Comin' home and seeing you cryin' 
 Girl: 
 Can't stand another night 
 Of telling you I'm fine when I'm dying 
 Both: 
 Forever means nothing 
 To live without you 
 Is reaching for something that never comes through 
 Together is heaven 
 Apart we're in hell 
 The time for forgiveness is now 
 Oh, once in a lifetime you'll find 
 Someone to share your dreams 
 For a lifetime 
 Our love will always set us free 
 Forever we'll believe... 
 Boy: 
 I can't forget the feelin' of your sweat upon my skin 
 And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in 
 It happens once, only once in a lifetime 
 Girl: 
 On a summer night's surrender with nothing to lose 
 You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you 
 It happens once, only once in a lifetime 
 Both: 
 What about love that lasts forever? 
 What about time to see it through? 
 If you don't give you just don't get it 
 What about me? 
 What about you? 
 What about love that won't say never? 
 When you don't know what you can do 
 If you don't live you just regret it 
 What about me? 
 What about you? 
 What about love?I took one look and something snapped I said I love your eyes -- 
 You took my heart you took my breath away -- 
 I felt my temperature rise you said you've never loved a man this 
 Way 
 That it was heaven you were to stay 
 But now you're just another fallen angel 
 And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm 
 And now you're just another fallen angel 
 Falling into -- somebody else's arms 
 I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise-- 
 I must admit that when I first laid eyes you had me hypnotized -- 
 You said I'm sorry but I don't say much 
 But I'm in heaven when I feel your touch 
 Follow your own road baby I'll be there when you need me 
 To love and to comfort and what he got ain't 
 Enough to keep you in the air 
 Angel, I'll be thereBam bam bam my sweet 
 You can sip it through a straw;you can throw it back deep 
 Just don't be hesitatin', waitin' for it 
 Cause in an ideal world they'll be comin' for you 
 Could be tokin' on the bale, could be sniffin' out clues 
 Better stake your fakin' reputation on it 
 Do it! 
 Do it! 
 Do it! 
 Just do it! 
 Do it! 
 In a Tax-free zone, down a tin can alley 
 There's a slipper-girl and man name Sally 
 They were talk-talk-talkin' 'bout a clever little coffin nail 
 Seems, down at the docks the intended lies awaitin' 
 And the privlaged information's gonna get wet too 
 You can't be too careful when it comes to being careful 
 Do it! 
 Do it! 
 Do it! 
 Just do it! 
 Do it! 
 There's a man in my street keeps a flock of gray doves 
 And he's set in his ways, wearin Everlast gloves 
 His opinion can be beat when the push becomes a shove 
 Says he doesn't give a monkey 'bout the youth of the day 
 They should all drop dead, should be taken away 
 Put somewhere cold and all be made to stay 
 Do it! 
 Do it!

 Just do it!

 You're lookin' pretty with your jewels and bones 
 Standing 'round with the mud and the stones 
 Gotta come on down and take me home 
 You gotta give me a piece of your pie 
 'Cause I been knocking on your window 
 I been knocking on your door 
 And I been trying to get myself inside 
 Don't you know 
 That I'm riding the train now 
 Can't feel the pain now 
 Don't even know where I am 
 No turning back now 
 We're on the right track, yeah 
 I'm chugging just as fast as I can 
 Stoking the fire 
 We're getting much higher 
 Much higher than when we began 
 Riding on the train of love

 You're my savior on your Hollywood sky 
 My veins are getting horny and my soul's running dry 
 You know I've been checking out for all that I'm worth 
 But you gotta give me proof I got a life after birth 
 You gotta give me some kind of reply 
 'Cause I been knocking on your window 
 I been knocking on your door 
 And I been trying to get myself inside 
 Don't you know 
 That I'm riding the train now 
 Can't feel the pain now 
 Don't even know where I am

 Don't even know where I am.(Turn around) 
 Every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
 And you're never coming 'round 
 (Turn around) 
 Every now and then I get a little bit tired 
 Of listening to the sound of my tears 
 (Turn around) 
 Every now and then I get a little bit nervous 
 That the best of all the years have gone by 
 (Turn around) 
 Every now and then I get a little bit terrified

 Every now and then I fall apart

 And I need you now tonight 
 And I need you more than ever 
 And if you only hold me tight 
 We'll be holding on forever 
 And we'll only be making it right 
 'Cause we'll never be wrong 
 Together we can take it to the end of the line 
 Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time 
 (All of the time) 
 I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark 
 We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks 
 I really need you tonight 
 Forever's gonna start tonight 
 (Forever's gonna start tonight) 
 Once upon a time I was falling in love 
 Now I'm only falling apart 
 There's nothing I can do 
 A total eclipse of the heart 
 Once upon a time there was light in my life 
 But now there's only love in the dark 
 Nothing I can say 
 A total eclipse of the heart

 (Turn around bright eyes) 
 (Turn around bright eyes) 
 (Turn around)I dreamed there was a magic song 
 I played for the queen 'neath the golden throne 
 My heart flowed through my broken voice to her 
 The queen did smile and she did cry 
 My fingers bled a thousand lives 
 A red-teared river flowed our lives between us 
 Her majesties tears and the pauper's blood 
 An angel's breath and the devil's touch 
 The song of madness madly cryin' to her 
 You're a wolf in a lambs disguise 
 A cold lover with a warm invite 
 Mornin' gonna carry us to our grave 
 Dream a dream in agony 
 Sweetest dream you'll ever see 
 Make my dream reality 
 Oh carry me 
 Carry me to my grave 
 She placed the blade within the king's throne 
 And in mine did I place my own 
 With the lamb's blood we purchased our sins pardon 
 The sky ripped open and the shadows bled 
 The moon blew out and the stars burned red 
 The song of madness madly cryin' to her 
 On a night such as this 
 An angel's lips and the devil's kiss 
 Mornin' gonna carry us to our grave 
 Dream a dream in agony 
 The sweetest dream you'll ever see 
 Make my dream reality and carry me 
 Carry me to my grave 
 Oh carry me 
 Carry me to my grave 
 The song of madness madly cryin' to her 
 The song of madness shot like lightning through us 
 The song of madness madly cryin' to her 
 Madness 
 Madness 
 Madness 
 My God my Queen just lie to me 
 Make me believe that I am king and by morning 
 You're a wolf in a lamb's disguise 
 A cold lover with a warm invite 
 Mornin' gonna carry us to our grave 
 Dream a dream in agony 
 The sweetest dream you'll ever see 
 Make my dream reality and carry me 
 Oh carry e 
 Carry me to my grave 
 Carry me to my grave 
 Carry me 
 Carry me to my graveSome say it's wrong, some say it's right 
 Some say it's politicians playing both sides 
 Some say it's greed, some say it's change 
 Some say it's all just the price we'll have to pay 
 And I feel a storm coming in 
 And I see the earth bending in the wind 
 It's gonna rain, yeah 
 Wash it all away, yeah 
 And it ain't gonna stop 
 No, it ain't gonna stop 
 For forty days 
 Some say it's fate, some say it's chance 
 Some say it's the blood of our fathers on our hands 
 Some say it's a lie, some say it's the truth 
 Some say it's all coming down on me and you 
 And I see a fire in the sky 
 And I hear the thunder out on the edge of night 
 It's gonna rain, yeah 
 Wash it all away, yeah 
 And it ain't gonna stop 
 No, it ain't gonna stop 
 For forty days 
 Some say the stars will fall down from heaven 
 Some say the angels will cry and ask us why 
 It's gonna rain yeah 
 It's gonna rain 
 Oh, it's gonna rain

 For everything that someone said someone else had a different view 
 I watched the whole thing there unfold upon my TV screen 
 "A new world order is on its way," well, just pass the popcorn please

 Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
 Well, it's a mad, mad world 
 A little man sits up way high, way up above the crowd 
 Can you make them dance real fast, can you make them cheer out loud? 
 Money doesn't talk and yet it sounds like a big machine 
 A voice on high says you reap what you sow, just keep your own nose clean 
 (Mad, mad world)-shake your hands and say good luck

 "The Good God Is A Woman And She Don't Like Ugly": 
 Chuck D.: 
 She'll knock you right off this planet 
 To those opposed and take it for granted 
 Who knows it grows from those that planned it 
 Who ran for office and they can't stand it? 
 Who robbed and stole and took full advantage 
 And hide the shock with all them antics? 
 Whose souls exposed 'cause I dig granite 
 We rock and roll, they don't understand it 
 And damn the wack 'cause they don't want it 
 Your gold and diamonds so what you bought it 
 You don't know what I know, you just sport it 
 Bodyguards scared but you still flaunt it 
 People died in them mines and they just caught it 
 Sly slick the wicked, do you support it? 
 Kicking ask me the questions, y'all know I taught it 
 Want war? Shut up! 'Cause you ain't fought it...! 
 C'mon! 
 Terrrible 
 Power to the people 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Terrible 
 C'mon 
 C'mon!

 That it's a mad, mad world 
 Well, it's a mad, mad worl 
 Well, it's a mad, mad world 
 Mad, mad world...To say it's love would be too simple 
 Too obvious 
 It's more like a calling, a vocation 
 Something I was 
 Put on this earth to do 
 Now I'm shooting with the stars 
 And I'm flying with the angels 
 And my heartbeat is a symphony the 
 Closer I get to you 
 I never saw you comin' till you 
 Came and here you are 
 I never thought someone 
 Would ever dare 
 To come this far 
 You're up for the resistance 
 And I'm strong in my persistence 
 And I've never known 
 A remedy like ours 
 If I can't have you 
 If I can't have you 
 I would be a river dried up 
 Into dust 
 I would be imprisoned 
 For ever having loved 
 If I can't have you 
 I don't wanna be me 
 Then I would be the same man 
 You scraped off the ground 
 I'd have to go back bein' 
 That broken soul you found 
 Those days are in the darkness 
 I buried them with hardness 
 And I'd have to dig those 
 Demons out 
 Your life is like anchor that puts 
 Me in my place 
 No you won't let me sink when 
 I'm off losin' my way 
 Thank God for your virtue 
 And the wisdom in your eye 
 Cause somehow you 
 Get through on 
 All that crazy in my mind 
 If I can't have you 
 If I can't have you 
 I would be a river 
 Dried up into dust 
 I would be imprisoned for never 
 Having loved 
 If I can't have you 
 I don't wanna be me 
 I don't wanna be me 
 Why did it take you so long to 
 Finally see 
 That we had a love 
 That you don't find easily 
 You broke my heart and the price 
 To pay for that 
 Is you'll have to live the misery of 
 Losing what you had 
 If I can't have you 
 My words have come to late 
 I've already turned that page 
 Don't you look at me that way 
 'Cause you'll pull me back and 
 That's the part I hate 
 I'll stay trapped inside my hell 
 Where it's so hot 
 That my walls melt 
 And I can hear a promise 
 In every lie you said 
 You'd never tell 
 If I had only told the truth 
 Oh I could never trust you to 
 You'll survive 
 No I will die 
 If I can't have you 
 If I can't have you 
 Then I'm sorry for the things I 
 Cost you in the end 
 My punishment is more than any 
 Man can stand 
 I need you in my life 
 I can't let go 
 Why don't you stay with me 
 Tonight 
 I feel alone 
 Turn off all the lights 
 Take me home 
 If I can't have you 
 If I can't have you 
 Then I would be a river 
 Dried up into dust 
 I would be imprisoned 
 For ever having loved 
 If I can't have you 
 I don't wanna be me 
 To say it's love would be too simpleI swallowed the end of the world with my problems 
 Thought maybe a girl could solve 'em 
 Don't let anyone in 
 I'm stuck with these sins 
 I'm hoping maybe time can absolve 'em 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed to run free 
 Well that's all through 
 Thought I was runnin' from you 
 Turns out I was runnin' from me 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' away from me 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' from me 
 There's a girl who lives on my street 
 She said the flowers take care of the bees 
 She says she'll bring me a shore 
 Cause Daddy's at war 
 She's gonna take care of me 
 If history is violence and sex 
 I'd rather not pay my respects 
 If I've caused offense 
 I'm just trying to talk sense 
 Forgive me if I'm too direct 
 Or politically incorrect 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' away from me 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' away from me 
 Turns out I was runnin' from me 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed room to breathe 
 I said I needed to run free 
 All that's through 
 Thought I was runnin' from you 
 Turns out I was runnin' from me 
 Turns out I was runnin' from me 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' away from me 
 La, La, La La, La, La 
 Runnin' away from me 
 Runnin' away from me 
 Runnin' away from me 
 Runnin' away from me 
 Runnin' away from meI'm still alive 
 Must have been a miracle 
 It's been a hell of ride 
 Destination still unknown 
 It's a fact of life: 
 If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head 
 You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead 
 I'm a runaway train on a broken track 
 I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time 
 That's right 
 I got away with it all and I'm still alive 
 Let the end of the world come tumbling down 
 I'll be the last man standing on the ground 
 As long as hot blood runs trough my veins 
 I'm still alive 
 Lost in the night 
 Feeling so invisible 
 Oh, a dead man walking the wire 
 High above the devil's net 
 That's made of fire 
 And it's a long way down from the top of the world 
 You better look around or you gonna get burned 
 I'm a runaway train on a broken track 
 I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time 
 That's right 
 I got away with it all and I'm still alive 
 Let the end of the world come tumbling down 
 I'll be the last man standing on the ground 
 And as the dust clears, look in my eyes 
 I'm still alive 
 I'm still alive 
 The darkest night ain't black enough 
 To keep the morning light from shining 
 The highest wall ain't tall enough 
 To keep the smallest man from climbing 
 The more that you resist the tide 
 The more it pulls you in 
 The more you hang on for your life 
 (I'm a runaway train on a broken track) 
 (I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time) 
 (That's right) 
 That's right 
 I got away with it all and I'm still alive 
 I'm a runaway train on a broken track 
 I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time 
 That's right 
 I got away with it all and I'm still alive 
 Let the end of the world come tumbling down 
 I'll be the last man standing on the ground 
 And if my shadow's all that survives 
 I'm still alive 
 I'm still aliveThe entire city is burning 
 You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox 
 Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests 
 Barbarians prowl in shadows, their heads rocking with rodents 
 Motorcycles reproduce in noctournal alleys groaning with greasy pleasure 
 And they've blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon 
 And sent it out to sea full of screaming, lovely, lonely girlsEvery night I grab some money and I go down to the bar 
 I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car 
 You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone 
 A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone 
 Baby, baby 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 I know that you and I oh we got better things to do 
 I don't know who you are or what you do 
 Or where you go when you're not around 
 I don't know anything about you, baby 
 But you're everything I'm dreaming of 
 I don't know who you are 
 But you're a real dead ringer for love 
 A real dead ringer for love 
 Ever since I can remember you been hanging around this joint 
 You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point 
 I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do 
 But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew 
 Baby baby, baby baby 
 Rock n' roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you 
 Rock n' roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 I know that you and I oh we got better things to do 
 I don't know who you are or what you do 
 Or where you go when you're not around 
 I don't know anything about you, baby 
 But you're everything I'm dreaming of 
 I don't know who you are 
 But you're a real dead ringer for love 
 A real dead ringer for love 
 Oh! You got the kind of legs that do more than walk 
 I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk 
 Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see 
 You got a lotta nerve to come on to me 
 You got the kind of lips that do more than drink 
 You got the kind of mind that does less than think 
 But since I'm feeling kinda lonely n' my defenses are low 
 Why don't we give it a shot and get it ready to go 
 I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction 
 I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action 
 Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint 
 My daddy never noticed now he'll finally get the point 
 You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone 
 A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone 
 Baby baby, baby baby 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 I know that you and I oh we got better things to do 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 Rock 'n roll and brew 
 They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you 
 I don't know who you are or what you do 
 Or where you go when you're not around 
 I don't know anything about you baby 
 But you're everything I'm dreaming of 
 I don't know who you are 
 But you're a real dead ringer for love 
 A real dead ringer for love 
 Dead ringer for love 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love 
 (dead ringer) 
 Dead ringer for love

 (dead ringer)So this is what it feels like 
 To be the one left behind 
 To give it all you've got, then find 
 You've already changed your mind 
 And this is what it sounds like 
 Crying on the bed that we both made 
 Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me 
 Any kind of sign 
 I don't want to be here wide-awake 
 Clinging to a love that can't be saved 
 Hanging off the edge of every word 
 That you say 
 So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much 
 That I'm willing to let you go?" 
 At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes" 
 But, at the bottom of my heart I'm wondering... 
 Did I say that? 
 Did I say that? 
 Sometimes you know I over react 
 And what I say is not a matter of fact 
 I wish that I could take it all back 
 And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side 
 And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide 
 And I need some sympathy here 
 And I need someone to call my own 
 I'm standing in the light of my mistakes 
 And begging you, "come home." 
 And I know you need some time to run and hide 
 But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride 
 So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much 
 That I'm willing to let you go?" 
 At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes" 
 But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering... 
 Did I say that? 
 Did I say that? 
 Sometimes you know I over react 
 And what I say is not a matter of fact 
 I wish that I could take it all back 
 But I said that 
 And I wish I could take it all back 
 And I need some sympathy here 
 And I want a love to call my own 
 I want to take you in the back seat now 
 And slowly drive you home 
 And I know you need some time to run and hide 
 But the truth is hard to swallow when you're 
 Choking on your pride 
 I don't want to be this wide-awake 
 Fighting for a love that I can't save 
 And hanging off the edge of every word you say 
 Knowing that it might make me cry 
 I don't want to be this complicating 
 You can drag it out but I'll be waiting 
 I stumbled on "I love you" tonight 
 But it sounded like goodbye 
 Did I say that? 
 Did I say that? 
 Did I tell you that I loved you 'cause if 
 Would have been a matter of fact 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'm not letting go 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'll have and I'll hold 
 Did I tell you that I loved you cause it 
 Would have been a matter of fact 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'm walking through fire 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'll feed your desire 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'll stand by your side 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I will be your pride 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'm not letting go 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'll have and I'll hold 
 Did I say that? 
 This time I'm walking through fire 
 Did I say that? 
 And I wish that I could take it all back 
 So this is what it feels like 
 To be the one left behind 
 To give it all you've got then find 
 That you've already changed your mindI've lived my life in a cage 
 Freedom spit in my face 
 It was such a disgrace 
 And I was lonely 
 Burnt out and empty 
 Desperate 
 I had my head in a noose 
 I had nothing to lose 
 Had enough of abuse 
 So now I'm dangerous 
 Hate's so contagious 
 It owns us 
 I'm angry (I'm angry) 
 I'm raging (I'm raging) 
 I'm breaking through the pain 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you know the truth 
 Tell me can you feel it 
 As you hit the wall 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you have to choose 
 And prove that you can take it 
 To the top before you fall 
 I've walked a slippery road 
 With revenge in my soul 
 Through the wind and the cold 
 With no protection 
 Just one direction 
 Destruction 
 I've paid for all my mistakes 
 Taken all I can take 
 Till I'm ready to break 
 Life can be vicious 
 It's so outrageous 
 It breaks us 
 I'm bleeding 
 Still breathing 
 I'm tearing through these chains 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you know the truth 
 Tell me can you feel it 
 As you hit the wall 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you have to choose 
 And prove you can take it 
 To the top and never fall 
 I've lived a thousand years in darkness 
 Banished all alone 
 Inside my mind with just my madness 
 Behind these walls of stone 
 I was falling apart at the seams 
 Holding my breath just to breathe 
 Tasted the sting of my tears 
 I was waking up stuck in a dream 
 Ran out of air, couldn't scream 
 Wasted away by my fears 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you know the truth 
 Tell me can you feel it 
 As you hit the wall 
 The monster's loose 
 And now you have to choose 
 And prove that you can take it 
 To the top and never fall 
 The monster's loose 
 You've lost your last excuse 
 Now show me that you've got it 
 Even if you crawl 
 The monster's loose 
 This game is win or lose 
 The time has come to do it 
 And show the world you want it all 
 Yeahhhhhhaw 
 Yeahhhhhhaw 
 Yeahhhhhhaw 
 Yeahhhhhhaw 
 YeahhhhhhhhhhhawI want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 Can you trust me? 
 Yes, you know, you should 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 You're wastin' your time 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 I want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 Now take a chance 
 And I know, you should 
 Trust your instincts 
 And let me in 
 Just be my ride 
 And I'll be my friend 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 You're wastin' your time 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Just leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 Oh, I love it 
 I want you so hard 
 I want you so good 
 But can you trust me? 
 Yeah, you know, you should 
 Trust your instincts 
 And let me in 
 Just be my ride 
 And I'll be my friend 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Just leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Just leave him alone 
 'Cause it's just bad news 
 Oh, yeah 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 You're wastin' your time 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 You're wastin' your time 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 My friends are talkin' 
 And they're tellin' you 
 Leave him alone 
 'Cause the boy's bad news 
 Whoa, gotta tell you now 
 The boy's bad newsWell I'm looking at the man in the broken glass 
 There's a crack where his heart was beating last 
 Oh I can tell he's been through hell 
 I say never stop dreaming 
 Oh yesterday's gone 
 Tomorrow is the day 
 Oh we're not dying 
 We're just paving the way 
 For the lovers, the dreamers 
 The kids who say 
 Never stop living 
 Oh never stop living 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 We'll be in the street looking thunder in the face 
 Singing na na na na na 
 I won't change 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 Oh like water in your lungs 
 They try to shut you down 
 Take your good ideas 
 And your shout out louds 
 But they don't know 
 The movement's growing 
 We'll never stop breathing 
 Oh never before and never again 
 Will there be a moment like this my friend 
 To make a change 
 Stand up and say 
 Never stop living 
 No never stop living 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 We'll be in the street looking thunder in the face 
 Singing na na na na na 
 I won't change 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 We'll be in the street looking thunder in the face 
 Singing na na na na na 
 I won't change 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 If it rains it rains 
 We'll be in the street looking thunder in the face 
 Singing nan na na na na 
 I won't change 
 'Cause if it rains it rains 
 Oh if it rains it rains 
 Oh no now 
 Oh if it rains it rainsIf you listen to the night 
 You can hear the darkness call 
 I can barely stand to wait 
 I can barely stand at all 
 C'mon closer to me now 
 It's like we're sharing the same skin 
 We gotta get out of this jail 
 We gotta let the future in 
 So many things in your life 
 That you're bound to regret 
 "Why didn't I do that?" 
 "Why didn't I do this?" 
 So many chances you lost 
 That you'll never forget 
 "Why didn't I make it?" 
 "Why didn't I take it right there?" 
 The loneliest words you'll ever know 
 "If only-if only it was so" 
 The emptiest words that they'll ever be 
 "It could've been me!" 
 "It could've been me!" 
 The loneliest words you'll ever know 
 "If only-if only it was so" 
 The emptiest words that they'll ever be 
 "It could've been me!" 
 "It could've been me!" 
 You'll have to pay for it later 
 If you don't get it when it's going for free 
 Believe me -! 
 Believe me -! 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 It's something that's always been so 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 And one of these nights 
 You're gonna show me that you already know 
 There's a feast waiting for you 
 And you've never even gotten a taste 
 It's later than you think and 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 You shouldn't tremble when we touch 
 There's no reason for these fears 
 It's a promise that was made 
 We've been promised this for years 
 I wanna show you it all 
 What to do and where and how 
 Because we'll never be as young as we are right now 
 We'll never be as young as we are right now 
 So many cries in the night 
 That you try to ignore 
 "Why didn't I do this?" 
 "Why didn't I do that?" 
 So many unanswered prayers 
 So many unopened doors 
 "Why didn't I take it?" 
 "Why didn't I make it come true?" 
 The loneliest words you'll ever know 
 "If only-if only it was so" 
 The emptiest words that they'll ever be 
 "It could've been me!" 
 "It could've been me!" 
 The loneliest words you'll ever know 
 "If only-if only it was so" 
 The emptiest words that they'll ever be 
 "It could've been me!" 
 "It could've been me!" 
 You'll have to pay for it later 
 If you don't get it when it's going for free 
 Believe me 
 Believe me, believe me 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste

 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 It's all we're leaving behind 
 It doesn't matter what we're losing 
 It's only matters what we're going to find 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 It's all we're leaving behind 
 It doesn't matter what we're losing 
 It's only matters what we're going to find 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 It's all we're leaving behind 
 (Let's get away from the past) 
 It doesn't matter what we're losing 
 Only matters what we're going to find 
 (So many ways it could pass) 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 It's all we're leaving behind 
 It doesn't matter what we're losing 
 Only matters what we're going to find 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 It's all we're leaving behind 
 It doesn't matter what we're losing 
 Only matters what we're going to find

 It's later than you think and 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to waste 
 (A kiss is a terrible thing to waste) 
 A kiss is a terrible thing to wasteOn a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses? 
 Will he offer me his mouth? 
 Yes. 
 Will he offer me his teeth? 
 Yes. 
 Will he offer me his jaws? 
 Yes. 
 Will he offer me his hunger? 
 Yes. 
 Again, will he offer me his hunger? 
 Yes. 
 And will he starve without me? 
 Yes. 
 And does he love me? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses? 
 Yes. 
 I bet you say that to all the boys. 
 It was a hot summer night, the beach was burning 
 There was fog crawling over the sand 
 Oh, when I listen to your heart, I hear the whole world turning 
 I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands 
 Oh, you were licking your lips and your lipstick's shining 
 I was dying just to ask for a taste 
 Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining 
 By the the light of the moon, you know there's not another moment 
 Not another moment 
 Not another moment to waste 
 Oh well, you hold me so close that my knees grow weak 
 But my soul is flying high above the ground 
 I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do 
 I just can't seem to make any sound 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, and I swear it's true 
 I was just about to say I love you 
 (love you) 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, and I swear it's true 
 I was just about to say I love you 
 (love you) 
 Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water 
 And I guess that I'm beginning to grin 
 Oh, we're finally alone and we can do what we want to 
 Oh, the night is young, ain't no one gonna know where 
 No one gonna know where 
 No one's gonna know where you've been 
 Oh, you were licking your lips and your lipstick's shining 
 I was dying just to ask for a taste 
 Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining 
 By the the light of the moon, you know there's not another moment to waste 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, and I swear it's true 
 I was just about to say I love you 
 (love you) 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, and I swear it's true 
 I was just about to say I love you 
 (love you) 
 And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
 (Must have been while you were kissing me) 
 Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth 
 (Must have been while you were kissing me) 
 Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth 
 (Must have been while you were kissing me) 
 Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth 
 (Must have been while you were kissing me) 
 Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth

 Oh, oh, oh

 Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth

 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouth 
 Oh, it must have been while you were kissing me 
 You took the words right out of my mouthLong distance callin' in the middle of a rainy night 
 So much static hardly knew your voice 
 You've been cryin', want me to love you like I did before 
 Girl when it comes to you, you know I got no choice 
 You put a storm inside me 
 Oughta head for a safer harbor 
 They all tell me I should give you up 
 Well no man coulda tried any harder 
 Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end 
 Every time I hear you callin' to me 
 Just wanna feel you in my arms again 
 Like a sailor, to a siren 
 Like a moth to a flame 
 I know your love might be the death of me 
 But I run to you just the same 
 Like a sailor, to a siren 
 Nothin's gonna keep us apart 
 Crashin' over the wreckage of all the sailor's broken hearts 
 Musta met you when we were livin' in another time 
 Had nothin' but the jealous Gods to point our way 
 When we were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore 
 Wailin' like a siren leadin' him astray 
 I got another woman and I know you got another man 
 They all tell me I should give you up 
 But I don't think that any mortal can 
 Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end 
 Every time I hear you callin' to me 
 Just wanna feel you in my arms again 
 Gonna abandon ship 
 Gonna steal you from the cliff 
 Take you to a place where the Gods can't find us no more 
 Let the sailors listen to the sirens if they dare 
 Gonna be dancin' on the water 
 Drownin' in your yellow hairI've got steel on my fingers 
 Granite on my breathe 
 A bottle in one ear 
 And a spike in my chest 
 A nickel in my boot 
 And my finger in a dam 
 I hang out with a bunch 
 Of losers I call my friends 
 And we sing 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 But I'm headin' out today 
 I'm goin' down Elijah's way 
 Spinnin' wheels on fire 
 With my speed needle between my jeans 
 So darlin' show me what you're hiding 
 Behind that ring 
 Behind your pink silhouette, young lust balcony 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 We got two-thousand miles between here and home 
 They won't even know we're gone 
 I got mama's smile and my daddy's gun 
 You got your honest face and your liars tongue 
 Until Armageddon takes me 
 It's just you and me baby 
 Runnin' like the only sinners left 
 Lovin' like the only sinners left 
 Livin' like the only sinners left alive 
 Livin' on the outside 
 I've got one shot to steal this world 
 If you wanna go with me you can be my girl 
 Here's a bullet for your thoughts 
 And a penny for the train 
 Next time I'm here they'll be diggin' my grave 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 We got two-thousand miles between here and home 
 They won't even know we're gone 
 I got mama's smile and my daddy's gun 
 You got your honest face and your liars tongue 
 Until Armageddon takes me 
 It's just you and me baby 
 Runnin' like the only sinners left 
 Lovin' like the only sinners left 
 Livin' like the only sinners left alive 
 Livin' on the outside 
 Livin' on the outside 
 Livin' on the outside 
 Livin' on the outside 
 Livin' on the outside 
 If I gotta go then I'm goin' in style 
 You're gonna find me rinnin' down that calvary mile 
 A beggar's son on a potter's tree 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 Come on baby just ride with me 
 We got two-thousand miles between here and home 
 They don't even know we're gone 
 I got my mama's smile and my daddy's gun 
 Bring your honest face and your liars tongue 
 Until Armageddon takes me 
 It's just you and me baby 
 Runnin' like the only sinners left 
 Livin' like the only sinners left 
 Lovin' like the only sinners left alive 
 Livin' on the outside(And I'll go blind before I stop) 
 (And I'll go blind before I stop) 
 They're gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 (And I'll go blind before I stop) 
 'Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rock 
 There's a two ton fireball 
 Burnin' though the headphones 
 Cuttin' up my heart 
 Makin' ashes of my soul 
 A lightning bolt petition 
 Tonight I'm gonna sign 
 Trouble out my window 
 And I'm gonna find it 
 And I'm feelin' the fever 
 Takin' in the heat 
 Movin' to the boogie 
 Hittin' to the beat 
 Wrapped in rhythm 
 Dancin' till we drop 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 They're gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 'Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rock 
 Moonlite madness masquerade 
 Got my invitation baby time to play 
 Rip off the headphones 
 Shove my arm into the socket 
 Sound comes rushing through me 
 Like an intravenous rocket 
 And I'm feelin' the fever 
 Takin' in the heat 
 Movin' to the boogie 
 Hittin' to the beat 
 Wrapped in rhythm 
 Dancin' till we drop 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 They're gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 'Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rock 
 Doin' it in the market 
 Doin' it in the mall 
 Doin' it in the bushes 
 And the high school hall 
 Doin' it in the alley 
 Doin' it for free 
 Now their doin' it baby 
 On MTV 
 Doin' it in the backseat 
 Doin' it on the beack 
 Doin' it in the grandstand 
 Just dancin' on the seats 
 Doin' it in the movies 
 Doin' it on the train 
 Doin' it mile high 
 In a big jet plane 
 And I'm feelin' the fever 
 Takin' in the heat 
 Movin' to the boogie 
 Hittin' to the beat 
 Wrapped in rhythm 
 Dancin' till we drop 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 They're gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 'Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rock 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 They're gonna have to come 
 And lock me up 
 And I'll go blind before I stop 
 'Cause this boy mama 
 Just wants to rockListen 
 I was born on the other side 
 Just always looking to you 
 I made it over the great divide 
 Now I'm coming for you 
 Your forces lined up in battle 
 Your soldiers and your machines 
 The sun been blacked out by shadows 
 The darkest hour now you've ever seen 
 And I'm easy and I'm serious 
 They try and tear me down 
 You want me baby I dare you 
 Try and tear me down 
 I rose up on the doctor's slab 
 Like Lazarus from the pit 
 And everyone wants to take a stab 
 Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit 
 I've been held up on money 
 I've been beaten out of spite 
 You want a piece of me honey? 
 Lose or win 
 You know you've been in a fight 
 And I'm easy and I'm serious 
 They try and tear me down 
 You want me baby I dare you 
 Try and tear me down 
 Girl: 
 On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell to the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the war. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana, then from New York to Chicago. And when it joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state. Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings big songs and has big hits. You can try and tear him down. 
 Now there ain't much difference 
 Between a bridge and a wall 
 Without me right in the middle baby 
 You'll be nothing at all 
 And I'm easy and I'm serious 
 They try and tear me down 
 You want me baby I dare you 
 Try and tear me downShe'll be the first to say she was blind 
 To how much life can hurt sometimes 
 She learned the hard way that life ain't fair 
 It's times like these you gasp for air 
 She looks at pictures in the magazines 
 It's all smiles and lipstick, and beauty queens 
 That simple life makes her cry because 
 She remembers when hers was 
 And one more tear falls in the river 
 She watches it wash away 
 And one more prayer flies up to heaven 
 Just begging for a change 
 And one more song no one else is singing 
 She's got to sing it anyway-alone 
 Another sun becomes a moon 
 She makes it through another day 
 She makes it through another day 
 For me I think the hardest part 
 Is just watching while she falls apart 
 I try but we both know it's true 
 There ain't a damn thing I can do 
 And one more tear falls in the river 
 She watches it wash away 
 And one more prayer flies up to heaven 
 Just begging for a change 
 And one more song no one else is singing 
 She's got to sing it anyway-alone 
 Another sun becomes a moon 
 She makes it through another day 
 She makes it through another day 
 Every now and then I hear her laugh 
 It makes me think she might be coming back 
 Tell her we miss her 
 She's gone, gone 
 She's gone again 
 And one more tear falls in the river 
 She watches it wash away 
 And one more prayer flies up to heaven 
 Just begging for a change 
 And one more song no one else is singing 
 She's got to sing it anyway-alone 
 Another sun becomes a moon 
 She makes it through another day 
 She makes it through another day 
 She makes it through another day...Heaven blesses those who wait 
 Patience is a virtue son 
 Keep your toe on the line 
 Keep your foot on the brake 
 No sense jumpin' the gun 
 Girl I'm tired of waitin' you know life's too short 
 Lemme kiss ya 'til the night is done 
 Ain't no doubt about it you're my favorite sport 
 God I wanna jump the gun 
 Feel like, jumpin' the gun 
 Tonight I'm gonna jump the gun 
 No crime in havin' some fun 
 How about jumpin' the gun 
 They say it doesn't matter if ya win or lose 
 Only matters how ya play the game 
 Well let me tell ya baby if I had to choose 
 Gotta win ya know or go insane 
 Willya hold me like a trophy 
 Willya burn up the track 
 Willya love me when the title's won 
 Blow away the competition baby 
 Never look back 
 Tonight I'm gonna jump! 
 Better get ready 
 Better get set girl 
 This time we're jumpin' the gun 
 Ya think we're goin' too fast 
 Ain't sen nothin' yet girl 
 This time we're jumpin' the gun 
 Ready, take your mark 
 Oh I just can't wait 
 This time we're jumpin' the gun 
 Y'gotta break a couple rules 
 If ya wanna break the tape 
 This time we're jumpin' the gunYou say you're all alone 
 And after all the changes you've been through today 
 You can use a little tenderness right now 
 O.K. - I've been alone 
 And I can understand the way you feel tonight 
 Maybe together we can change it all right now 
 I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes 
 You need somebody you can hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 I'd love to hold you 
 If you really want to 
 Then I'd love to be the body 
 That you hold onto 
 You say, he broke your heart 
 He left you crying, but he didn't set you free 
 And now you feel like you can never love again 
 O.K. - so let me know 
 It's up to you how long you let his memory stay 
 And do you really want to carry on this way 
 I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes 
 You need somebody you can hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 I'd love to hold you 
 If you really want to 
 Then I'd love to be the body 
 That you hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 If you really want to 
 Then I really can't deny you 
 So many things you need to know 
 So many left to say 
 But, you mean more than words I know 
 I can help you chase the pain away 
 I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes 
 You need somebody you can hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 If you really want to 
 If you really want to 
 Then I'd love to be the body 
 That you hold onto 
 If you really want to 
 If you really want to 
 Then I really can't deny you 
 If you really want to 
 Oh, if you really want toIf a love as strong as ours 
 Couldn't make it all the way 
 Can anything make sense at all? 
 If a love so deep and true 
 Couldn't stand the test of time 
 Then Mount Everest could slide and Jerusalem could fall 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is forever just another word? 
 Is a promise something people used to keep 
 When love was worth fighting for? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 I can hear the final words 
 Every sentence that was said 
 Don't know what turned our lives around 
 It doesn't matter who was right 
 There's no justice in a dream 
 Never thought a heart could break without making any sound 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is forever just another word 
 Is a promise something people used to keep 
 When love was worth fighting for? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 And you thought that I'd saved you 
 Could've sworn that you saved me 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is forever just another word? 
 Is a promise something people used to keep 
 When love was worth fighting for? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is forever just another word? 
 Is a promise something people used to keep 
 When love was worth fighting for? 
 If we can say goodbye 
 If we can say goodbye 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 (If we can say goodbye) 
 (If we can say goodbye) 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is nothing sacred anymore? 
 Is nothing sacred anymore?And I never really sleep anymore, and I always get those dangerous dreams 
 And I never get a minute of peace, and I gotta wonder what it means 
 And I gotta wonder what it means 
 Maybe it's nothing and I'm under the weather 
 Maybe it's just one of those bugs going round 
 Maybe I'm under a spell and it's magic 
 Maybe there's a witch doctor with an office in town 
 Chorus: 
 Oh is this a blessing or is it a curse? 
 Does it get any better? Can it get any worse? 
 Will it go on forever or is it over tonight? 
 Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light? 
 Is it richer than diamonds or just a little cheaper than spit? 
 (I don't know what it is) 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 And there used to be such an easy way of living 
 And there used to be every hope in the world 
 And I used to get everything that I went after 
 But there never used to be this girl, but there never used to be this girl 
 Maybe I'm crazy and I'm losing my senses 
 Maybe I'm possessed by a spirit or such 
 Maybe I'm desperate and I've got no defenses 
 Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch? 
 Oh is this a blessing or is it a curse? 
 Does it get any better? Can it get any worse? 
 Will it go on forever or is it over tonight? 
 Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light? 
 It's a stairway to heaven or a subway going down to the pits 
 (Is it some kind of love?) 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 (Solo) 
 chorus 
 (I don't know what it is) I don't know what it is but it just won't quit 
 (repeats 4x) 
 There was a time when nothing ever really mattered 
 There was a time when there was nothing I didn't know 
 There was a time when I knew just what I was living for 
 There was a time and the time was so long ago 
 There was a time and the time was so long ago 
 And I never really sleep anymoreI sit in my living room thinking of you, 
 And the feelings I fear are coming true, 
 And everything about you is wrong I know it. 
 But I still taste you on my tongue, 
 And I, still breathe you in my lungs, 
 And I, wish I could stop breaking down, 
 Wish I could love you out loud. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself, 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds, 
 To be with you and no one else. 
 Don't make a sound, 
 Don't tell a soul. 
 It's 7am and I just wanna call you and tell you I'm falling in love, 
 But there's somebody else inside these four walls. 
 She smells you on my skin, 
 And I, I can't let her know where I've been, 
 And I, wish I could be with you now, 
 Wish I could love you out loud. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself, 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds, 
 To be with you and no one else. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 Because I'm under your spell, 
 Wish I could tell the whole world, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself. 
 Don't make a sound, 
 Don't tell a soul, 
 Don't tell them anything and I won't let you go. 
 Don't say a word, 
 Don't tell a soul. 
 And I shiver at the thought of you, 
 I can't believe that you love me too and we quiver when we touch, 
 I can't believe I love you so much. 
 And I hate it when you walk away, 
 I know we can't go on this way, 
 But there's magic when we touch, 
 I can't believe I love you so much. 
 (Wish I could love you out loud) 
 Which I could hear how it sounds. 
 (Wish I could love you out loud) 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself. 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds, 
 To be with you and no one else. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 Because I'm under your spell. 
 Wish I could tell the whole world, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself. 
 (Don't make a sound) 
 Don't make a sound, 
 (Don't tell a soul) 
 Don't tell a soul, 
 (Don't tell them anything and I won't let you go) 
 Don't tell them anything and I won't let you go. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 But I'll just keep it to myself. 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds, 
 To be with you and no one else. 
 (Do't say a word, 
 Don't tell a soul, 
 Don't tell them anything and I won't let you go.) 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 Because I'm under your spell, 
 Wish I could tell the whole world, 
 But ill just keep it to myself. 
 (Don't make a sound, 
 Don't tell a soul, 
 Don't tell them anything and I won't let you go.) 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds. 
 Wish I could love you out loud, 
 Wish I could hear how it sounds. 
 Wish I could love you out loud.I caught a glimpse of myself today 
 Wasn't a pretty picture, I must say 
 Well, I threw a dagger of poison words straight for my heart 
 Was it deserved? 
 Well, it's too late to make up some excuse and say it wasn't me 
 Well, what's the use? 
 Oh, you've seen too much 
 Ooh, let me introduce you to 
 This is my anger 
 This is my shame 
 These are my insecurities, that I can't explain 
 This is my fortress, crumbling 'round my feet 
 Take a good look, baby: this is all of me 
 They found that nerve deep in my soul 
 Poised and ready to explode 
 And no one else on earth but you could get close enough 
 To light that fuse 
 And you crawled up underneath my skin 
 Crept now through my veins and through my head 
 Ooh, you got so deep 
 You might as well get to know the rest of me 
 This is my anger 
 This is my shame 
 These are my insecurities, that I can't explain 
 This is my fortress, crumbling 'round my feet 
 Take a good look, baby: this is all of me 
 We all live under the same roof 
 We go by the same name 
 It saddens me to think that I cannot turn back the hands of time 
 This is my anger 
 This is my shame 
 These are my insecurities, that I can't explain 
 This is my fortress, crumbling 'round my feet 
 Take a good look, baby- 
 This is my anger 
 These are my doubts 
 These are my emotions, all strung out 
 This is my fortress, crumbling 'round my feet 
 Take a good look baby: this is all-this is all of me 
 This is all of me 
 Oh, this is all of me 
 This is all of me...Love's an hourglass 
 It goes out wide and it comes in closer 
 Time ticks away, drifts away 
 Leaving empty sanded shoulders, oh to cry on 
 Who said that love could last forever? 
 I'm growing tired of feeling like I do 
 As we drift apart 
 Little secrets come between us 
 As we sail away 
 I'm feeling comfort in the distance 
 You said that love would last forever 
 (You said that love would last forever) 
 Oh, but neither one of us will ever surrender 
 (Never surrender) 
 There's a time, there's a place 
 A change of heart, about face 
 This is about love, it's about forgiveness 
 Oh 
 Tell me now, tell me like it is 
 You don't have to give 
 Amnesty is granted 
 What's done is done for everyone 
 Come on baby, let's start again right now 
 Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty is granted 
 Amnesty is granted 
 You said that love would last forever 
 (You said that love would last forever) 
 Oh, but neither one of us will ever surrender 
 (Neither one of us will ever surrender) 
 There's a time, there's a place 
 A change of heart, about face 
 This is about love, it's about forgiveness 
 Oh 
 Tell me now, tell me like it is 
 No one has to give 
 Amnesty is granted 
 What's done is done for everyone 
 Come on baby, I wanna start again right now 
 Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty is granted 
 Oh, I been thinkin' about you 
 Lord knows I been thinkin' about you, baby 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 Tell me now, come on babe and tell me like it is 
 Lord knows there's one price to give 
 I've been thinkin' 'bout you baby 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on baby 
 Amnesty is granted 
 Amnesty, amnesty is granted 
 I've been thinkin' about you, baby 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 Hey, it's alright, it's alright 
 (Amnesty is granted) 
 It's alrightChef 
 Tonight is right for love 
 You know I wanna touch you where the lights don't go 
 Tonight is right for love with Meredith Baxter-Birney 
 Expressin' love so sweet 
 I'll keep you burnin' like a dog in heat 
 Tonight is right for love with Meredith Baxter-Birney 
 We had a love that was so magical 
 Meredith Baxter-Burnin', burnin', burnin' in my soul 
 I'm not talking about Meredith Baxter-Birney today, no 
 I'm talking about Meredith Baxter-Birney that was on "Family Ties" two years ago 
 Meat Loaf 
 After the love comes the darkness of Hell 
 A demon inside you like a bottomless well 
 Nothing is safe and everything is a lie 
 Love doesn't last, no matter how hard you try 
 Burnin', burnin' through your brain, unthinkable pain 
 Chef 
 Meat! 
 Meat Loaf 
 When you finally realize that it's all in vain 
 Chef 
 Meat Loaf! 
 Meat Loaf 
 Splinters of wood, they get forced through your eyes 
 Chef 
 Meat Loaf! 
 Meat Loaf 
 Cheese graters of steel being rubbed on your thighs 
 Chef 
 Meat Loaf! 
 Meat Loaf 
 Your skin's comin' off and you're rollin' in salt 
 Chef 
 Meat! Hey Meat! Meat Loaf! 
 Meat Loaf 
 What? 
 Chef 
 Where you goin' son? 
 Meat Loaf 
 Oh... gosh... 
 Chef 
 Come back to us, we're over here. 
 Meat Loaf 
 Yeah, OK. Oh, sorry Chef, man. Sorry. 
 Chef 
 OK, son, but this song is about Meredith Baxter-Birney, all right? But not about splinters of wood in your eye. 
 Meat Loaf 
 You're right. 
 Chef 
 Here, have a taco. 
 Meat Loaf 
 Oh, taco, great, I need a taco. 
 Chef 
 Messin' up my business with Meredith Baxter-Birney. OK? 
 Meat Loaf 
 Yeah, great. 
 Chef and Meat Loaf 
 Tonight is right for love 
 The rain is fallin' and Jay Leno is on 
 Let's turn down the lights, turn up the volume and go crazy 
 I'll touch your body and soul 
 And change the channels with remote control 
 'Cause tonight is right for love with Meredith Baxter-BirneyThere are things I have come to believe 
 Since the new resurrection of love 
 There are visions I finally see 
 There are signs everywhere, they're below and above 
 There are things that I finally know 
 There are secrets and dreams never seen in the light 
 We are suddenly plunged in the dark 
 Our soul is a beast that goes bump in the night 
 There are endless nights 
 They just go on forever 
 There are scars on scars 
 That I know will never heal 
 There's relentless pain 
 It tortures me forever 
 I've got to pretend it ain't real 
 But at least it only hurts 
 At least it only hurts ... only when I feel 
 It hurts only when I feel ...And the band began to play 
 Without a song they lose their way 
 A song of love and custom dreams 
 A song of yesterday 
 When they danced 
 When they danced 
 Her skirts were lifted high 
 She felt the music in his arms 
 The danger in his eyes 
 And a woman said, 
 No 
 And a man said, But I love you so... 
 And a woman moved closer 
 And a man said, Take my love into your heart... 
 I must have you here by my side... 
 It happened all too fast 
 They came to love and they came to last 
 No-one remembers now who lied 
 True love is made of glass 
 And a woman said, 
 Change 
 And a man said, As soon as I can... 
 And a woman said, 
 Open up 
 And a man said, Your way is right... 
 You're my love I want to be holdin' you down... 
 In the evening of their lives 
 No regrets and clear blue skies 
 They met again in old New York 
 He tells he one sweet lie 
 When they danced 
 When they danced 
 And a man said, I love you so... 
 And a woman moved closer 
 And a man said, Take my love into your heart... 
 I must have you here by my side...I was lost till you were found 
 But I never knew how far down 
 I was falling 
 Before I reached the bottom 
 I was cold and you were fire 
 And I never knew how the pyre 
 Could be burning 
 On the edge of the ice field 
 And now the chilly Californian wind 
 Is blowing down our bodies again 
 And we're sinking deeper and deeper 
 In the chilly Californian sand 
 Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart 
 And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart 
 And don't you hear me crying 
 'Oh Babe, don't go' 
 And don't you hear me screaming 
 'How was I to know' 
 I'm in the middle of nowhere 
 Near the end of the line 
 But there's a border to somewhere waiting 
 And there's a tankful of time 
 Oh give me just another moment 
 To see the light of the day 
 And take me to another land 
 Where I don't have to stay 
 And I'm gonna need somebody 
 To make me feel like you do 
 And I will receive somebody 
 With open arms, open eyes 
 Open up the sky and let the planet 
 That I love shine through 
 For crying out loud 
 You know I love you 
 I was damned and you were saved 
 And I never knew how enslaved 
 I was kneeling 
 In the chains of my master 
 I could laugh but you could cry 
 And I never knew just how high 
 I was flying 
 Ah with you right above me 
 And now the chilly Californian wind 
 Is blowing down our bodies again 
 And we're sinking deeper and deeper 
 In the chilly Californian sand 
 Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart 
 And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart 
 And don't you here me crying 
 'Oh Babe, don't go' 
 And don't you hear me screaming 
 'How was I to know' 
 I'm in the middle of nowhere 
 Near the end of the line 
 But there's a border to somewhere waiting 
 And there's a tankful of time 
 Oh give me just another moment 
 To see the light of the day 
 And take me to another land 
 Where I don't have to stay 
 And I'm gonna need somebody 
 To make me feel like you do 
 And I will receive somebody 
 With open arms, open eyes 
 Open up the sky and let the planet 
 That I love shine through 
 For crying out loud 
 You know I love you 
 For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry 
 For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why 
 My oh my, for that I thank you 
 For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold 
 For giving me a child when my body is old 
 Don't you know for that I need you 
 For coming to my room when you know I'm alone 
 For finding me a highway and for driving me home 
 For that I serve you 
 For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall 
 For revving me up when I'm starting to stall 
 And all in all for that I want you 
 For taking and for giving and for playing the game 
 For praying for my future in the days that remain 
 Oh Lord for that I hold you 
 Ah but most of all 
 For crying out loud 
 For that I love you 
 When you're crying out loud 
 You know I love youIt's only two o'clock and the temperature's beginning to soar, 
 And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead, 
 It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored, 
 And breathing is just no fun anymore, 
 And then I saw you like a summer dream, 
 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said. 
 I saw you like a summer dream and 
 You're the answer to every prayer that I ever said, 
 You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse, 
 The subways are sizzling and the skin of the street is gleaming with sweat, 
 I've seen you sitting on the steps outside, 
 And you were looking so restless and wreckless and lost, 
 I think it's time for you to come inside, 
 And I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget, 
 I think it's time for you to come inside, 
 And I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 And there'll be no turning back. 
 You were only killing time and it will kill right back, 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 It's time to burn up the fuse, 
 You've got nothing to do and even less to lose, 
 You've got nothing to do and even less to lose, 
 So wander down the ancient hallway, 
 Taking the stairs only one at a time, 
 Follow the sound of my heartbeat now, 
 I'm in the room at the top, 
 You're at the end of the line, 
 Open the door and lay down on the bed, 
 The sun is just a ball of desire. 
 And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the) 
 Out of the frying pan (and into the) 
 Out of the frying pan (and into the fire) 
 And into the fire! fire! fire! 
 And into the fire! fire! fire! 
 And into the fire! fire! fire! 
 It's only two o'clock and the temperature's beginning to soar, 
 And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead, 
 It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored, 
 And breathing is just no fun anymore, 
 And then I saw you like a summer dream, 
 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said. 
 I saw you like a summer dream and 
 You're the answer to every prayer that I ever said, 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 And there'll be no turning back. 
 You were only killing time and it will kill right back, 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 It's time to burn up the fuse, 
 You've got nothing to do and even less to lose, 
 You've got nothing to do and even less to lose, 
 So wander down the ancient hallway, 
 Taking the stairs only one at a time, 
 Follow the sound of my heartbeat now, 
 I'm in the room at the top, 
 You're at the end of the line, 
 Open the door and lay down on the bed, 
 The sun is just a ball of desire. 
 And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the) 
 Out of the frying pan (and into the) 
 Out of the frying pan (and into the fire) 
 And into the fire! fire! fire! 
 And into the fire! fire! fire! 
 And into the fire! fire! fire!I ain't livin' here no more 
 I ain't even keepin' score 
 It's too late to change, it's over 
 I'm drowned in a sea of tears 
 Nothin' I can say to you 
 Makes any difference 
 There ain't nothing I can do 
 None of it makin' sense 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Lookin' in at you 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 I'm running out of time 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Oh! 
 I'm so tired of being alone 
 In a world that feels so cold 
 There's got to be a light that I can find 
 There's got to be a soul somewhere 
 That shines for me 
 Now I don't want to live without love any more 
 I just wanna live my life 
 Love's gonna open up the door 
 Show me it's light again 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Lookin' in at you 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 I'm running out of time 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Nothin' I can say to you 
 Makes any difference 
 There ain't nothing I can do 
 None of it makin' sense 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Lookin' in at you 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Oh! 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 What can I do 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Lookin' in at you 
 (Standing on the outside) 
 Yes, I'm lookin' at youNot a dry eye in the house 
 After love's curtain comes down 
 Listen and you'll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking 
 I can still see you standin' there 
 Midnight wind blowin' through your hair 
 Remember kisses sweet in the salty air 
 When love was forever 
 Turn the page and we fade to blue 
 The scene has changed now I'm without you 
 Well, you just walked away when the act was through 
 And the dream was over 
 It was almost like a movie 
 The way you said goodbye 
 You must have spent a lot of time 
 Rehearsing each and every line 
 Now there's not a dry eye in the house 
 After love's curtain comes down 
 Listen and you'll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking 
 Not a smile left on my face 
 The ending's just too sad to take 
 And there's not a dry eye 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 The greatest story was you and me 
 We had it all we had everythinh 
 But now the story's done, it's just history 
 The last act is over 
 Your every line had the sweetest sound 
 Your every touch turned my world around 
 But then the light came up and my world crashed down 
 End of show, it's over 
 It was almost like a movie 
 Those nights we touched the stars 
 Time stood still for you and I 
 Now it's sad enough to make you cry 
 And there's not a dry eye in the house 
 After love's curtain comes down 
 Listen and you'll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking 
 Not a smile left on my face 
 The ending's just too sad to take 
 And there's not a dry eye 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 Act One: The story's just begun 
 Act Two: I fell in love with you 
 Act Three: Knew it was meant to be 
 Act Four: You don't love me no more 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 After love's curtain comes down 
 Listen and you'll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking 
 Not a smile left on my face 
 The ending's just to sad to take 
 And there's not a dry eye, not a dry eye 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 After love's curtain comes down 
 Listen and you'll hear the sound 
 Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 Not a dry eye in the house 
 Not a dry eye in the housePart One 
 At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming 
 The cars and the beast behind all start humming 
 And ooh, you've got a cool machine, so let's get it running 
 We'll break the silence of the night 
 And you know they're gonna hear us comin' 
 We always see them whisper 
 We know they're gonna talk 
 They fantasize the mysteries 
 'Bout the night and the dark 
 So baby, one more kiss, baby, one more kiss 
 We never have to say goodbye 
 Oh, one more kiss, baby, one more kiss 
 It brings a little luck to the night 
 Artists got their easels, 
 They're ready on the mark 
 Gonna try and take the pictures of 
 The dust and the gold in the sparks 
 And ooh, you got a cool machine, baby, let's get it running 
 You never looked so good before 
 And your time it's finally comin' 
 'Cause our home is the wind 
 We're the gods of the mornin' 
 Champions of the night 
 When the engine's are rumblin' 
 Oh, our home is the wind 
 We're the gods of the mornin' 
 Champions of the night 
 When the engine's are rumblin' 
 So just one more kiss, baby, one more kiss 
 We never had to say goodbye 
 One more kiss, baby, one more kiss 
 I never wanna see you cry 
 One more kiss, baby, one more kiss 
 It brings a little luck to the night 
 One more kiss, one more kiss 
 We never have to say goodbye... 
 Part Two 
 (Ready-ready to roll) 
 (Ready-ready to roll) 
 (Ready-ready to roll) 
 (Ready-ready to roll) 
 Under my foot gonna hit it down 
 Take this stance before the crowd 
 Sleepin' city, urban fall 
 Summer's sadness time to answer the call 
 (cool machine-get it runnin'-ready to roll) 
 Soft hands around my neck 
 One more kiss then time to connect 
 Leave this child, leave me all alone 
 This one's mine and I'm takin' it home 
 (ready-ready to roll) 
 This one's mine and I'm takin' it home... 
 Part Three 
 Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise 
 Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie 
 And, ooh, you got a cool machine, baby let's get it running 
 You never looked so good before 
 And you know your time it's finally comin' 
 'Cause our home is the wind 
 We're the gods of the mornin' 
 Champions of the night 
 When the engine's are rumblin' 
 Oh, our home is the wind 
 We're the gods of the mornin' 
 Champions of the night 
 When the engine's are rumblin' 
 (One more kiss, one more kiss) 
 (One more kiss, one more kiss) 
 (One more kiss, one more kiss) 
 It brings a little luck 
 Brings a little luck to the night 
 (one more kiss, one more kiss) 
 Ooh one more kiss 
 One more kiss, baby one more kiss 
 We never have to say goodbye 
 And, ooh, you got a cool machine 
 Let's get it runnin'... 
 (Fade)I've been looking for an original sin 
 One with a twist and a bit of a spin 
 And since I've done all the old ones 
 Till they've all been done in 
 Now I'm just looking - 
 Then I'm gone with the wind - 
 Endlessly searching for an original sin 
 You can dance forever, you got a fire in your feet 
 But will it ever be enough? You know that it'll never be enough 
 You can fly in never land and never need to sleep 
 But will it ever be enough? You know that it'll never be enough 
 It's not enough to make the nightmares go away 
 It's not enough to make the tears run dry 
 It's not enough to live a little better every day 
 Everything that they taught us was nothing but lies 
 Everything they they brought us was nothing but bribes 
 But it'll all be over now 
 All I wanted was a piece of the night 
 I never got an equal share 
 When the stars are out of sight 
 And the moon is down - 
 The natives are so restless tonight 
 I've been looking for an original sin 
 One with a twist and a bit of a spin 
 And since I've done all the old ones 
 Till they've all been done in 
 Now I'm just looking - 
 Then I'm gone with the wind - 
 Endlessly searching for an original sin 
 You can lose yourself in pleasure till your body's going numb 
 But will it ever be enough? You know that it'll never be enough 
 You can always take whatever you conceivably could want 
 But will it ever be enough? You know that it'll never be enough 
 It's not enough to make the nightmares go away 
 It's not enough to make the tears run dry 
 It's not enough to live a little better every day 
 Everything that they taught us was nothing but lies 
 Everything that they brought us was nothing but bribes 
 But the lies are over now 
 All I wanted was a piece of the night 
 It never had to get so dark 
 When the stars are out of sight 
 And the moon is down - 
 The natives are so restless tonight 
 I've been looking for an original sin 
 One with a twist and a bit of a spin 
 And since I've done all the old ones 
 Till they've all been done in 
 Now I'm just looking - 
 For an original sin 
 I've been looking for the ultimate crime 
 Infinite victims, infinitesimal time - 
 And I'm so very guilty for no reason or rhyme 
 So now I'm just looking 
 And I'm killing some time - 
 Endlessly searching for the ultimate crime 
 I've been looking for an original sin 
 One with a twist and a bit of a spin 
 And since I've done all the old ones 
 Till they've all been done in 
 Now I'm just looking - 
 Then I'm gone with the wind 
 Endlessly searching for an original sin 
 I'm applying for a license to thrill 
 Going out on the edge, moving in for the kill 
 They'll be hell to pay someday 
 So put it all on the bill 
 'Cause we'll always be paying, and paying until 
 We're beyond expiration, with a license to thrill

 Gimme the future, gimme the future 
 Gimme the future with a modern girl 
 Gimme the future, gimme the future

 Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new 
 There's a break in the chain, a skip in the clock 
 Girl that's where I'm gonna find you 
 Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be 
 There's a clash on the border, a flame in the sky 
 Girl that's where you gonna find me 
 Can't ya hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine 
 Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens 
 But you and I stand innocent, baby it's a brand new world

 Under the crimson cut-throat canyon sky 
 Oh, the city's on fire but the hills are alive with the sound of this night, oh yeah 
 Baby leans close and she whispers she don't care 
 She wraps her legs round my waist, runs her fingers through my hair 
 She rests her head on these soft tail lights 
 Feel the world rushing under this bike 
 Hear the cold highway explode, in rubber and fire 
 Now the only thing that matters is this never cutting through this California wind 
 She said, "take me anywhere" 
 She said, "take me everywhere" 
 Everybody's got someone they don't wanna be 
 You don't wanna be you, I don't wanna be me 
 Everybody's got a plan, everybody's got a dream 
 I ain't got nothing, I just wanna be free 
 Ain't much that's mine, but these boots and this time 
 Maybe I'll take you right out of here 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 I'm a prize fight lover, soul auctioneer 
 Now the 101 is blacker than a funeral parade 
 I grab the throttle, left a scar on the interstate 
 You see, the funny thing about leaving town 
 You leave something you think you can't live without 
 Now we're heading north, but she's looking south 
 She whispered one last request, apologize to the desert wind 
 She said, "I'll never look back again" 
 She said, "I'll never look back again" 
 Everybody's got someone they don't wanna be 
 You don't wanna be you, I don't wanna be me 
 Everybody's got a plan, everybody's got a dream 
 I got nothing, I just wanna be free 
 Ain't much that's mine, but these boots and this time 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 I'm a prize fight lover, soul auctioneer 
 I got you right here, tucked behind my ear 
 Whisper all your fears and your dreams to me 
 I can feel you here, I feel your scarred soul speak 
 With longing and nerving and its depth and its need 
 The night is alive, this voice is a knife 
 Riding shotgun tonight on your contraband soul 
 I got a key premonition, a wild proposition 
 Let the smoldering hunger in you explode 
 She ripped the knife from the scene with a fugitive scream and a gypsy prayer 
 She said, "take me anywhere" 
 She said, "take me everywhere" 
 Everybody's got someone they don't wanna be 
 You don't wanna be you, I don't wanna be me 
 Everybody's got a plan, everybody's got a dream 
 I ain't got nothing, I just wanna be free 
 Ain't much that's mine, but these boots and this time 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 Baby, I'll take you right out of here 
 I'm a prize fight lover, soul 
 I'm a prize fight lover, soul auctioneerThere were nights when the wind was so cold 
 That my body froze in bed 
 If I just listened to it right outside the window 
 There were days when the sun was so cruel 
 That all the tears turned to dust 
 And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever 
 I finished crying in the instant that you left 
 And I can't remember where or when or how 
 And I banished every memory you and I had ever made 
 But when you touch me like this (Touch me like this) 
 And you hold me like that (Hold you like that) 
 I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me 
 When I touch you like this (Touch you like this) 
 And I hold you like that (Hold you like that) 
 It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me now 
 It's all coming back 
 It's all coming back to me now 
 There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light 
 There were things I'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right 
 There were nights of endless pleasure 
 It was more than any laws allow 
 Baby, baby! 
 If I kiss you like this (Kiss you like this) 
 And if you whisper like that (Whisper like that) 
 It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me 
 If you want me like this (If you want me like this) 
 And if you need me like that (Need me like that) 
 It was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me 
 It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me 
 I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now 
 Well, come on, come on 
 But you were history with the slamming of the door 
 And I made myself so strong again somehow 
 And I never wasted any of my time on you since then 
 But if I touch you like this (Touch you like this) 
 And if you kiss me like that (Kiss me like that) 
 It was so long ago but it's all coming back to me 
 If you touch me like this (Touch me like this) 
 And if I kiss you like that (Kiss you like that) 
 It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me now 
 It's all coming back 
 It's all coming back to me now 
 There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light 
 There were things we'd never do again but they'd always seemed right 
 There were nights of endless pleasure 
 It was more than all your laws allow 
 Baby, baby, baby! 
 When you touch me like this (Touch me like this) 
 And when you hold me like that (Hold me like that) 
 It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me 
 When you see me like this (See me like this) 
 And when I see you like that (See you like that) 
 Then we see what we want to see, all coming back to me 
 The flesh and the fantasy, all coming back to me 
 I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now, come on 
 If you forgive me all this (Forgive me all this) 
 If I forgive you all that (Forgive you all that) 
 We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now 
 It's all coming back to me now 
 When I touch you like that 
 It's all coming back to me now 
 And if you do it like this 
 It's all coming back to me now 
 And if we...Madder than a mad man and bored to the core 
 Minute hand crawling can't take it anymore 
 Future's up the highway ya gotta get away 
 Gonna take a little trip and find a Tijuana stray 
 Got the time to take it 
 Got the balls to break it 
 Gotta car that'll make it 
 South of the border, don't drink the water 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light 
 Oh Senorita, have two tequila 
 Heat seeker, Lord the will is gettin' weaker 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light 
 She ain't a teacher, she ain't a preacher 
 Just so close to holy that you're runnin' just to reach her 
 Time bomb is tickin', my heads about to bust 
 Need your personal attention or I swear I'm gonna rust 
 Find a little place no one will tell you what to do 
 Tell her I'm a rebel, she says "Yea, without a clue" 
 Just need some understanding a girl who ain't demanding 
 Who ain't afraid to fake it, south of the border 
 Don't drink the water 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light 
 Oh Senorita, have three tequila 
 Love seeker, Lord the will is gettin' weaker 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light 
 She ain't a teacher, she ain't a preacher 
 Just so close to holy that you gotta run to reach her 
 Need some understanding, a girl who ain't demanding 
 A little bad behavior, she's gonna be my savior 
 My knees are shakin', my back is breakin' 
 Oh Mama Mia, a Senorita 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light 
 Oh Senorita, have two tequila 
 Heat seeker, Lord the will is gettin' weaker 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light 
 She ain't a teacher, she ain't a preacher 
 Just so close to holy that you're runnin' just to reach her 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light 
 Oh Senorita, have some tequila 
 Need sneakers, Lord the will is gettin' weaker 
 Gonna have a good time tonight 
 Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light 
 Just heard the bell, that got me outta hell 
 Got a girl, I gotta life ...Should've listened when you said I'd miss you 
 Should've listened but I could not hear 
 You said I'd want you back 
 I said not a chance 
 Now I can see I was so blind 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever leave you 
 I made a mistake 
 I'm sorry now 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever let you go 
 Now I know, now I know 
 You're right I was wrong 
 Couldn't see it when I had you with me 
 Couldn't see that I had everything 
 And now I see it clear 
 And now you are not here 
 You said someday I'd change my mind 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever leave you 
 I made a mistake 
 I'm sorry now 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever let you go 
 Now I know, now I know 
 You're right I was wrong 
 If I could have one more chance to hold you 
 I would keep you here in my arms 
 And never let you got 
 Because now I know 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever leave you 
 I made a mistake 
 I'm sorry now 
 You're right I was wrong 
 To ever let you go 
 Now I know, now I know 
 You're right I was wrongYo baby 
 I wrote you this poem 
 I'd like to dedicate it to ya 
 I'm just a white boy 
 I play the guitar 
 I put my pants on 
 I drive a shit car 
 Up into the valley 
 To see my girlfriend 
 She got a big couch 
 She got a mercedes benz 
 Sing halleluiah 
 My glass is half full 
 She pours me champagne 
 She drinks a red bull 
 Ans she says darling 
 One thing you got to understand 
 As long as I am satisfied 
 Well you will always be my man 
 You know that I 
 I'll give you all the love that I have

 Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans 
 Way back up on the woods among the evergreens 
 There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood 
 Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode 
 Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well 
 But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell 
 Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Ooh! Johnny B. Goode! 
 He used to carry his guitar in a gurny sack 
 Sit beneath the tree by the railroad track 
 Fiddlin' to the music that the drivers played 
 Sittin' there playin' all alone in the shade 
 Many people passing from miles around 
 "Boy that country boy could really fool around" 
 Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Go! Johnny! Go! Go! 
 Johnny B. Goode! 
 Jailhouse Rock 
 The warden threw a party in the county jail 
 The prison band was there and they began to wail 
 The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing 
 You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing 
 Let's rock, everybody, let's rock 
 Everybody in the whole cellblock 
 Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock 
 Slow Down

 Come on pretty baby, won't you talk with 
 Come on pretty baby, I give you one more chance 
 To try to save our romance 
 Slow down

 Baby now you're moving way too fast 
 You gotta give me a little lovin' 
 Give me a little lovin' 
 Ooh, if you want our love to last 
 Blue Suede Shoes 
 And it's one for the money 
 Two for the show 
 Three to get ready 
 Now go, cat, go 
 But don't you step on my blue suede shoes 
 You can do anything 
 But lay off of them Blue suede shoes 
 Elaine: 
 Well, you can knock me down 
 Step in my face 
 Slander my name all over the place 
 You can do anything that you want to do 
 But uh-uh - honey, lay off of my shoes 
 And don't you step on my blue suede shoes 
 You can do anything 
 But lay off of them blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 You can do anything 
 But lay off of them blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 Blue, blue, blue suede shoes 
 You can do anything 
 But lay off of them blue suede shoes... 
 Johnny B. Goode (reprise) 
 Well, his mother told him "Someday you will be a man 
 And you will be the leader of a big old band 
 Many people comin' from miles around 
 To hear you play your music when the sun goes down 
 Maybe some day your name will be in lights 
 Sayin' "Johnny B. Goode" and

 And you said nothing at all 
 Well I couldn't have said it better myself 
 Tonight the conversation takes the fall 
 Just love me like you love nobody else 
 Little lady 
 I think there's something on your mind 
 I've known you long enough to know 
 The words are not that hard to find 
 And the harder you try 
 And the longer you go 
 Well there's nothing but love 
 In those eyes anymore 
 You know what to say 
 But you never know how 
 You can keep your mouth shut 
 Because it doesn't really 
 Matter right now 
 I will guide you all the way 
 Because I know exactly 
 What you're trying to say 
 You have the right 
 To remain silent 
 I'll get the lights 
 You get that smile 
 And you say nothing at all 
 Well I couldn't have said it better myself 
 Tonight the conversation takes the fall 
 Just love me like you love nobody else 
 I see the angels 
 They're standing right outside your door 
 GIRL: 
 They're watching over me 
 They're watching over us all 
 BOY 
 You can send them home tonight 
 Because you won't need them anymore 
 GIRL: 
 In your arms 
 I think I've found 
 The safest place to fall 
 BOTH: 
 When I step in the door and I stare at your face 
 There are so many things that I wish I could say 
 Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight 
 You can keep your mouth shut 
 Because it doesn't really matter tonight 
 I will guide you 
 All the way (tonight) 
 Because I know exactly 
 What you're trying to say 
 GIRL: 
 You have the right 
 To remain silent 
 I'll get the lights 
 You get that smile 
 BOTH: 
 And you say nothing at all 
 Well I couldn't have said it better myself 
 Tonight the conversation takes the fall 
 Just love me like you love nobody else 
 BOY: 
 And I know you feel the same 
 BOTH: 
 You've been searching for the words 
 Now you know what to say 
 Oh yeah 
 BOY: 
 Just say nothing 
 Don't say a word 
 Silence is gold 
 GIRL: 
 Don't say a word 
 BOY: 
 Shhh 
 (Instrumental bridge) 
 BOTH: 
 This is the moment we've been waiting for (oh yeah!) 
 GIRL: 
 If I exercise my right 
 BOY: 
 I will take your body language 
 BOTH: 
 And hold it against you tonight 
 BOY: 
 And I know you feel the same 
 BOTH: 
 I've wondered all my life 
 If this moment comes 
 Would I know what to say 
 Boy and girl (girl in "()"): 
 Then you say nothing at all 
 (So many times I stumbled on the words that I wanted to say) 
 You said nothing at all 
 (So many thoughts that I should have just let my heart explain) 
 You said nothing at all 
 (So many ways we could turn the words around) 
 You said nothing at all 
 (So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground) 
 You said nothing at all 
 (So many dreams that are finally coming true) 
 Well I could'nt have said it better myself 
 (Now you finish me off when 
 You finish my thoughts the way you do) 
 Chorus outThe locusts are singing 
 The sun is red 
 It's gotten so late somehow 
 There's gonna be trouble 
 You know what they said 
 We should have been home by now 
 We should have been home by now 
 The thunder is rolling 
 The sky is black 
 It's gotten so dark somehow 
 There's gonna be danger 
 God, I wish we were back 
 We should have been home by now 
 We should have been home by now 
 No matter what they tell us 
 No matter what they do 
 No matter what they teach us 
 What we believe is true 
 No matter what they call us 
 However they attack 
 No matter where they take us 
 We'll find our own way back 
 I can't deny what I believe 
 I can't be what I'm not 
 I know I'll love forever 
 I know no matter what 
 If only tears were laughter 
 If only night was day 
 If only prayers were answered 
 Then we would hear God say 
 No matter what they tell you 
 No matter what they do 
 No matter what they teach you 
 What you believe is true 
 And I will keep you safe and strong 
 And sheltered from the storm 
 No matter where it's barren 
 A dream is being born 
 No matter who they follow 
 No matter where they lead 
 No matter how they judge us 
 I'll be everyone you need 
 No matter if the sun don't shine 
 Or if the skies are blue 
 No matter what the ending 
 My life began with you 
 I can't deny what I believe 
 I can't be what I'm not 
 I know this love's forever 
 I know no matter what 
 (I can't deny what I believe) 
 I can't be what Im not 
 I know this love's forever 
 That's all that matters now no matter what 
 The thunder is rolling 
 The sky is black 
 It's gotten so dark somehow 
 There's gonna be danger 
 God, I wish we were back 
 We should have been home by now 
 We should have been home by nowWe search for an answer, 
 And when it appears 
 We can challenge the world, 
 With our sweat and our tears. 
 Through winning and losing, 
 Oh, the brave never bend, 
 And the hero keeps fighting 
 Standing tall... in the end. 
 And time can do anything 
 It can mend any fall 
 It's the moment of truth that's facing us all, 
 And it's time for the hero... to stand tall. 
 It's a time for heroes, 
 Time to answer the call, 
 It's a time for heroes... oh... in us all. 
 We carry the flame, 
 For all to see 
 And the fire and the passion 
 Of what we can be. 
 And sometimes we must fight, 
 Oh, but we will never - never - bend 
 And the hero keeps fighting 
 Standing tall in the end. 
 And love can change anything 
 It's inside of us all 
 To reach out a hand 
 Oh, whenever we fall. 
 It's time for the hero to stand tall. 
 It's a time for heroes, 
 Time to answer the call, 
 It's a time for heroes to stand tall. 
 It's a time for heroes, 
 When our back's to the wall 
 It's a time for heroes, 
 In us all. 
 It's a time for heroes (it's a time for heroes) 
 Deep inside of our soul (deep inside of our soul) 
 It's a time for heroes (it's a time for heroes) 
 It's a time for heroes 
 Time to answer the call 
 It's a time for heroes to stand tall. 
 It's a time for heroes 
 And when our back's to the wall 
 It's a time for heroes 
 ( 
 Background vocals keep repeating the following line: 
 ) 
 It's a time for heroesEverytime I hear your name you know 
 I wonder why you wanted to go 
 I said no you couldn't come along for the ride 
 I said hey, I want outta here and nobody taggin behind 
 Don'tcha know I love you so I told you a lie 
 I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 A family life and a lovin' wife just ain't my kinda scene 
 Well when I'm all alone, when the nights are cold 
 I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean 
 We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try 
 Don'tcha know I love you so I told you a lie 
 I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 You know I told you a lie 
 Ah, ah ah, ah ah 
 Ut, ah ah, ah ah 
 Ah, ah ah, ah ah 
 Ut, ah ah, ah ah 
 A family life and a lovin' wife just ain't my kinda scene 
 Well when I'm all alone, when the nights are cold 
 I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean 
 We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try 
 Don'tcha know I love you so I told you a lie 
 I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 You know I told you a lie when I told you goodbye 
 Don'tcha know, I love you so I 
 Don'tcha know, I love you so I told you 
 Don'tcha know, I love you so I told you a lie 
 Love you so I told you a lie 
 I loved you so I told you a lie 
 Loved you so, loved you so 
 Ah 
 Loved you so I told you a lie 
 Ah 
 Loved you so I told you a lieAnd I would do anything for love 
 I'd run right into hell and back 
 I would do anything for love 
 I'll never lie to you and that's a fact 
 But I'll never forget the way 
 You feel right now, oh no, no way 
 And I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that 
 No, I won't do that 
 Anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that, ah 
 No, I won't do that 
 And some days it don't come easy 
 And some days it don't come hard 
 Some days it don't come at all 
 And these are the days that never end 
 And some nights you're breathing fire 
 And some nights you're carved in ice 
 Some nights you're like nothing 
 I've ever seen before or will again 
 And maybe I'm crazy 
 Oh, it's crazy and it's true 
 I know you can save me 
 No one else can save me now but you 
 As long as the planets are turning 
 As long as the stars are burning 
 As long as your dreams are coming true 
 You better believe it 
 That I would do anything for love 
 And I'll be there till the final act 
 And I would do anything for love 
 And I'll take the vow and seal a pact 
 But I'll never forgive myself 
 If we don't go all the way tonight 
 And I would do anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that 
 No, I won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 And some days I pray for silence 
 And some days I pray for soul 
 Some days I just pray to the God of 
 Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll 
 And some nights I lose the feeling 
 And some nights I lose control 
 Some nights I just lose it all 
 When I'm watching you dance and the thunder rolls 
 And maybe I'm lonely 
 That's all I'm qualified to be 
 There's just one and only 
 One and only promise I can keep 
 As long as the wheels are turning 
 As long as the fires are burning 
 As long as your prayers are coming true 
 You better believe it 
 That I would do anything for love 
 And you know it's true and that's a fact 
 And I would do anything for love 
 And there'll never be no turning back 
 But I'll never do it better than I do it with you 
 So long, so long 
 And I would do anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that 
 No, no, no, I won't do 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 I would do anything for love 
 Anything you've been dreaming of 
 But I just won't do that 
 But I'll never stop dreaming of you 
 Every night of my life, no way 
 And I would do anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that 
 No, I won't do that 
 Will you raise me up? Will you help me down? 
 Will you get me right out of this god forsaken town? 
 Will you make it all a little less cold? 
 I can do that 
 Oh, I can do that 
 Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight? 
 Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white 
 Can you make it all a little less old? 
 I can do that 
 Oh woah now, I can do that 
 Will you make me some magic with your own two hands? 
 Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand? 
 Can you give me something I can take home? 
 Now, I can do that 
 Oh woah now, I can do that 
 Will you cater to every fantasy I've got? 
 Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha? 
 Will you take me places I've never known? 
 Now, I can do that 
 Oh woah now, I can do that 
 After awhile you'll forget everything 
 It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling 
 And you'll see that it's time to move on 
 I won't do that 
 I won't do that 
 I know the territory, I've been around 
 It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down 
 Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around 
 I won't do that 
 No, I won't do that 
 Anything for love 
 Oh, I would do anything for love 
 I would do anything for love 
 But I won't do that 
 No, I won't do that(Boy:) 
 I never knew so many bad times 
 Could follow me so mercilessly 
 It's so surreal all the pain that I feel 
 The future ain't what it used to be 
 It doesn't matter what they're thinking 
 It doesn't matter what they're thinking of me 
 It's always so cold and I'm too young to be old 
 The future ain't what it used to be 
 Were there ever any stars in the sky? 
 And did the sun ever shine so bright? 
 Do you have any dreams I can borrow 
 Just to get me through the lonely nights? 
 Is there anything left to hold on to 
 When the rivers wash it all away? 
 Is there anyone left to hold on to? 
 Is there anything left I can say? 
 Say a prayer for the fallen angels 
 Stem the tide of the rising waters 
 Toll a bell for the broken hearted 
 Burn a torch for your sons and daughters 
 The endless night has got a hold of me 
 Dark days are pulling me forward 
 And all these years are washing over me 
 And I'm crying - I'm lost forever 
 In a future that ain't what it used to be 
 A future that ain't what it used to be 
 A future that ain't what it used to be no more... 
 (No more, no more, no more) 
 (Girl:) 
 It's like a storm that's never ending 
 It's like a shadow on the land and the sea 
 There's nothing as sad as a tomorrow gone bad 
 The future ain't what it used to be, come on 
 (Boy:) 
 Some days I feel so numb and empty 
 And those would be the good days for me 
 (Both:) 
 Nothing gets to me now unless I'm thinking of how 
 The future ain't what it used to be 
 (Boy:) 
 Were there ever any stars in the sky? 
 And did the sun ever shine so bright? 
 Do you have any dreams I can borrow 
 Just to get me through the lonely nights? 
 (Both:) 
 Is there anything left to hold on to 
 When the rivers wash it all away? 
 Is there anyone left to hold on to? 
 Is there anything left I can say? 
 Say a prayer for the fallen angels 
 Stem the tide of the rising waters 
 Toll a bell for the broken hearted 
 Burn a torch for your sons and daughters 
 The endless night has got a hold of me 
 Dark days are pulling me forward 
 And all these years are washing over me 
 And I'm crying - I'm lost forever 
 In a future that ain't what it used to be 
 A future that ain't what it used to be 
 A future that ain't what it used to be no more 
 (Girl:) No more, no more, no more, no more 
 (Boy:) No more 
 (Girl:) No more, no more, no more, come on 
 (Boy:) No more, no more, no more, come on 
 The future just ain't what it used to be 
 The future just ain't what it used to be 
 The future just ain't what it used to be 
 Oh, the future just ain't what it used to be 
 (Girl:) The future that ain't what it used to be no more... 
 Oh, the future just ain't what it used to be 
 (Girl:) The future that ain't what it used to be no more... 
 Hmmm, the future just ain't what it used to be 
 (Girl:) Ah, the future, the future, the future, the future... 
 Oh, the future, the future, the future just ain't what it used to be 
 (The future just ain't what it used to be) 
 Oh, future just ain't what it used to be 
 Ah, the future just ain't what it used to be 
 (Girl:) The future... 
 (Both:) 
 I wish it wouldn't come 
 I wish it wouldn't come 
 I wish it wouldn't come but it always does...If God could talk 
 Would He tell you to come back to me? 
 If God could talk 
 Would He tell you it's all right, just leave 
 And don't look back at all the memories 
 The best of times, the mess you made of me 
 Walk on, if you think it's gonna make you strong 
 Why don't you run away 
 And find yourself alive 
 Go on and turn the page 
 Before your lonely world collides 
 What's it gonna take to break the silence 
 That's been tearin' you apart? 
 If God could talk 
 Would He part the oceans straight to you 
 Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through 
 Another day, another night alone 
 Stepping out into the great unknown tonight 
 Even God knows, baby, that ain't right 
 Why don't you run away 
 And find yourself alive 
 Go on and turn the page 
 Before your lonely world collides 
 What's it gonna take to break the silence 
 That's been tearin' you apart? 
 If only God could talk 
 Did you swear to yourself 
 On the day it was over 
 That you'd never turn around 
 And get locked up in another cage? 
 Did you tear all the pictures 
 Of us living life together 
 Did you burn all the mem'ries 
 That have been made in a fit of rage? 
 Why don't you run away 
 And find yourself alive 
 Go on and turn the page 
 Before your lonely world collides 
 What's it gonna take to break the silence 
 That's been tearin you apart? 
 If only God could talk 
 If only God could talk 
 If only God could talk 
 If only God could talk 
 Ooh, would you listen now if God could talk?Touch me 
 I'm so afraid to draw you close 
 Hold me 
 Before my hands fall away 
 I'll suffocate 
 If I can't breathe you in 
 And hold you there 
 Forever 
 I left a message at the hotel 
 They said you checked out 
 They said you ain't coming back 
 I tried to call you 
 But you turned off your cell 
 And it said at the tone 
 Just leave me alone 
 And I fall apart at the seams 
 It seems that I always, always fall apart 
 But as strong as I am 
 Why can't I break your heart? 
 I remember how it used to be 
 Making love to you all night long 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 And hold you there until all my strength was gone 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I built this prison that I thought was a home 
 And we both lived here 
 Guess you were living alone 
 I'd tear it down if you would only have asked 
 And I would build you a bridge 
 So you could come back 
 And I fall apart at the seams 
 It seems that I always, always fall apart 
 But as strong as I am 
 Why can't I break your heart? 
 I remember how it used to be 
 Making love to you all night long 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 And hold you there until all your fears were gone 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 Girl: Hey, now tell me why can't you just break my heart? 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 And I used to take you in my arms 
 Girl: I loved you from the start 
 Now you can't tear my world apart 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 Now every bit of faith is gone 
 Girl: You used to be so strong 
 Now you can't even break my heart 
 I used to be a man of steel 
 I used to take you in my arms 
 What's it going to take for us to break down? 
 And finally fall 
 Apart at the seams 
 It seems that I always will fall apart 
 Girl: As strong as you are ... 
 As strong as I am ... 
 Girl: Why can't you break my heart?Talkin' about rock 'n' roll mercenaries 
 Soilders of fortune by some other name 
 I'm talking about rock 'n' roll mercenaries 
 Money is power, and power is fame

 Just listen 
 Everything to catch your ear

 Anything and everything they do it themselves

 Rock 'n' roll mercenaries 
 Ooh, talkin' aboutI've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say 
 I thought I'd leave you with a letter of firey speech 
 Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play 
 And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense 
 I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away 
 I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant 
 Well I could tell you "good-bye" or maybe "see you around" 
 With just a touch of a sarcastic "thanks" 
 We started out with a bang and at the top of the world 
 Now all the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks 
 And everything's blank 
 If I could only find the words then I would write it all down 
 If I could only find a voice I would speak 
 Oh, it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight 
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep 
 If I could only find the words then I would write it all down 
 If I could only find a voice I would speak 
 Oh, it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight 
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep 
 I've been whispering softly 
 Trying to build a cry up into a scream 
 We let the past slip away 
 And put the future on hold 
 Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream 
 And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense 
 I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away 
 I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant 
 Well I could tell you "good-bye" or maybe "see you around" 
 With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks 
 But now the rooms are all empty and the candles are dark 
 The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks 
 And everything's blank 
 If I could find the words then I would write it all down 
 If I could only find a voice I would speak 
 Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight 
 C'mon, will you look at me 
 And read 'em and weep 
 It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart 
 It's running silent and angry and deep 
 It's here in my eyes and it's all I can say 
 C'mon, will you look at me 
 And read 'em and weep 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For all the hours we'll be spending alone 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For the dreams we'll ignore 
 (Running silent and deep) 
 And all those promises we promised to keep, 
 They won't be kept anymore. 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For the magic that our bodies had made 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For the blood that we've lost 
 (Running silent and deep) 
 And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed 
 For whatever the cost 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For the memories still alive in the bed 
 (Read 'em and weep) 
 For the lies we believed 
 (Running silent and deep) 
 And all the things that can never be said 
 Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep. 
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep 
 (It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart 
 It's running silent and angry and deep) 
 It's there in my eyes, it's all I can say 
 C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weepI didn't take a suitcase 
 I had to travel light 
 I climbed out my bedroom window 
 It was just about quarter past midnight 
 Out on the highway 
 I hitched a ride 
 I was heading west 
 I had to listen to some trucker 
 Tell me all about the meaning of life 
 Got a ride just outside of Memphis 
 I was wild out on the road 
 I saw shanties and shacks 
 And burned out Cadillac's 
 And faces that glittered like gold 
 Shoulda seen it coming 
 Shoulda seen the signs 
 I saw seven horses running 
 I had a front row seat at the end of time 
 I was just fifteen 
 And the world was mine 
 And I watched my dreams 
 Come to life on that night 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 Now since that long lost summer 
 I ain't ever looked back 
 Now the lines on my face 
 Are looking more like cracks 
 When the dreams all crumble 
 It's time to face the facts 
 I don't care about tomorrow 
 Oh there's no looking back 
 I shoulda seen it coming 
 Oh I shoulda seen the signs 
 I saw seven horses running 
 I had a front row seat at the end of time 
 I was just fifteen 
 And the world was mine 
 And I watched my dreams 
 Come to life on that night 
 I was standing tall 
 Thought I would never die 
 And I watched it all 
 In the white spot light 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I shoulda seen it coming 
 Oh I shoulda seen the signs 
 I saw seven horses running 
 I had a front row seat at the end of time 
 When the lights went out 
 I heard the young girls scream 
 The sound of my heart beat 
 My heart beat 
 Would make the thunder proud 
 Well I was just fifteen 
 And the world was mine 
 The wolrd was mine 
 And I watched my dreams 
 Come to life on that night 
 Well I was standing tall 
 I was standing tall 
 Thought I would never die 
 I would never die 
 And I watched it all 
 In the white spot light 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 I saw Elvis in Vegas 
 Oh I saw Elvis in VegasWhere have all good men gone and where are all the gods? 
 Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds? 
 Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? 
 Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
 He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast 
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light 
 He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon 
 And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life 
 Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy 
 Somewhere just beyond my reach there's someone reaching back for me 
 Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat 
 It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
 He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast 
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light 
 He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon 
 And he's gotta be larger than life 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
 Up where the mountains meet the heavens above 
 Out where the lightning splits the sea 
 I could swear there is someone, somewhere, watching me 
 Through the wind and the chill and the rain 
 And the storm and the flood 
 I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
 He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast 
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light 
 He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon 
 And he's gotta be larger than life 
 I need a hero 
 I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the nightHit it! 
 Everything I've ever dreamed of 
 Has begun to fade to black 
 Oh, I don't know where I ever lost love 
 Or where to go now to get it back 
 I'm a desperate, lonely child and I don't have enough 
 I've come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love 
 If it ain't real - fake it! 
 If it ain't yours - take it! 
 If it don't exist - you make it! 
 If it ain't broke - break it! 
 If it ain't real - fake it! 
 If it ain't yours - take it! 
 If it's gone to sleep - you wake it! 
 If it ain't broke - break it! 
 Gimme some words I can live by 
 Gimme commandments to know 
 Gimme some fables and proverbs 
 You gotta gimme some signs where to go 
 There are designated angels who just might save your soul, no! 
 They give me words to live by - and that's all that I know 
 If it ain't real - fake it! 
 If it ain't yours - take it! 
 If it don't exist - you make it! 
 If it ain't broke - break it! 
 If it ain't real - fake it! 
 If it ain't yours - take it! 
 If it's all gone bad - forsake it! 
 If it ain't broke - break it...

 And if it ain't broke - break it...I don't know I can do this 
 What am I supposed to say? 
 You have been my dream for so long 
 Now that dream is slipping away 
 I don't want to let you go 
 It's only that I know I must 
 I can't hardly get the words out 
 Baby is this the end of us? 
 You know that I want You 
 You know that I need you baby 
 You know that I love you 
 So why isn't that enough? 
 I'v been sleeping in the daytime 
 I've been weeping at the scene 
 Wishing you would haunt me 
 And you would tell me this was all a dream 
 Wishing you were here beside me 
 What I would give to hold you tight 
 But nothing I can do or say 
 Will change the truth tonight 
 You know that I want You 
 You know that I need you baby 
 You know that I love you 
 So why isn't that enough? 
 If I want you 
 And I need you 
 And I love you 
 And I want that to be enough 
 Because I want you 
 And I need you 
 And I love you 
 And I want that to be enough 
 Yes I want you 
 And I need you 
 And I love you 
 And I want that to be enough 
 Yes I want you 
 And I need you 
 And I love you 
 And I want that to be enough 
 I don't want to let you go 
 It's only that I know I must 
 I can hardly get the words out 
 Baby is this the end of us 
 You know that I want You 
 You know that I need you baby 
 You know that I love you 
 So why isn't that enough? 
 Why isn't that enough? 
 I wish it was enoughThe sirens are screaming and the fires were howling 
 Way down in the valley tonight 
 There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
 And a blade shining oh so bright 
 There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky 
 And a killer's on the bloodshot streets 
 Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising 
 Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter 
 He was starting to foam in the heat 
 Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world 
 That's pure and good and right 
 And wherever you are and wherever you go 
 There's always gonna be some light 
 But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now 
 Before the final crack of dawn 
 So we gotta make the most of our one night together 
 When it's over you know, we'll both be so alone 
 Well like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 When the night is over 
 Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone, gone, gone 
 Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 When the day is done and the sun goes down 
 And the moonlight's shining through 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram 
 I'm on a silver black phantom bike 
 When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry 
 And we're all about to see the light 
 Nothing ever grows in this rotten old hole 
 And everything is stunted and lost 
 And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls 
 And nothing's ever worth the cost 
 And I know that I'm damned if I never get out 
 And maybe I'm damned if I do 
 But with any other beat I got left in my heart 
 You know I'd rather be damned with you 
 If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night with you 
 If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night, dancing through the night 
 Dancing through the night with you 
 Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world 
 That's pure and good and right 
 And wherever you are and wherever you go 
 There's always gonna be some light 
 But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now 
 Before the final crack of dawn 
 So we gotta make the most of our one night together 
 When it's over you know, we'll both be so alone 
 Well like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 When the night is over 
 Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone, gone, gone 
 Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 But when the day is done and the sun goes down 
 And the moonlight's shining through 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 See myself tearing up the road 
 Faster than any other boy has ever gone 
 Well and my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 
 And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape 
 But I can't stop thinking of you 
 And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late, no 
 And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late 
 Then I'm dying on the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
 And the last thing I see is my heart still beating 
 Breaking out of my body, flying away like a bat out of hell 
 Dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 I'm torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
 And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating, still beating 
 Breaking out of my body, flying away like a bat out of hell 
 Well like a bat out of hell, like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 Like a bat out of hellYou see me now as large as life 
 But underneath you knew all too well 
 The hollow shell no spark of life 
 Where once upon a time there beat a heart for you 
 And you knew it from the start 
 But you went and blew it all away 
 And you knew how, yeah you knew best 
 The strings to pull and the buttons to press 
 To wind me up and make me shake 
 You controlling every move I make 
 I couldn't see through it 
 All the pain 
 And you put me through it 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over ... 
 How could you say there was no other 
 Why is it nothing's what it seems 
 You told me I'm your greatest lover 
 Do you even know what that word means 
 You lovin' is coolin' 
 Baby who d'ya think you're foolin' 
 'Cause when I woke up 
 I caught you cheatin' in your dreams 
 Stop it, stop it 
 Don't you say a word 
 I felt my hands around her neck 
 And everything went blurred 
 Broken, broken 
 She slipped from out my hands 
 She lay so still and lifeless 
 I cried baby, baby, baby ... 
 How could you say there was no other 
 Why is it nothing's what it seems 
 You told me I'm your greatest lover 
 Do you even know what that word means 
 Your lovin' is coolin' 
 Baby who d'ya hink you're foolin' 
 'Cause when I woke up 
 I caught you cheatin' in your dreams 
 Cheatin', cheatin' 
 Cheatin' in your dreams 
 It was my dumb luck 
 I just came unstuck 
 When my whole world shook 
 I'd had about enough 
 'Cause when I woke up 
 I caught you cheatin' in your dreamsDid you ever love somebody 
 So much that the earth moved 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Even though it hurt to 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Nothin' else your heart could do 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Who never knew 
 Did you ever lay your head down 
 On the shoulder of a good friend 
 And then had to look away somehow 
 Had to hide the way you felt for them 
 Have you ever prayed the day would come 
 You'd hear them say they'd feel it too 
 Have you ever loved somebody 
 Who never knew 
 And if 
 And if 
 You did 
 You did 
 Well you know I'd understand 
 I could 
 I could 
 I would 
 More than anybody can 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 So much that the earth moved 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Even though it hurt to 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Nothin' else your heart could do 
 Did you ever love somebody 
 Like I love you 
 Like I love youMeat Loaf: 
 Sometimes it's the night 
 And the way it seems to cry 
 And whisper terrifying secrets in your ear 
 Sometimes it's the day 
 And the sun has got no mercy 
 Lighting up and burning everything that's in its way 
 There are times I've gotta run 
 Times I've gotta hide 
 Things I've left undone 
 Things I've cast aside 
 So many things to try 
 So many things denied 
 If I ever tell you the truth 
 I'd swear you would leave me 
 I need the proof 
 That you would believe me 
 Karla DeVito: 
 You think I fly like an angel without any tears 
 Higher and higher, above the world and all its fears 
 Ellen Foley: 
 Everybody's ready to fly 
 But the storms are never so very far 
 Karla and Ellen: 
 And you think my life is shining like a star 
 But the fears are never very far 
 And ... 
 All: 
 We always seem so much braver than we ever are 
 We always dream we seem braver but we never are 
 Karla and Ellen: 
 Let's run away 
 Let's go so far ... 
 II. 
 Meat Loaf: 
 There are secrets I never can tell 
 There are shadows of darkness and heaven 
 There are so many suburbs of hell 
 And their hours are 24/7 
 There are so many wounds you can't heal 
 So many nightmares are turning too real 
 So much of paradise lost and you added the cost 
 But there's nothing to be sorry for 
 Now we can feel so much more 
 Now we can be loving you 
 Nothing that we're scared to do 
 Ellen: 
 You see me smile and you swear that I could walk on air 
 You see me dancing, the moonlight glancing at my hair 
 You see me as powerfully strong 
 But the nightmare's never so very far 
 Karla: 
 And you think my life is shining like a star 
 But the tears are never very far! 
 The fears are never very far! 
 And ... 
 All: 
 We always seem so much braver than we ever are 
 We always seem to be braver but we never are 
 Karla and Ellen: Let's fly away 
 Let's go too far ... 
 III. 
 Karla: 
 Sometimes it's the flesh 
 And the way it seems to yearn 
 For all the magic of the single perfect touch 
 Ellen: 
 Sometimes it's the soul 
 And it's waiting for salvation 
 You'll know when you get it 
 There can never be too much 
 Karla and Ellen: 
 There are times I've gotta run 
 Times I've gotta hide 
 Things I've left undone 
 Things I've cast aside 
 So many things to try 
 So many things denied 
 If I ever tell you the truth 
 Would you ever believe me? 
 Show me the proof 
 I'm so scared you would leave me 
 Meat Loaf: 
 You think I fly like an angel without any care 
 Higher and higher, as if I'm breathing sacred air 
 Meat Loaf and Karla: 
 Everybody's ready to fly 
 But the storms are never so very far 
 And you think my life is shining like a star 
 But the fears are never very far 
 Or the nightmare's never very far 
 And ... 
 All: 
 We always seem so much braver than we ever are 
 We always dream we seem braver but we never are 
 Let's run away 
 Let's go too far ...

 Ellen: 
 Say a prayer for those who crawl 
 Say a prayer for those who run 
 Say a prayer so all and all 
 There's a better life to come 
 (We always seem so much braver than we ever are ...) 
 Meat Loaf: 
 Say a prayer for those alone 
 Say a prayer for those apart 
 All the golden boys and girls 
 The crusaders of the heart 
 (We always dream we'd be braver but we never are ...) 
 Karla: 
 Say a prayer for all the lost 
 Say a prayer for the unborn 
 Say a prayer for all the young 
 It takes a fire to keep them warm 
 Meat Loaf: 
 Say a prayer for those obsessed 
 Say a prayer for those enslaved 
 Say a prayer to beat the drums 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 Say a prayer for all the saints 
 Say a prayer for all the sins 
 Let the dancing never end 
 Let the future now begin 
 Meat Loaf and Karla: 
 Say a prayer to all the gods 
 Some are near and some are far 
 Say a prayer to all the gods 
 To make us braver than we are 
 V. 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 How far is too far baby? 
 Come on and take me, take me! 
 We're crusaders of the heart 
 And going all the way is just the start 
 Karla: 
 The crusaders of the heart 
 Ellen: 
 How far is too far? 
 How far is too far, baby? 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 Take me deep inside the heart 
 And going all the way is just the start 
 Ellen: 
 How far is too far baby?

 Come on and take me, take me!

 (Say a prayer) 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 Going all the way is just the start 
 Karla: 
 Make us braver than we are 
 Meat Loaf: 
 There's no such thing as too far 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 I've got to be where you are 
 Going all the way is just the start 
 Karla: 
 The crusaders of the heart 
 Ellen: 
 How far is too far? 
 Meat Loaf: 
 I've got to be where you are 
 Meat Loaf and Ellen: 
 Going all the way is just the start

 This is one of the neighbors from down the street. 
 This racket of this music has been goin' on all afternoon 
 And I'm sick and tired of it. If it doesn't stop I'm calling the police! 
 You got me on the run, you got it your way 
 Now I'm feeling pretty good and I'm beginning to sweat 
 Your love is so fine, it's got me feelin' all right 
 Going out of my mind, I got to have you tonight 
 The girl's so deep inside, like blood in my veins 
 Never lets me hide, now I'm going insane 
 It makes me climb the walls, bite my nails to the bone 
 It's always by my side, it never leaves me alone 
 When it's time to get tough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine) 
 When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine) 
 Masculine 
 I know that I'm a man from the spark in my soul 
 It can make me so hot, you got out of control 
 Grab her by the hair, drag her back to your cave 
 It's what makes a man a man, people always stay the same 
 I'm masculine 
 Masculine, masculine (repeats) 
 In the heat of the night 
 Masculine 
 And in the dark of the day 
 Masculine 
 Anytime, anyplace, anyway 
 Masculine 
 When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine) 
 When she wants to make love, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine) 
 If you push me I'll shove, I'm masculine 
 When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine 
 When she wants to make love, I'm masculine... (to fade)You can't run away forever 
 But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start 
 You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun 
 You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart 
 Think of how we'd lay down together 
 We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong 
 Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods 
 Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs 
 I treasure your love 
 I never want to lose it 
 You've been through the fires of hell 
 And I know you've got the ashes to prove it 
 I treasure your love 
 I want to show you how to use it 
 You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
 And I know you've got the scars to prove it 
 Remember everything that I told you 
 And I'm telling you again that it's true 
 When you're alone and afraid and you're completly amazed 
 To find there's nothing anybody can do 
 (Keep on believing and you'll discover, baby) 
 There's always something magic 
 There's always something new 
 And when you really, really need it the most 
 That's when rock and roll dreams come through 
 The beat is yours forever 
 (the beat is yours forever) 
 The beat is always true 
 (true) 
 And when you really really need it the most 
 That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you 
 Once upon a time was a backbeat 
 Once upon a time all the chords came to life 
 And the angels had guitars even before thay had wings 
 If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night 
 Get you through the night)

 You've been through the fires of hell 
 And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

 You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
 And I know you've got the scars to prove it 
 Remember everything that I told you 
 And I'm telling you again that it's true 
 You're never alone 'cause you can put on the phones 
 And let the drummer tell your heart what to do 
 (Keep on believing and you'll discover, baby) 
 There's always something magic 
 (there's always something magic) 
 There's always something new

 (That's when rock and roll dreams come through)Waiter said this table's set for three 
 Well, that's too bad 'cause no one's joining me 
 Maybe I prefer to dine alone 
 What you don't understand about a party of one? 
 I used to keep a lot of people around 
 Who had their hands over my eyes, ears and mouth 
 Just like the money and the buzz they were gone in the morning 
 Now I'm a party of one 
 Want to get away on a holiday 
 So I packed my bags and I flew away 
 I'm in the air and I'm so turned on 
 Honey, can't you see I'm a party of one? 
 I used to keep a lot of people around 
 Who had their hands over my eyes, ears and mouth 
 Just like the money and the buzz they were gone in the morning 
 These days I wake up and there's no one in sight 
 Sometimes it gets so lonely I don't mind 
 I live alone but at least my roommate knows me 
 I'm a party of one 
 Don't get to comfortable 'cause you gotta go 
 You have some nerve showing up here, oh! 
 Oh, talk to the hand 
 Talk to me on my level 
 I used to keep a lot of people around 
 Who had their hands over my eyes, ears and mouth 
 Just like the money and the buzz they were gone in the morning 
 These days I wake up and there's no one in sight 
 Sometimes it gets so lonely I don't mind 
 I live alone but at least my roommate knows me 
 Now I'm a party of one 
 I'm a party... 
 Help me, no! 
 I'm a party of one 
 Help me out of this box 
 Get me out of here 
 I'm a party of one...All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray 
 I went for a walk on a winter's day 
 I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A. 
 California dreamin' on such a winter's day 
 Stopped in to a church I passed along the way 
 Well, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees) 
 And I began to pray (I began to pray) 
 You know the preacher likes the cold (preacher likes the cold) 
 He knows that I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay) 
 Oh now, California dreamin' 
 (California dreamin') On such a winter's day, oh yeah... 
 All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown) 
 And the sky is gray (and the sky is gray) 
 I went for a walk (I went for a walk) 
 On a winter's day (on a winter's day) 
 If I didn't tell her, I could leave today 
 Oh now, California dreamin' (I thought you went away) 
 Oh now, California dreamin' (on such a winter's) 
 Oh now, California dreamin' 
 (California dreamin') on such a winter's day... 
 (Dreamin') 
 Oh now, California dreamin' 
 (Such a winter's day) 
 Oh now, California dreamin' 
 (Cali-for-ni-a, thought the sky was grey) 
 California dreamin' 
 (Such a winter's day) 
 Oh, California dreamin' 
 (California dreamin') 
 (Dreamin') 
 And the sky is gray 
 And the skies are gray...Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine 
 Let me tell your fortune life that once was mine 
 She was a special girl and she meant the world to me 
 And I gave her everything 
 When I found her, I'd been looking everywhere 
 And when I lost her, I was lost beyond despair 
 Dreams are hard to touch, could it be I love her too much 
 Bottom line is she was fine in every way 
 And it's not with hesitation that I say 
 Dreams they come and go, but thoughts, 
 Like love, will always growTu eres cruel (monstro) 
 No eres fiel (monstro) 
 Hijo del mal (monstro) 
 Un ser fatal (monstro) 
 Tu corazon (monstro) 
 Es un ladron (monstro)Some people get by 
 With a little understanding 
 Some people get by 
 With a whole lot more 
 I don't know 
 Why you gotta be so undemanding 
 One thing I know 
 Is I want more! 
 (More, more, more ...) 
 I want more! 
 (More, more, more ...) 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 Why'd you get sad? 
 To feel so much? 
 To let somebody touch you? 
 So hot, so cold 
 So far, so out of control 
 Hard to come by 
 But not all 
 Some people get by 
 With a little understanding 
 And some people get by 
 With a whole lot more 
 I don't know 
 Why you gotta be so undemanding 
 I want more! 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 There are parts of me that don't get nervous 
 Not the parts that shake 
 You won't get what you deserve 
 You are what you take 
 Broken hearts are the Devil's playground 
 I'm not done yet 
 Counterfeit lovers 
 Or a virtual orgy 
 Anything I can get! 
 Some people get by 
 With a little understanding 
 And some people get by 
 With a whole lot more 
 I don't know 
 Why you gotta be so undemanding 
 One thing I know 
 I want more! ... 
 (More, more, more ...) 
 I want more! 
 (More, more, more ...) 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 I want more! 
 (And I need all the love I can get) 
 (And I need all the love that I can't get too) 
 I want more! ... 
 I want more! ... 
 I want more! ...Some say it's wrong, some say it's right 
 Some say it's politicians playing both sides 
 Some say it's greed, some say it's change 
 Some say it's all just the price we'll have to pay 
 And I feel a storm coming in 
 And I see the earth bending in the wind 
 It's gonna rain, yeah 
 Wash it all away, yeah 
 And it ain't gonna stop 
 No, it ain't gonna stop 
 For forty days 
 Some say it's fate, some say it's chance 
 Some say it's the blood of our fathers on our hands 
 Some say it's a lie, some say it's the truth 
 Some say it's all coming down on me and you 
 And I see a fire in the sky 
 And I hear the thunder out on the edge of night 
 It's gonna rain, yeah 
 Wash it all away, yeah 
 And it ain't gonna stop 
 No, it ain't gonna stop 
 For forty days 
 Some say the stars will fall down from heaven 
 Some say the angels will cry and ask us why 
 It's gonna rain- 
 Yeah 
 It's gonna rain 
 Oh, it's gonna rain 
 It's gonna rain, rain, rain, rain, yeah 
 Wash it all away 
 (It's gonna rain) for forty days 
 (It's gonna rain) for forty days 
 (It's gonna rain) for forty days 
 (It's gonna rain) for forty days 
 (It's gonna rain) 
 (It's gonna rain) 
 (It's gonna rain) 
 (It's gonna rain)Hey Ricky, now mine is empty 
 How about one for you 
 We could set it out together 
 Seems tomorrow's overdue 
 Captain Video, done went home 
 One pilot laid to rest 
 And dragon ladies talk that talk 
 About who loves who, who loves best 
 Silver bullets in the jukebox 
 Spin another round 
 Everybody at the back of the line 
 It's midnight at the lost and found 
 Midnight at the lost and found 
 Lost souls in the hunting ground 
 A remedy for all your ills 
 At the lost and found 
 Midnight at the lost and found 
 Midnight 
 Have a double it's gettin' late 
 You'll get home home, just rely on fate 
 Place just finally came alive 
 Good old boys just arrived 
 Stools keep changin' faces 
 And the night just slips away 
 And like a long distance love affair 
 Soon you've got to pay 
 Silver bullets in the jukebox 
 Spin another round 
 Everybody at the back of the line 
 It's midnight at the lost and found

 Belly up and bury, boy, all the hurt you feel today

 (at the lost and found)Meat Loaf with Mark McGrath: 
 This town splits right down the middle 
 There's rich and poor, black and white 
 Right down through the saints and the sinners 
 And the ones who might 
 This world is tough as a splinter 
 There's ones that flinch and ones that fight 
 Round here you can sure tell the difference 
 'Tween the rocks and the rolling types 
 I know I'm gonna stick with ya 
 When the hard times hit 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 In the lightning, when it pours 
 Be strong enough to lean on 
 Show you what a backbone's for 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Somebody's gotta stand... 
 John Rich with Mark McGrath: 
 Well, nobody likes a white flag quitter 
 Leaves you there, tucks and runs 
 Life's comin' and it hits like a hammer 
 Kicks like a shotgun 
 I ain't out here looking for trouble 
 I'm no stranger to an uphill fight 
 You need a hand when it all starts slipping? 
 You can bet I'm-a hold on tight 
 Well, you know I'm gonna stick with ya 
 When the hard times hit 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 In the lightning, when it pours 
 Be strong enough to lean on 
 Show you what a backbone's for 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Lil Jon: 
 What? 
 What? 
 Okay 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 So tough, I keep it rough 
 Won't back down, I laugh at these clowns 
 Me and my crew, we keep it Trump-tight 
 Live yours boy-this is my life 
 I stick my chest out so there's no doubt 
 I had enough, no trust, win I must 
 As I stomp through the rain 
 The pain rushes through my vein 
 But I still maintain 
 Nah! 
 Checked out, I'm off duty 
 Insane like Busey 
 Now who wants test weee...? 
 Now see I'm the best at it 
 You just like the rest at it 
 I'm sick like a meth addict 
 But ain't no intervention 
 Just your apprehension 
 And then your dissension 
 Shots to your dome 
 Send you home 
 Screaming no backbone 
 'Cause I will show you what a backbone's for, baby 
 Let's go! 
 Chorus (Lil Jon ad-libs): 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 In the lightning, when it pours 
 Be strong enough to lean on 
 Show you what a backbone's for 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 In the lightning, when it pours 
 Be strong enough to lean on 
 Show you what a backbone's for 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 [Lil Jon:] Somebody 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Lil Jon: 
 Show you what a backbone- 
 Show you what a backbone- 
 Show you what a backbone's for... 
 Meat Loaf (Lil Jon ad-libs): 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm 
 Somebody gotta 
 Somebody gotta, yeah 
 Somebody's gotta stand in the storm...Who needs the young? 
 The revelation of their faces and their hair 
 When all we have are withered traces of the faces we once were 
 And suffocation in the dirty, fatal air 
 Who needs the young bodies floating in the sun? 
 Who needs the young? 
 The celebration of the races that they've have won 
 The sado masochistic things they've never done - disgusting 
 And all the places that we never will have gone 
 Who needs the young bodies floating in the sun? 
 Who needs the young? 
 My eyes just aren't what they were 
 My eyes just aren't what they were 
 My eyes just aren't what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can see? Blind him! 
 My lips just aren't what they were 
 My lips just aren't what they were 
 My lips just aren't what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can kiss? Spit on him! 
 My mind just isn't what it was 
 My mind just isn't what it was 
 My mind just isn't what it was 
 Is there anyone left who can dream? Wake him! 
 My legs just aren't what they were 
 My legs just aren't what they were 
 My legs just aren't what they were 
 Is there anyone left who can dance? Cripple him! 
 My voice just isn't what it was 
 My voice just isn't what it was 
 My voice just isn't what it was 
 Is there anyone left who can sing? Silence him! 
 My sex just isn't what is was 
 My sex just isn't what is was 
 My sex just isn't what is was 
 Is there anyone left who can fuck? Screw them! ... 
 Who needs the young? 
 The perfect star of flesh that never has to cry 
 Who needs the filthy moaning passed from thigh to thigh? 
 Who needs the self-appointed prophets waving banners in the bloodshot sky 
 Who needs the young when we're spending all the rest of our wonderful lives learning to die! ...Everyday of my life they say the same old thing 
 Hey boy! - (oh boy) - you better wait your turn 
 And everyday of my life I get the same old line 
 Hey boy! - (oh boy) - when are you going to learn 
 I wanna go on the red, (I wanna) I wanna go on the green 
 I wanna go on all colors that I see in between 
 I wanna run all the tolls, (I wanna) I wanna run all the signs 
 I wanna run all the way across a double white line 
 But everyday of my life I see the same old road 
 Hey girl! - (oh girl) - we gotta pull up our routes 
 And everyday of my life I see the same old dream 
 Hey girl! - (oh girl) - I need a dream I can use 
 I wanna go on the red - I wanna go on the green 
 (I wanna go, I wanna) 
 I wanna go on all colors that I see in between 
 I wanna run all the tolls - I wanna run all the signs 
 (I wanna run, I wanna run all the signs) 
 My body is the car and my soul is the ignition 
 Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we... 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 We're sick and tired of waiting in line 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 Nobody's taking our time 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 That's all we're leaving behind 
 There oughta be a law and there better be a crime 
 There oughta be a law and there better be a crime 
 And every night of my life there's something holding me back 
 Hey girl! - (What is it boy) -Oh, girl, I know it's time to cut loose 
 And every night of my life I dream of someone like you 
 Hey girl! - (What is it boy) - Oh, girl, you got a dream I can use 
 Tire tracks and broken hearts 
 That's all we're leaving behind 
 My body is the car and my soul is the ignition 
 Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we... 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 We're sick and tired of waiting in line 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 Nobody's taking our time 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 We're sick and tired of waiting in line 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 Nobody's taking our time 
 Peel out! (Peel out!) Peel out! (Peel out!) Peel out! 
 We're sick and tired of waiting in line 
 Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! 
 Peel out!Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 No one will be watching us 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road?

 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it, do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 No one will be watching us 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Why don't we do it in the road?

 Well, now no one will be watching us 
 Why don't we do it in the road? 
 Oh, yeahI don't want to let another minute get by 
 They're slipping through our fingers, but we're ready to fly 
 The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below 
 We got the music in our bodies and the radio 
 And when the morning arrives it'll all be gone 
 Disappearing in (to) the crack of dawn 
 We better make our move now before the sun is awake 
 It's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace 
 And I don't want to let another minute get by 
 Love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky 
 We may be running out of night, but never running out of steam 
 We're acting on a hunch, and we'll be acting out a dream 
 There really isn't any time to lose 
 They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light 
 You're such a pretty boy 
 Let me show you what to do, and you'll do it 
 But you gotta move faster 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 It's all we ever wanted 
 And all we'll ever need 
 And it's slipping through our fingers 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 It's all we ever wanted 
 And all we'll ever need 
 And it's slipping through our fingers 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Let me show you how to drive me crazy 
 Let me show you how to make me feel so good 
 Let me show you how to take me to the edge of the stars and then back again 
 You've gotta show me how to drive you crazy 
 You've gotta show me all the things you want to happen to you 
 We've gotta tell each other everything we always wanted someone to do 
 I don't want to push you now and I don't want to rush 
 We're getting closer every second now, but close is not enough 
 The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below 
 We got the music in our fingers and the radio 
 There really isn't any time to lose 
 We're going to lose it if we wait until it gets too light 
 You're such a pretty boy 
 Let me show you what to do, and you'll do it 
 But you gotta move faster 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 It's all we ever wanted 
 And all we'll ever need 
 And it's slipping through our fingers 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 It's all we ever wanted 
 And all we'll ever need 
 And it's slipping through our fingers 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of night 
 Faster than the speed of nightOperator, number, please 
 It's been so many years 
 And she'll remember my old voice 
 While I fight the tears 
 Hello, hello there is this Martha 
 This is old Tom Frost 
 And I am calling long distance 
 Don't worry about the cost 
 It's been 40 years or more 
 Now, Martha, please recall 
 And meet me out for coffee 
 Where we'll talk about it all 
 And those were days of roses 
 Poetry and prose and Martha 
 All I had was you and all you had was me 
 And there was no tomorrows 
 As we packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved it for a rainy day 
 And I feel so much older now 
 And you're much older, too 
 Oh, how's the husband and how's the kids 
 You know that I got married, too 
 Oh lucky that you found someone 
 To make you feel secure 
 Oh, 'cause we were all so young and foolish 
 Now we are mature 
 And those were days of roses 
 Poetry and prose and Martha 
 All I had was you and all you had was me 
 And there was no tomorrows 
 As we packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved it for a rainy day 
 And I was always so impulsive 
 I guess that I still am 
 But all that really mattered then 
 Was that I was a man 
 I guess that our being together 
 Was never meant to be 
 Oh but Martha, oh Martha, I love you 
 Can't you see 
 And those were days of roses 
 Poetry and prose and Martha 
 All I had was you and all you had was me 
 And there was no tomorrows 
 As we packed away our sorrows 
 And we saved it for a rainy day 
 And I remember quiet evenings, trembling close to youEverything is permitted 
 Everything is allowed 
 And all our gods we have outwitted 
 We are running with the crowd 
 And all the clocks are showing zero 
 And all our parents must have fled 
 And we just never had no heroes 
 And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead 
 Everything is permitted 
 There is nothing out of bounds 
 There are no limits or no fences 
 There is always some way round 
 And all the compass points are zero 
 And all the navigators fled 
 And we just never had no heroes 
 And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead 
 So if everything is permitted 
 If nothing ever is taboo 
 There there is always something shattered 
 When there is something breaking through 
 And all the clocks are showing zero 
 And all our parents must have fled 
 And we just never had no heroes 
 And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead 
 If everything is permitted 
 If nothing ever is taboo 
 There there is always something shattered 
 When there is something breaking through 
 There there is always something shattered 
 When there is something breaking through 
 Everything is permittedI was standing with my paper there, minding my own news 
 For everything that someone said someone else had a different view 
 I watched the whole thing there unfold upon my TV screen 
 "A new world order is on it's way," well, just pass the popcorn please 
 You don't mean to tell me no one else is gonna get hurt 
 When there's folks at home who eat dog food and they can't afford a shirt 
 Sure find out real fast just who's a sitting duck 
 When it's a 
 (Mad, mad world) Shake your hands and say good luck 
 (Mad, mad world) I cannot believe this stuff 
 (Mad, mad world) Getting madder every day 
 (Mad, mad world) Get involved and they'll blow you away 
 Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
 Well, it's a mad, mad world 
 A little man sits up way high, way up above the crowd 
 Can you make them dance real fast, can you make them cheer out loud? 
 Money doesn't talk and yet it sounds like a big machine 
 A voice on high says you reap what you sow, just keep your own nose clean 
 (Mad, mad world) Shake your hands and say good luck 
 (Mad, mad world) I cannot believe this stuff 
 (Mad, mad world) Getting madder every day 
 (Mad, mad world) Get involved and they'll blow you away 
 Sure find out real fast just when you've had enough 
 Well, it's a mad, mad world 
 (Mad mad world) 
 She'll knock you right off this planet 
 To those opposed and take it for granted 
 Who knows it grows from those that planned it 
 Who ran for office and they can't stand it? 
 Who robbed and stole and took full advantage 
 And hide the shock with all them antics? 
 Whose souls exposed 'cause I dig granite 
 We rock and roll, they don't understand it 
 And damn the wack 'cause they don't want it 
 Your gold and diamonds so what you bought it 
 You don't know what I know, you just sport it 
 Bodyguards scared but you still flaunt it 
 People died in them mines and they just caught it 
 Sly slick the wicked, do you support it? 
 Kicking ask me the questions, y'all know I taught it 
 Want war? Shut up! 'cause you ain't fought it...! 
 C'mon! 
 Terrrible 
 Power to the people 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Terrible 
 C'mon 
 C'mon! 
 (Mad, mad world) Shake your hands and say good luck 
 (Mad, mad world) I cannot believe this stuff 
 (Mad, mad world) Getting madder every day 
 (Mad, mad world) Get involved and they'll blow you away 
 Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
 That it's a mad, mad world 
 Well, it's a mad, mad worl 
 Well, it's a mad, mad world 
 Mad, mad worldYou're sure of what your name is, you're sure of where you live 
 You know how much you make, ah, you know how much you give 
 You know where your house is, you know which road to take 
 Ah, but you're sure 'bout lots of things, look out, there's one mistake 
 There just ain't no doubt: 
 There's just one thing you're never too sure about 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 Oh, you can never be too sure about the girl 
 You leave her there, when you get back 
 She calls you Bill... when your name is Jack 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 You know about the truth, you can see it in her eyes 
 One thing you know about love--it'll cut you down to size 
 You hear what they tell you, do you do what you're told? 
 And if they say yes, does it mean it's really so? 
 There just ain't no doubt: 
 There's just one thing you're never too sure about 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 Oh, you can never be too sure about the girl 
 You leave her there, when you get back 
 She calls you Bill... when your name is Jack 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 You're ready for the thrill tonight 
 You think you'll take it slow 
 But she's forgotten more, boy, than you will ever know... 
 She calls you up in the middle of the night 
 She says she's lonesome, and alone 
 You're all revved up, finally some place to go 
 You knock on that door--nobody's home 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 Oh, you can never be too sure about the girl 
 You leave her there, when you get back 
 She calls you Bill... when your name is Jack 
 Never can be too sure about that girl 
 Oh, you can never be too sure about the girl 
 She'll drive you crazy boy, oh, no no 
 Never can be too sure about the girl 
 Never too sure 
 Never too sure 
 Never too sure 
 Never too sure 
 Never too sure about that girl 
 Ah, you can never be too sure about the girl 
 Ah, you can never be too sure about the girl...Baby, we can talk all night 
 But that ain't getting us nowhere 
 I told you everything I possibly can 
 There's nothing left inside of here 
 And maybe you can cry all night 
 But that'll never change the way that I feel 
 The snow is really piling up outside 
 I wish you wouldn't make me leave here 
 I poured it on and I poured it out 
 I tried to show you just how much I care 
 I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout 
 But you've been cold to me so long 
 I'm crying icicles instead of tears 
 And all I can do is keep on telling you 
 I want you 
 I need you 
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you 
 Now don't be sad 
 'Cause two out of three ain't bad 
 Now don't be sad 
 'Cause two out of three ain't bad 
 You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach 
 You'll never drill for oil on a city street 
 I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks 
 But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box 
 I can't lie 
 I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not 
 No matter how I try 
 I'll never be able to give you something 
 Something that I just haven't got 
 Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love 
 And that was so many years ago 
 And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart 
 She never loved me back, ooo I know 
 Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night 
 Ah she kissed me and got out of our bed 
 And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door 
 She packed her bags and turned right away 
 And she kept on telling me 
 She kept on telling me 
 She kept on telling me 
 I want you 
 I need you 
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you 
 Now don't be sad 
 'Cause two out of three ain't bad 
 I want you 
 Oh I need you 
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you 
 Now don't be sad 
 'Cause two out of three ain't bad 
 Now don't be sad 
 'Cause two out of three ain't bad 
 Baby, we can talk all night 
 But that ain't getting us nowhereI left my home in Norfolk Virginia 
 California on my mind 
 I straddled that Greyhound 
 And rode into Raleigh 
 And on across Caroline 
 I had motor trouble that turn into a struggle 
 Halfway across Alabam' 
 And that hound broke down and left me all stranded 
 In downtown Birmingham 
 Right away I brought me a through train ticket 
 Ridin' across Mississippi clean 
 And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham 
 Smoking into New Orleans 
 Somebody help me get out of Louisiana 
 Just to help me get to Houston Town 
 There are people there who care a little about me 
 And they won't let a poor boy down 
 Sure as you're born brought me a silk suit 
 And put luggage in my hand 
 And I woke up high over Albuquerque 
 On a jet to the Promised Land 
 Working on a T-bone steak a la carte 
 Flying over to the golden state 
 When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes 
 He would set us at the terminal gate 
 Ooh, Swing low chariot come down easy 
 Taxi to the terminal zone 
 Cut your engines and cool your wings 
 And let me make it to the telephone 
 Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia 
 Tidewater four ten o nine 
 Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling 
 And the poor boy is on the line 
 Swing low chariot come down easy 
 Taxi to the terminal zone 
 Cut your engines and cool your wings 
 And let me make it to the telephone 
 Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia 
 Tidewater four ten o nine 
 Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling 
 And the poor boy is on the line 
 Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling 
 And the big boy is on the lineYou better pray she took her morning medication 
 Or you might have to pick her up at the police station 
 'Cause if there's trouble in this town, you know she's gonna find it 
 She's like the devil in a short skirt but I don't mind it 
 Everybody thinks I'm crazy, but they don't even know 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She'll cut you on the your thumb 
 She'll kick you when you're low 
 And fuck you when she's done 
 The bitch is like a rose 
 And let me tell you son 
 That every time you think you've got control 
 Sh-sh-she got it 
 Maybe I'm a victim of infatuation 
 You know that hot-blooded girl's got my inspiration 
 Yeah it doesn't really matter that she isn't 21 
 'Cause she's always backstage when the band gets done 
 Everybody thinks I'm crazy, but they don't even know 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She'll cut you on the your thumb 
 She'll kick you when you're low 
 And fuck you when she's done 
 The bitch is like a rose 
 And let me tell you son 
 That every time you think you've got control 
 Sh-sh-she got it 
 She got jagged edges and a dirty mouth 
 (What a lady) 
 She got everything that I don't wanna live without 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 And you might wanna run 
 'Cause even when she's cold 
 She's burnin like the sun 
 The bitch is like a rose 
 And smokin' like a gun 
 Don't care if you don't like her 
 I love her 
 I love her 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She's kinda like a rose 
 She'll cut you on the your thumb 
 She'll kick you when you're low 
 And fuck you when she's done 
 The bitch is like a rose 
 And let me tell you son 
 That every time you think you've got control 
 Every time you think you've got control 
 Sh-sh-she got itHeaven can wait 
 And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart 
 Will take me through the lonely night 
 Through the cold of the day 
 And I know, I know 
 Heaven can wait 
 And all the gods come down here just to sing for me 
 And the melody's gonna make me fly 
 Without pain, without fear 
 Give me all of your dreams 
 And let me go alone on your way 
 Give me all of your prayers to sing 
 And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day 
 I got a taste of paradise 
 I'm never gonna let it slip away 
 I got a taste of paradise 
 It's all I really need to make me stay 
 Just like a child again 
 Heaven can wait 
 And all I've got is time until the end of time 
 Well, I won't look back, I won't look back 
 Let the altars shine 
 And I know that I've been released 
 But I don't know to where 
 And nobody's gonna tell me now 
 And I don't really care, no, no, no 
 I got a taste of paradise 
 It's all I really need to make me stay 
 I got a taste of paradise 
 If I had it any sooner you know 
 You know I never would have run away from my home 
 Heaven can wait 
 And all I've got is time until the end of time 
 Well, I won't look back, I won't look back 
 Let the altars shine 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Well, I won't look back, I won't look back 
 Let the altars shine 
 Let the altars shineWell now 
 Goodbye my friend, it was good to know you 
 I hope you understand 
 Twenty-one years and I ain't got nothin' 
 But I'm sittin' here wonderin' if I can 
 Wishin' and dreamin', hopin' and reachin' 
 For things I was never meant to have 
 If my foolish life's a product of my gross misconceptions 
 Who's gonna give a damn? 
 I don't want 
 Peace on earth 
 I just wanna to go, 
 I just wanna to go home 
 Well I know I never was much more than you expected 
 So I expect I won't disappoint 
 But my dreams are not as hollow as the empty world I saw 
 Though I guess I never did get the point 
 Life can not just be the only option left 
 The only thing you can count on in this world is regret 
 I don't want 
 Peace on earth 
 I just wanna go 
 I just wanna go home 
 Right world wrong time 
 And they say to me, 
 "Hang cool teddy bear" 
 Best thing to do is just feed 'em fear 
 Get 'em thinking about there and forgetin' about here 
 Don't try to fight, don't try to win 
 When they knock you down 
 You gotta get back up again 
 I don't wanna be an end 
 To break this back and bleed these hands 
 To take my strength and all I am 
 To steal my soul for all your plans 
 I, I don't wanna be 
 But I'm not so self righteous to think that I 
 Would not take one hundred thousand lives 
 To see, oh, my mothers eyes 
 And trace that southern smile 
 I don't wanna die 
 I don't wanna die 
 I don't want too much more than 
 A working man deserves 
 Just a life worth living 
 And a death worth dying for 
 Oh 
 I don't want 
 Peace on earth 
 I so want 
 Peace on earth 
 I don't want 
 Peace on earth 
 Oh I so want 
 Peace on earth 
 And I just wanna go home 
 I just want to go home 
 I just want to go home 
 I just want to go home 
 I just want to go home 
 I don't want 
 Peace on earthWhy can't the Godz up in heaven assemble 
 An army of battleships, bombers, and minds 
 To lift up the good and make bad people tremble? 
 Things would then be better for the Godz 
 Godz and mankind!

 In this country ... 
 In this country ... 
 A man with a dream needs luck ... 
 A man with a dream needs luck ... 
 Only if someone with power will help him ... 
 Only if someone with power will help him ... 
 Only if someone with power will help him ... 
 Can he make all his dreams come true ... 
 Why don't the Godz take a look at the earth again 
 And give all the children a world they desire? 
 Send soldiers and tanks to lift up all the holy ones 
 And attack all the others with cannons? 
 Cannons and fire?

 Cannons and fire? Fire! Fire! ...Damn you crazy man! 
 Hit it! 
 Everything I've ever dreamed of 
 Has begun to fade to black 
 Oh, I don't know where I ever lost love 
 Or where to go now to get it back 
 I'm a desperate, lonely child and I don't have enough 
 I've come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love

 Gimme some words I can live by 
 Gimme commandments to know 
 Gimme some fables and proverbs 
 You gotta gimme some signs where to go 
 There are designated angels who just might save your soul, no! 
 They give me words to live by, and that's all that I know

 (Come on) 
 (Come on) 
 Break it!Meet me downtown on the corner 
 I'll be waiting in a big yellow cab 
 Don't bring a suitcase 
 You won't need a thing 
 There'll be no worries 
 Where angels sing 
 I got my ticket in my hand 
 Oh, the price is paid in full 
 No man can stop me 
 Their words won't sting you 
 No dreams will haunt me 
 Where Angels sing 
 I get so weary 
 On this troubled road 
 Unlock these chains 
 And gently rock me home 
 Beyond the clouds and the rain 
 Where Angels sing 
 Where Angels sing 
 Where lies can't hurt 
 The flesh desert me 
 No in or out 
 No loss or doubt 
 No living with or doing without 
 Where money ain't the power king 
 And kindness is the most precious thing 
 Where angels sing 
 Oh, where angels sing 
 Where time means nothing 
 No hustle 
 No one rushing 
 Np dark of night 
 No hate or spite 
 No wrong or right 
 No day or night 
 No towns or no cities 
 There's no pain, no pity 
 Where hunger is no longer 
 And a good man just gets stronger 
 Where angels sing 
 Where angels sing 
 Where angels sing 
 Where angels sing 
 Where angels sing 
 Where angels singThe waves are poundin' on the sand tonight

 Goddess 
 But you treat her like a slave and you can't hold her back anymore 
 She's like a dreamer in a dungeon or an Angel in a cave 
 And I'll be closer to you now than any other boy 
 And you know what I'm saying is true you're gonna break her up 
 And tear her down and fade her away 
 And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do 
 I'll make you pay for everything that you do

 When the screws are tightnin' and the tears are falling 
 I can hear her crying out to be saved and like a bolt of lightning 
 I go answer the call but then 
 She's singing like a siren to me over the waves 
 I never wanted to take away your lover 
 Until I heard her cry out to be saved 
 I always thought of you as one of my brothers 
 But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves

 When the sky is falling and you're looking 'round for somewhere to hide 
 Did you ever call out to someone? 
 Did you ever call out to me? 
 I've never been gone 
 I've been right here by your side 
 There ain't nothin' but clouds 
 There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes 
 Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth? 
 You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth 
 Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most? 
 You're so busy trying to get even 
 You never even try to get close 
 I can't explain it away 
 Doesn't make any sense 
 To know what it's like 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 Guess you gotta go through it 
 Guess you gotta go through it 
 It doesn't matter baby 
 Loving you's a dirty job 
 (Loving you, loving you's a dirty job) 
 But somebody's gotta do it 
 Girl: 
 There were times when we'd never fake it 
 There were times we would always make it 
 There were times we would take it to the limit 
 And we'd never, ever, ever leave each other alone 
 We were flesh and blood and bone 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 Boy: 
 There were times when we took our chances 
 There were times we were damn good dancers 
 Girl: 
 There were times when we heard all the answers 
 Both: 
 In the bleeding of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll 
 Boy: 
 I can see right through your soul 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 Girl: 
 If your fears could only be forgotten 
 We could pull all the barriers down 
 Would you follow your dreams' desire? 
 Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire? 
 Let's peel out of this town 
 Both: 
 It's been nothing but dreams 
 It's been nothing but dreams until now 
 Girl: 
 You're never gonna see it 
 Both: 
 You got your head stuck in the sand 
 Girl: 
 It's the land of the free and easy street 
 Both: 
 It's the home of the damned 
 Girl: 
 Oh, you're never gonna see it 
 Both: 
 You better open up your eyes 
 You're the only one who's left 
 Who's gonna believe all your lies? 
 Girl: 
 I can't explain it away 
 It doesn't make any sense 
 Both: 
 To know what it's like 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 You gotta go through it 
 You gotta go 
 It doesn't matter baby 
 Both: 
 Loving you's a dirty job 
 (Loving you, loving you's a dirty job) 
 But somebody's gotta do it 
 Boy: 
 There were times when our bodies glistened 
 There were times that we can't stop missing 
 Girl: 
 There were times when we'd lay in bed and listen 
 Both: 
 To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts 
 Boy: 
 Nothing could have torn us apart 
 Both: 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all ... 
 Both: 
 There were times when we fought like tigers 
 There were times we were damn good liars ... 
 There were times when we took our chances 
 There were times we were damn good dancers 
 Loving you's a dirty job 
 But somebody's gotta do it 
 There were times when we fought like tigers 
 There were times we were damn good liars 
 There were times we'd extinguish every fire 
 That was burning, burning, burning, up each other alive 
 Boy: 
 From the heavens on down to the dives 
 Both: 
 There were times we lost it all 
 There were times we lost it all ... 
 Boy: 
 There were times when our bodies glistened 
 There were times that we can't stop missing 
 There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen 
 To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts 
 Nothing could have torn us apart 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we lost it all ...Wasted Youth 
 Wasted Youth 
 I remember everything 
 I remember every little thing as if it only happened yesterday 
 I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a fender guitar 
 I don't remember if it was Telecaster or Stratocaster 
 But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny angel 
 I don't remember if it was Telecaster or Stratocaster 
 But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy 
 It required the perfect combination of the right powerchords 
 And the precise angle from which to strike! 
 The guitar bled fo about a week afterwards 
 And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berrys 
 The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red 
 The guitar bled for about a week afterwards 
 But it rung out beautifully 
 And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before 
 So I took my guitar 
 And I smashed it against the wall 
 I smashed it against the floor 
 I smashed it againt the body of a varsity cheerleader 
 Smashed it against the hood of a car 
 Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson 
 The Harley howled in pain 
 The guitar howled in heat 
 And I ran upstairs to my parents bedroom 
 Mummy and Daddy were sleeping quietly in the moonlight 
 Slowly I opened the door 
 Creeping into the shadows right up to the foot of their bed 
 I raised the guitar high above my head 
 And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the centre of the bed 
 My father woke up, screaming "STOP" 
 "Wait a minute, stop it boy. What do you think your doing?" 
 "That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument" 
 And I said "God damn it Daddy" 
 "You know I love you, But you've got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock 'n' Roll"Come with me and bless the night 
 Let the darkness be your salvation 
 Curse the day - escape the light 
 Break the chains of imagination 
 Come with me and seize the night 
 Now's the time for some inspiration 
 Leave the day and lose the light 
 No taboos only new sensations... 
 In the shadows of the city 
 A hero's waiting for the call 
 And all the angels are waking up 
 And all the devils start to fall 
 In the shadows of the city 
 They're dying for a thrill 
 They're going out over the edge 
 They're moving in for the kill 
 You gotta curse the day: it's nothing but a merciless light 
 So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees 
 You suck in all the darkness and you're ready now to seize 
 Seize the night 
 Seize the night 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Libera me, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Requiem da, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Libera me, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Requiem da, Domine! [etc.] 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Sanctus, Sanctus exultate! 
 Bless the night, before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last 
 Bless the night, before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last 
 Bless the night, before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last... 
 Let your dreams out of their cages 
 Every passion and desire 
 Let your visions be outrageous 
 Set your fantasies on fire 
 Everything will be permitted 
 There'll be nothing left to fear 
 I got the magic in your body 
 Your inhibitions disappear 
 You gotta curse the day: it's nothing but a merciless light 
 So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees 
 You suck in all the darkness and you're ready now to seize 
 Seize the night 
 Seize the night 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Libera me, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Requiem da, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Libera me, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Requiem da, Domine! [etc.] 
 Bless the night, before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last 
 Bless the night, memories collide to change the past 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last 
 Carpe Noctem... 
 Carpe Noctem... 
 Bless the night, before it has the chance to pass 
 Seize the night, you do what it takes to make it last... 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Requiem da, Domine! 
 Dies irae, Kyrie! Sanctus, Sanctus exultate! 
 Come with me and bless the night 
 Let the darkness be your salvation 
 Curse the day - escape the light 
 Break the chains of imagination 
 Come with me and seize the night 
 Now's the time for some inspiration 
 Leave the day and lose the light 
 No taboos only new sensations...Daddy told me that his daddy said his daddy said, "Son, 
 Don't be going down with any bullets left in your gun" 
 He looked me in the eye, said, "Boy, make up your mind" 
 Live or die-grab it by the horns and baby take that ride 
 Live or die-give it up or give it everything inside 
 Fall of fly-won't do a bit of good of asking why 
 There's only two choices in life-live or die 
 I just wanna go out going hundred miles a minute, oh 
 Take every second of this life and spend all I can in it 
 No, I ain't got time to sit and bitch and whine 
 Live or die-grab it by the horns and baby take that ride 
 Live or die-give it up or give it everything inside 
 Fall of fly-won't do a bit of good of asking why 
 There's only two choices in life-live or die... 
 Daddy told me that his daddy said his daddy said, "Son, 
 Don't be going down with any bullets left in your gun" 
 He said, now 
 Live or die-grab it by the horns and baby take that ride 
 Live or die-give it up or give it everything inside 
 Fall of fly-won't do a bit of good of asking why 
 There's only two choices in life-live or die 
 (Die)-never let a minute be a wasted time 
 Live or die-use it or lose it, make up your mind 
 Fall or fly-get on board or get left behind 
 There's only two choices in life-live or die 
 Oh now, live or die

 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man... 
 I was a man! 
 How's it feel to be a woman? 
 How's it feel to be a man? 
 Are we 
 really 
 that different? 
 Tell me where we stand. 
 I look at you, you look away. 
 Why do you say we're night and day? 
 I'd like to try another way. 
 Oh, baby! For just one day. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man, 
 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's a heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 How's it feel to be the hunter? 
 How's it feel to be the prey? 
 Is there 
 really 
 a reason 
 For this game we play? 
 I look at you, you look away. 
 Why do you say we're night and day? 
 I'd like to try another way. 
 Oh, darling, for just one day! 
 If you were a woman and I was a man, 
 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's a heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, hey! 
 We're just two people trying to love, 
 Oh, but how... how can we love? 
 With this wall between us... 
 Holding us! 
 Holding us back! 
 If you were a woman and I was a man, 
 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's a heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man, 
 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's a heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man.

 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man, 
 Would it be so hard to understand? 
 That a heart's a heart and we do what we can. 
 If you were a woman and I was a man. 
 I was a man!The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling 
 Way down in the valley tonight 
 There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
 And a blade shining oh so bright 
 There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky 
 And a killer's on the bloodshot streets 
 Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising 
 Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter 
 He was starting to foam in the heat 
 Oh baby, you're the only thing in this whole world 
 That's pure and good and right 
 And wherever you are and wherever you go 
 There's always gonna be some light 
 But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now 
 Before the final crack of dawn 
 So we gotta make the most of our one night together 
 When it's over, you know 
 We'll both be so alone 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 When the night is over 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone, gone, gone 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 But when the day is done and the sun goes down 
 And the moonlight's shining through 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram 
 On a silver black Phantom bike 
 When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry 
 And we're all about to see the light 
 Nothing ever grows in this rotten old hole 
 Everything is stunted and lost 
 And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls 
 And nothing's ever worth the cost 
 And I know that I'm damned if I never get out 
 And maybe I'm damned if I do 
 But with every other beat I've got left in my heart 
 You know I'd rather be damned with you 
 Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night with you 
 Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned 
 Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned 
 Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned 
 Dancing through the night 
 Dancing through the night 
 Dancing through the night with you 
 Oh baby, you're the only thing in this whole world 
 That's pure and good and right 
 And wherever you are and wherever you go 
 There's always gonna be some light 
 But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now 
 Before the final crack of dawn 
 So we gotta make the most of our one night together 
 When it's over, you know 
 We'll both be so alone 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 When the night is over 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone, gone, gone 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 But when the day is done and the sun goes down 
 And the moonlight's shining through 
 Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 And like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
 I'll come crawling on back to you 
 Oh, I can see myself tearing up the road 
 Faster than any other boy has ever gone 
 And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 
 And no one's gonna stop me now 
 I'm gonna make my escape 
 But I can't stop thinking of you 
 And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late 
 And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late 
 Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
 And the last thing I see is my heart 
 Still beating 
 Breaking out of my body and flying away 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 And I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
 Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
 And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
 And the last thing I see is my heart 
 Still beating 
 Still beating 
 Breaking out of my body and flying away 
 Like a bat out of hell 
 Oh, like a bat out of hell 
 Oh, like a bat out of hell 
 Oh, like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 Oh, like a bat out of hell 
 Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes 
 Oh, like a bat out of hellI stare in the mirror 
 My eyes refuse to blink 
 Sympathy for me 
 Hell I can't even think 
 Send for the iceman 
 My temperature is startin' to rise 
 I've heard it all before 
 I know the truth from the lies 
 Is it any wonder heaven's racked with thunder 
 And all of my dreams go under like the fallin' rain 
 Execution day 
 Voices that hover like locusts 
 Keep smothering me 
 Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea 
 Don't touch me now 
 Won't let you crucify me 
 You ain't no damn jury 
 You can't pass no sentence on me 
 Is it any wonder heaven's racked with thunder 
 And all of my dreams go under like the pourin' rain 
 Execution day 
 Execution day 
 Execution day 
 Execution day 
 Whose blood on whose hands 
 Where's the promises they preached for this land 
 Standin' there with bibles 
 Clutched in their hands 
 Whose blood on whose hands 
 Whose blood on whose hands 
 Father my hands are shakin' 
 I see a light that's breakin' 
 Show me the way to set my soul free 
 I hope it rains on me 
 Let it rain on me 
 Execution day 
 Execution day 
 Execution day 
 Execution day(There were times we had it all) 
 (There were times we lost it all) 
 When the sky is falling and you're looking 'round for somewhere to hide 
 Did you ever call out to someone? 
 Did you ever call out to me? 
 I've never been gone, I've been right here by your side 
 There ain't nothin' but clouds 
 There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes 
 Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth? 
 You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth 
 Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most? 
 You're so busy trying to get even, you never even try to get close 
 I can't explain it away 
 It doesn't make any sense 
 To know what it's like 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 It doesn't matter baby 
 Loving you's a dirty job 
 (It's a dirty job... but we can make it) 
 But somebody's gotta do it 
 There were times when we'd never fake it 
 There were times when we'd always make it 
 There were times when we'd take it to the limit 
 And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone 
 We were flesh and blood and bone 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times when we took our chances 
 There were times we were damn good dancers 
 There were times when we heard all the answers 
 In the beating of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll 
 I can see right through your soul 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 (It's a dirty job... but we can make it) 
 (Somebody's gotta do it) 
 If your fears could only be forgotten 
 We could pull all the barriers down 
 Would you follow your dream's desire? 
 Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire? 
 Let's just peel out of this town 
 It's been nothing but dreams 
 It's been nothing but dreams until now 
 You're never gonna see it 
 You got your head stuck in the sand 
 It's the land of the free and easy streets 
 It's the home of the damned 
 You're never gonna see it 
 You better open up your eyes 
 You're the only one who's left 
 Who's gonna believe all your lies 
 I can't explain it away 
 It doesn't make any sense 
 To know what it's like 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 I guess you gotta go through it 
 It doesn't matter baby 
 Loving you's a dirty job 
 (It's a dirty job... but we can make it) 
 But somebody's gotta do it 
 There were times when our bodies glistened 
 There were times that we can't stop missing 
 There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen 
 To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts 
 Nothing could have torn us apart 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times when we fought like tigers 
 There were times we were damn good liars 
 There were times we extinguished every fire 
 That was burning, burning, burning, up each other alive 
 From the heavens all down to the dives 
 There were times we lost it all 
 There were times we lost it all 
 (There were times when we fought like tigers) 
 (There were times we were damn good liars) 
 There were times when our bodies glistened 
 There were times that we can't stop missing 
 There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen 
 To the pounding, pounding, chorus of our desperate hearts 
 Nothing could have torn us apart 
 There were times we had it all 
 There were times we had it... all 
 (It's a dirty job... but we can make it) 
 (Somebody's gotta do it) 
 (There were times we had it all) 
 (There were times we lost it all)Boy: 
 Damn car broke down again, the heat just did the same 
 I can feel that cold winter wind creeping in again 
 Sometimes it all comes down at once 
 Sometimes when it rains, it pours 
 But I wouldn't trade my troubles for any one of yours, oh no, no 
 Girl: 
 Oh baby, money's just money, it comes and it goes 
 Things are just things, baby, so breakable 
 Ain't nothing last forever 'cept our love and our souls 
 Boy: 
 'Cause I ain't that hungry and I have a home 
 I ain't fighting for my life and I'm not alone, ooh 
 So may I pray every morning 
 As I make up the bed 
 "Lord, all I need today is my daily bread" 
 Girl: 
 Ooh darlin' don't you worry 
 'Cause money's just money, it comes and it goes 
 And things are just things, baby, so breakable 
 Ain't nothing last forever 'cept our love and our souls 
 Ah 
 Ah... 
 Both: 
 Money's just money, it comes and it goes 
 Things are just things, baby, so breakable 
 Ain't nothing last forever 'cept our love and our souls 
 Girl: Our souls...From the minute I turned and laid eyes on you 
 I had no eyes of my own I was blind to the world 
 You were to good to be true but you were something to see 
 So very young and alone 
 And still I don't believe the way you turned on me 
 Now where's the girl that I knew? 
 I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love 
 You gave me nothing but trouble man, I was such a fool 
 You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me? Let me count the ways 
 How many hours, in how many days? 
 How does it amuse you? Let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking, how many games? 
 How do you abuse me? Let me count the ways 
 How many hours, in how many days? 
 How does it amuse you? Let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking, how many games? 
 You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack 
 Go on and take all your stuff don't even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life 
 But I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close 
 And then you'd hold me so tight and in the wink of an eye 
 You used to give me it all and with a kiss in the darkness 
 You'd deliver the light 
 And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud 
 I know you're laughing at me oh, ain't it funny and sad 
 The way I fell for your lies the way I fell into love 
 And then begged to be free 
 You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you 
 You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you 
 How do you abuse me? Let me count the ways 
 How many hours, in how many days? 
 How does it amuse you? Let me count the pain 
 How many rules breaking, how many games? 
 You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack 
 Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack 
 In every way I want you out of my life 
 But I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach 
 They're dreamin' of boys and just out of reach 
 Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track 
 They're glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs 
 Bless all the girls in gangs on the street 
 They're looking for danger and they're holding their piece 
 Bless all the girls staying late after school 
 They're playing with fire and know they're playing it cool 
 And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance 
 They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance 
 Bless all the girls who are always alone 
 They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone 
 Bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights 
 And bless all the girls who know what love is about 
 They try not to cry and then they try to put out 
 And bless all the homecoming queens of the night 
 They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights 
 And bless all the girls who know what love is about 
 They try not to cry and then they try to put out 
 Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met 
 But damn you and curse you after all that you've done 
 You're the one girl I'll never forget 
 You're the one girl I'll never forget 
 Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do 
 But damn me and curse me for still needing you 
 And I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come back 
 I'll kill you if you don't come backFor the mighty oak to grow 
 You got to plant a tiny seed 
 Words are all you know 
 Body language is what you need 
 I can't barely breathe 
 Your fragrance fill my lungs 
 It's time we started speaking in tongues 
 Speaking in tongues ... 
 It's that time to start a fire 
 And I know we'll make it good 
 We're overflowing with desire 
 You got the spark - I've got wood 
 We got to let our voices soar 
 More than any song we've ever sung 
 It's time we started speaking in tongues 
 Speaking in tongues ... 
 There are things we learn by knowledge 
 There are things we learn by heart 
 There are things we learn at the end of life 
 There are things we learn at the start 
 There are things we learn by science 
 There are things we learn by art 
 There are things we learn from the fires of love 
 An erection of the heart 
 An erection of the heart 
 There are things we learn by knowledge 
 There are things we learn by heart 
 There are things we learn at the end of life 
 There are things we learn at the start 
 There are things we learn by science 
 There are things we learn by art 
 There are things we learn from the fires of love 
 An erection of the heart 
 An erection of the heart ... 
 For the mighty oak to grow 
 You got to plant a tiny seed 
 Words are all you know 
 Body language is what you need 
 We got to let our voices soar 
 More than any song we've ever sung 
 It's time we started speaking in tongues 
 Speaking in tongues ... 
 Speaking in tongues ...It's getting cold, it's getting dark 
 The nights are longer everyday 
 The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away 
 And we've been waiting here so long 
 That we've forgotten what it's like 
 To run into the fire lookin' straight into the 
 Straight into the light 
 Your heart is tryin' to rock 
 But it can barely beat at all 
 Your soul is tryin' to run 
 But all your body does is crawl 
 You don't need any signal 
 You don't need any sign 
 Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line 
 I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back 
 We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away 
 Breakin' away 
 Breakin' away 
 We're breakin' away from the pack 
 Oh breakin' away from the pack 
 And if you don't have anywhere to go 
 You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll 
 And even if you don't have anywhere to go 
 You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll 
 And your speed it's all you'll ever need 
 All you'll ever need to know 
 You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly 
 And we gotta get away from the past 
 There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby 
 But we should be goin' nowhere fast 
 Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly 
 They're only fighting for the chance to be last 
 There's nothing wrong with goin' nowhere baby 
 But we should be goin' nowhere fast 
 It's so much better goin' nowhere fast 
 You shouldn't always see your world so clearly 
 You shouldn't always know your place so well 
 And all we're doin' here is hangin' around 
 And goin' anywhere has got to be heaven 
 'Cause stayin' here is gonna be hell 
 And goin' anywhere has got to be heaven 
 'Cause stayin' here has gotta be hell 
 I'm getting lost, I'm getting found 
 I'm getting born again each day 
 We're dyin' on the vine until we finally 
 Till we finally get away 
 The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose 
 The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some 
 Put it to some use 
 Your heart is tryin' to rock 
 But it can barely beat at all 
 Your soul is tryin' to run 
 But all your body does is crawl 
 You don't need any signal 
 You don't need any sign 
 Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line 
 I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back

 I want my money back 
 It's all or nothing 
 And nothing's all I ever get 
 Every time I turn it on 
 I burn it up and burn it out 
 It's always something 
 There's always something going wrong 
 That's the only guarantee 
 That's what this is all about 
 It's a never ending attack 
 Everything's a lie and that's a fact 
 Life is a lemon 
 And I want my money back 
 And all the morons 
 And all the stooges with their coins 
 They're the ones who make the rules 
 It's not a game it's just a rout 
 There's desperation 
 There's desperation in the air 
 It leaves a stain on all your clothes 
 And no detergent gets it out 
 And we're always slipping through the cracks 
 Then the movie's over, fade to black 
 Life is a lemon 
 And I want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 What about love? 
 It's defective 
 It's always breaking in half 
 What about sex? 
 It's defective 
 It's never built to really last 
 What about your family? 
 It's defective 
 All the batteries are shot 
 What about your friends? 
 They're defective 
 All the parts are out of stock 
 What about hope? 
 It's defective 
 It's corroded and decayed 
 What about faith? 
 It's defective 
 It's tattered and it's frayed 
 What about your gods? 
 They're defective 
 They forgot the warranty 
 What about your town? 
 It's defective 
 It's a dead end street to me 
 What about your school? 
 It's defective 
 It's a pack of useless lies 
 What about your work? 
 It's defective 
 It's a crock and then you die 
 What about your childhood? 
 It's defective 
 It's dead and buried in the past 
 What about your future? 
 It's defective 
 And you can shove it up your ass 
 Oh, I want my money back 
 (Life is a lemon) 
 I want my money back 
 (Life is a lemon, life is a lemon) 
 It's all or nothing 
 And nothing's all I ever get

 Back, back, back, back 
 I want my money back 
 I want my money back 
 (Life is a lemon)I should have known better 
 Than to let you go alone 
 It's times like these 
 I can't make it on my own 
 Wasted days, and sleepless nights 
 An' I can't wait to see you again 
 I find I spend my time 
 Waiting on your call 
 How can I tell you, babe 
 My back's against the wall 
 I need you by my side 
 To tell me it's alright 
 'Cause I don't think I can take anymore 
 Is this love that I'm feeling 
 Is this the love that I've been searching for 
 Is this love or am I dreaming 
 This must be love 
 'Cause it's really got a hold on me 
 A hold on me 
 I can't stop the feeling 
 I've been this way before 
 But, with you I've found the key 
 To open any door 
 I can feel my love for you 
 Growing stronger day by day 
 An' I can't wait too see you again 
 So I can hold you in my arms 
 Is this love that I'm feeling 
 Is this the love that I've been searching for 
 Is this love or am I dreaming 
 This must be love 
 'Cause it's really got a hold on me 
 A hold on me 
 Is this love that I'm feeling 
 Is this the love that I've been searching for 
 Is this love or am I dreamingI could start dreaming but it never ends 
 As long as you're gone we may as well pretend 
 I've been dreaming 
 And that's straight from the heart 
 You said it's easy but who's to say 
 That we'd be able to keep it this way 
 But it's easier 
 Coming straight from the heart 
 Give it to me straight from the heart 
 Tell me we could make another start 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as I know 
 It's coming straight from the heart 
 I'll see you on the street some other time 
 But all our words will just fall out of line 
 While we're dreaming 
 Straight from the heart 
 Give it to me straight from the heart 
 Tell me we could make another start 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as I know 
 It's coming straight from the heart 
 Give it to me straight from the heart 
 Tell me we could make another start 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as lknow 
 It's coming straight from the heart 
 Give it to me straight from the heart 
 Tell me we could make another start 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as I know 
 It's coming straight from the heart 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as I know 
 It's coming straight from the heart 
 You know I'll never go 
 As long as I know 
 It's coming straight from the heartHoney there's something I've got to say to you 
 Oh I know I haven't told you before 
 But it wasn't until the other night 
 When you told me you loved me 
 That I felt that I should tell you this 
 You got a smile so bright 
 You know, you could have been a candle 
 You're holding me so tight 
 You know, you could have been a handle 
 The way you swept me off my feet 
 You know, you could have been a broom 
 The way you smell so sweet 
 You know, you could have been some perfume 
 Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to 
 And I can tell the way you do the things you do 
 (The way you do the things you do) 
 As pretty as you are 
 You know, you could have been a flower 
 If good looks caused a minute 
 Oh, you could have been an hour 
 The way you stole my heart 
 You know, you could have been a cool crook 
 And baby, you're so smart (baby you're so smart) 
 You know, you could have been a school book 
 Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to 
 And I can tell the way you do the things you do 
 (The way you do the things you do) 
 You made my life so rich 
 You know, you could have been some money 
 And baby, you're so sweet 
 You know, you should have been some honey 
 The way you stole my heart 
 You know, you could have been a cool crook 
 And baby, you're so smart (baby you're so smart) 
 You know, you could have been a school book 
 Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to 
 And I can tell the way you do the things you do 
 (The way you do the things you do) 
 The way you swept me off my feet 
 Oh, life is complete 
 You make my life so bright 
 Oh, you're gonna feel all right 
 The way you swept me off my feetI sold my soul to rock 'n' roll 
 When it didn't cost a thing 
 Stacked up scratched up 45's 
 And taught myself how to sing 
 What doesn't it take 
 To be a rock 'n' roll hero? 
 Just like the King 
 Livin' in a blaze of glory 
 Burnin' it up in a smoke filled club 
 Givin' your soul to the world 
 Like a rock 'n' roll hero 
 A soldier of fortune in the night 
 Like a r0ck 'n' roll hero 
 When the white-hot lights cut through the night 
 And the sound of the thunder starts rearing 
 That's when you know what you're saving it for 
 And you know the feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero 
 I owe it all to rock 'n' roll 
 And I wouldn't want to change a thing 
 Got this old guitar strapped 'round my neck 
 And my baby waitin' in the wings 
 What doesn't it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero? 
 Just like the king 
 Livin' in a blaze of glory 
 A spark in your eyes, a flame in your soul 
 Givin' your soul to the world 
 Like a rock 'n' roll hero 
 A soldier of fortune in the night 
 Like a rock 'n' roll hero 
 When the white-hot lights cut through the night 
 And the sound of the thunder starts rearing 
 That's when you know what you're saving it for 
 And you know the feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero...The skies were pure and the fields were green 
 And the sun was brighter than it's ever been 
 When I grew up with my best friend Kenny 
 We were close as any brothers that you ever knew 
 It was always summer and the future called 
 We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all 
 There was so much left to dream 
 And so much time to make it real 
 But I can still recall the sting of all 
 The tears when he was gone 
 They said, "He crashed and burned" 
 I know I'll never learn 
 Why any boy should die so young 
 We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune 
 We got in trouble but we sure got around 
 There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark 
 I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are, they are, they are 
 And when the sun descended and the night arose 
 I heard my father cursing everyone he knows 
 He was dangerous and drunk and defeated 
 And corroded by failure and envy and hate 
 There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze 
 Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees 
 And my father's eyes were blank 
 As he hit me again and again and again 
 I know I still believe he'd never let me leave 
 I had to run away alone 
 So many threats and fears, so many wasted years 
 Before my life became my own 
 And though the nightmares should be over 
 Some of the terrors are still intact 
 I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice 
 And then he grabs me from behind 
 And then he pulls me back 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 There was a beauty living on the edge of town 
 She always put the top up and the hammer down 
 And she taught me everything I'll ever know 
 About the mystery and the muscle of love 
 The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow 
 I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo 
 And the signs along the highway all said 
 "Caution! Kids at play" 
 Those were the rights of spring and we did everything 
 There was salvation every night 
 We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn 
 But everything we tried was right 
 She used her body just like a bandage 
 She used my body just like a wound 
 I'll probably never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now 
 Just like an angel rising up from a tomb 
 But it was long ago and it was far away 
 Oh God it seems so very far 
 And if life is just a highway 
 Then the soul is just a car 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 And objects in the rear view mirror 
 May appear closer than they are 
 She used her body just like a bandage 
 She used my body just like a wound 
 I'll never know where she disappeared 
 But I can see her rising up out of the back seat nowLost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner, and all around the world 
 Lost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner and all around, all around the world 
 It doesn't matter where they're going 
 Or wherever they've been 
 'Cause they've got one thing in common, it's true 
 They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste 
 And let me tell ya' something, neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 We've gotta' fast, we were born out of time 
 Born out of time and alone 
 And we'll never be as young as we are right now 
 Runnin' away and runnin' for home 
 Runnin' for home 
 It doesn't matter where they're going 
 Or wherever they've been 
 'Cause they've got one thing in common, it's true 
 They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste 
 And let me tell ya' something, neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 Neither will you 
 Lost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner, and all around the world 
 Lost boys and golden girls 
 Down on the corner and all around, and all around the world
