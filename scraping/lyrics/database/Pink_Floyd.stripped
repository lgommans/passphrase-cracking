As I reach for a peach 
 Slide a line down behind a sofa in San Tropez 
 Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand 
 Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan 
 Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness 
 Scratched by the sand that fell from my love 
 Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling 
 If youre alone Ill come hohohome 
 Backward and homebound the pigeon the dove 
 Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane 
 Born in a home with no silver spoon 
 Im drinking champagne like a good tycoon 
 Sooner than wait for a break in the weather 
 Ill gather my farflung thoughts together 
 Speeding away on a wind to a new day 
 And Ill pause for a while by a country stile 
 And listen to the things they say 
 Digging for gold in a hole in my hand 
 Open the book take a look at the way things stand 
 And youre leading me down to the place by the sea 
 I hear your soft voice calling to me 
 Making a date for later by phone 
 And if youre alone Ill come hohohomeOooh Ma Oooh Pa 
 Must the show go on 
 Oooh Pa take me home take me home take me home 
 Oooh Ma let me go let me go let me go 
 There must be some mistake 
 I didnt mean to let them 
 Take away my soul 
 Am I too old Is it too late 
 Oooh Ma Oooh Pa 
 Where has the feeling gone 
 Will I remember the songs 
 The show must go onAll movement is accomplished in six stages 
 And the seventh brings return 
 The seven is the number of the young light 
 It forms when darkness is increased by one 
 Change return success 
 Going and coming without error 
 Action brings good fortune 
 Sunset 
 The time is with the month of winter solstice 
 When the change is due to come 
 Thunder in the Earth the course of heaven 
 Things cannot be destroyed once and for all 
 Change returns success 
 Sunrise 
 A movement is accomplished in six stages 
 Sunrise Sunrise 
 SunriseRick 
 We certainly have an unspoken understanding 
 But a lot of things unsaid as well 
 David 
 Well we shout and argue and fight and work it on out 
 Nick 
 The sum is greater than the partsStop 
 I wanna go home 
 Take off this uniform 
 And leave the show 
 And Im waiting in this cell 
 Because I have to know 
 Have I been guilty all this timeRemember me 
 Ive been here before 
 Remember me 
 Cant you see 
 Im gonna stick around some more 
 I want some love from you 
 Dont go away now 
 Ive got something to give to you 
 Ill try to be 
 As good as gold to you 
 Try to be 
 But dont blame me girl 
 If Im far from cold to you 
 Come and stick around some more 
 YeahGoodbye cruel world 
 Im leaving you today 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye all you people 
 Theres nothing you can say 
 To make me change 
 My mind 
 GoodbyeOn the day the wall came down 
 They threw the locks onto the ground 
 And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived 
 On the day the wall came down 
 The Ship of Fools had finally run aground 
 Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight 
 I dreamed you had left my side 
 No warmth not even pride remained 
 And even though you needed me 
 It was clear that I could not do a thing for you 
 Now life devalues day by day 
 As friends and neighbours turn away 
 And theres a change that even with regret cannot be undone 
 Now frontiers shift like desert sands 
 While nations wash their bloodied hands 
 Of loyalty of history in shades of grey 
 I woke to the sound of drums 
 The music played the morning sun streamed in 
 I turned and I looked at you 
 And all but the bitter residue slipped away slipped awayI was spending my time in the doldrums 
 I was caught in a cauldron of hate 
 I felt persecuted and paralysed 
 I thought that everything else would just wait 
 While you are wasting your time on your enemies 
 Engulfed in a fever of spite 
 Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades 
 Like shadows into the night 
 To martyr yourself to caution 
 Is not going to help at all 
 Cause therell be no safety in numbers 
 When the right one walks out of the door 
 Can you see your days blighted by darkness 
 Is it true you beat your fists on the floor 
 Stuck in a world of isolation 
 While the ivy grows over the door 
 So I open my door to my enemies 
 And I ask could we wipe the slate clean 
 But they tell me to please go fuck myself 
 You know you just cant winSpoken Oh my God What a fabulous room Are all these your guitars 
 Film in background Im sorry sir I didnt mean to startle you 
 This place is bigger than our apartment 
 Film Let me know when youre entering a room 
 Yes sir 
 Um Can I get a drink of water 
 Film I was wondering about  
 You want some huh 
 Film Yes 
 Oh wow look at this tub Do you wanna take a bath 
 Film Ill have to find out from Mrs Bancroft what time she wants to meet us for her main  
 What are you watching 
 Film If youll just let me know as soon as you can  Mrs Bancroft Mrs Bancroft  
 Hello 
 Film I dont understand  
 Are you feeling okay 
 1 
 Day after day love turns grey 
 Like the skin of a dying man 
 And night after night we pretend its all right 
 2 
 But I have grown older and 
 You have grown colder and 
 Nothing is very much fun anymore 
 And I can feel one of my turns coming on 
 I feel cold as a razor blade 
 Tight as a tourniquet 
 Dry as a funeral drum 
 Run to the bedroom in the suitcase on the left 
 Youll find my favourite axe 
 Dont look so frightened 
 This is just a passing phase 
 One of my bad days 
 3 
 Would you like to watch TV 
 Or get between the sheets 
 Or contemplate the silent freeway 
 Would you like something to eat 
 Would you like to learn to fly Would you 
 4 
 Would you like to see me try Ooh no 
 5 
 Would you like to call the cops 
 Do you think its time I stopped 
 Why are you running awayInstrumental 
 Rise and Shine 
 Oh um flakes oh 
 Then uh I dont know scrambled eggs bacon sausages tomatoes 
 Toast coffee 
 Marmalade I like marmalade 
 Porridge is nice 
 Any cereal I like all cereal 
 Sunny Side Up 
 Breakfast in Los Angeles 
 Macrobiotic stuff 
 No reply 
 I dont mind the barrow 
 I like burying the stuff in 
 No Ive got a terrible back 
 When I work it hurts me 
 Do you know Elton John 
 Why he sort of a 
 When drivin on the radio to sleep 
 Getting ready for a gig 
 I dont know 
 He does that electrical stuff 
 I cant follow that 
 Morning Glory 
 Scrambled eggs bacon sausages tomatoes 
 I dont like coffee 
 What a day 
 What 
 My heads a blankThe sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land 
 Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky 
 A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers 
 But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking 
 Hes haunted by the memory of a lost paradise 
 In his youth or a dream he cant be precise 
 Hes chained forever to a world thats departed 
 Its not enough its not enough 
 His blood has frozen and curdled with fright 
 His knees have trembled and given way in the night 
 His hand has weakened at the moment of truth 
 His step has faltered 
 One world one soul 
 Time pass the river rolls 
 Its not enough Its not enough 
 And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication 
 And silent replies that swirl invitation 
 Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea 
 A grim intimation of what is to be 
 Theres an unceasing wind that blows through this night 
 And theres dust in my eyes that blinds my sight 
 And silence that speaks so much louder than words 
 Of promises brokenTicking away the moments that make up a dull day 
 Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way 
 Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
 Waiting for someone or something to show you the way 
 Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain 
 And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today 
 And then one day you find ten years have got behind you 
 No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun 
 And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking 
 Racing around to come up behind you again 
 The sun is the same in a relative way but youre older 
 Shorter of breath and one day closer to death 
 Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time 
 Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
 Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
 The time is gone the song is over thought Id something more to say 
 Breathe Reprise 
 Home home again 
 I like to be here when I can 
 When I come home cold and tired 
 1 
 Its good to warm my bones beside the fire 
 Far away across the field 
 The tolling of the iron bell 
 Calls the faithful to their knees 
 To hear the softly spoken magic spellFrom morning to night I stayed out of sight 
 Didnt recognise Id become 
 No more than alive Id barely survive 
 In a word overrun 
 Wont hear a sound Hes curled into the corner 
 From my mouth But still the screen is flickering 
 Ive spent too long With an endless stream of garbage to 
 On the inside out curse the place 
 My skin is cold In a sea of random images 
 To the human touch The selfdestructing animal 
 This bleeding hearts Waiting for the waves to break 
 Not beating much 
 I murmured a vow of silence and now 
 I dont even hear when I think aloud 
 Extinguished by light I turn on the night 
 Wear its darkness with an empty smile 
 Im creeping back to life 
 My nervous system all awry 
 Im wearing the inside out 
 Look at him now 
 Hes paler somehow 
 But hes coming round 
 Hes starting to choke 
 Its been so long since he spoke 
 Well he can have the words right from my mouth 
 And with these words I can see 
 Clear through the clouds that covered me 
 Just give it time then speak my name 
 Now we can hear ourselves again 
 Im holding out Hes standing on the threshold 
 For the day Caught in fiery anger 
 When all the clouds And hurled into the furnace hell 
 Have blown away curse the place 
 Im with you now Hes torn in all directions 
 Can speak your name And still the screen is flickering 
 Now we can hear Waiting for the flames to break 
 Ourselves againspoken 
 Pass the tequila Manuel 
 Listen gringo 
 Laugh at my lisp and I kill you 
 I think 
 Ah this Spanish music 
 It sets my soul on fire 
 Lovely senorita 
 Your eyes are like stars 
 Your teeth are like pearls 
 Your ruby lipsCorporal Clegg had a wooden leg 
 He won it in the war 
 In nineteen forty four 
 Corporal Clegg had a medal too 
 In orange red and blue 
 He found it in the zoo 
 Dear oh dear oh are they really sad for me 
 Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me 
 Missus Clegg you must be proud of him 
 Missus Clegg another drop of gin 
 Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain 
 Hes never been the same 
 No one is to blame 
 Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream 
 From her Majesty the Queen 
 His boots were very clean 
 Corporal Clegg 
 Johnny 
 Johnny is on guard 
 All right men  in you go 
 Left right left right 
 Im right behind you 
 What are you speaking of About that leg of yours 
 Youll excuse me from now on what of it 
 Ha We got him 
 Johnny Cleggs dead 
 Corporal CleggOiGet your filthy hands off my desert 
 What e say 
 Brezhnev took Afghanistan 
 And Begin took Beirut 
 Galtieri took the Union Jack 
 And Maggie over lunch one day 
 Took a cruiser with all hands 
 Apparently to make him give it backHeaven sent the promised land 
 Looks alright from where I stand 
 Cause Im the man on the outside looking in 
 Waiting on the first step 
 Show me where the key is kept 
 Point me down the right line because its time 
 To let me in from the cold 
 Turn my lead into gold 
 Cause theres a chill wind blowing in my soul 
 And I think Im growing old 
 Flash the readies 
 Wots uh the deal 
 Got to make it to the next meal 
 Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel 
 Mile after mile stone after stone 
 You turn to speak but youre alone 
 Million miles from home youre on your own 
 So let me in from the cold 
 Fire bright by candle light 
 With her by my side 
 And if she prefers we need never stir again 
 Someone sent the promised land 
 And I grabbed it with both hands 
 Now Im the man on the inside looking out 
 Hear me shout Come on in 
 Whats the news and where you been 
 Cause theres no wind left in my soul 
 And Ive grown oldThe path you tread is narrow 
 And the drop is sheer and very high 
 The ravens all are watching 
 From a vantage point nearby 
 Apprehension creeping 
 Like a tubetrain up your spine 
 Will the tightrope reach the end 
 Will the final couplet rhyme 
 And its high time Cymbaline 
 Its high time Cymbaline 
 Please wake me 
 A butterfly with broken wings 
 Is falling by your side 
 The ravens all are closing in 
 Theres nowhere you can hide 
 Your manager and agent 
 Are both busy on the phone 
 Selling coloured photographs 
 To magazines back home 
 The lines converging where you stand 
 They must have moved the picture plane 
 The leaves are heavy around your feet 
 You hear the thunder of the train 
 Suddenly it strikes you 
 That theyre moving into range 
 And Doctor Strange 
 Is always changing size 
 Please wake meThrough the fisheyed lens of tear stained eyes 
 I can barely define the shape of this moment in time 
 And far from flying high in clear blue skies 
 Im spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide 
 If you negotiate the minefield in the drive 
 And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes 
 And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall 
 Dial the combination open the priesthole 
 And if Im in Ill tell you whats behind 
 the wall 
 gunshot which obscures the wall 
 Theres a kid who had a big hallucination 
 Making love to girls in magazines 
 He wonders if youre sleeping with your new found faith 
 Could anybody love him or is it just a crazy dream 
 And if I show you my dark side 
 Will you still hold me tonight 
 And if I open my heart to you 
 And show you my weak side 
 What would you do 
 Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone 
 Would you take the children away and leave me alone 
 And smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone 
 Would you send me packing or would you take me home 
 Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings 
 Thought I oughta tear the curtain down 
 I held the blade in trembling hands 
 Prepared to make it but 
 Just then the phone rang 
 I never had the nerve to make the final cut 
 Hello Listen I think Ive got it Okay listen Its a Ha ha haLast night I had too much to drink 
 Sitting in a club with so many fools 
 Playing to rules 
 Trying to impress but feeling rather empty 
 I had another drink 
 Drink  a  drink  a  drink  a  drink 
 What a way to spend that evening 
 They all turn up with their friends 
 Playing the game 
 Theyre in the scene always should have been 
 Far away 
 Away  away  away  away  away 
 Getting up I feel as if Im remembering this scene before 
 I open the door to an empty room 
 Then I forget 
 Pretend the phone rings and someone speaks 
 She would very much like to go out to a show 
 So what can I do  I cant think of what to say 
 She sees through anyway 
 Out of the front door I go 
 Traffics moving rather slow 
 Arriving late there she waits 
 Looking very angry as cross as she can be 
 Be  a  be  a  be  a  be  a  be 
 Then I forgetIn my rear view mirror the sun is going down 
 Sinking behind bridges in the road 
 I think of all the good things that we have left undone 
 And I suffer premonitions 
 Confirm suspicions 
 Of the holocaust to come 
 The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in 
 Gives way and suddenly its day again 
 The sun is in the east even though the day is done 
 Two suns in the sunset 
 Could be the human race is run 
 Like the moment when the brakes lock 
 And you slide towards the big truck 
 Oh no 
 You stretch the frozen moments with your fear 
 And youll never hear their voices 
 Daddy Daddy 
 And youll never see their faces 
 You have no recourse to the law anymore 
 And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate 
 Leaving only charcoal to defend 
 Finally I understand the feelings of the few 
 Ashes and diamonds 
 Foe and friend 
 We were all equal in the end 
 and now the weather Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east  with an expected high of 4000 degrees CelsiusSo so you think you can tell 
 Heaven from Hell blue skies from pain 
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail 
 A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell 
 Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts 
 Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze 
 Cold comfort for change Did you exchange 
 A walkon part in the war for a lead role in a cage 
 How I wish how I wish you were here 
 Were just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year 
 Running over the same old ground what have we found 
 The same old fears 
 Wish you were hereYou say the hills too steep to climb 
 Chiding 
 You say youd like to see me try 
 Climbing 
 You pick the place and Ill choose the time 
 And Ill climb the hill in my own way 
 Just wait a while for the right day 
 And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds 
 I look down hear the sound of the things you said today 
 Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd 
 Smiling 
 Merciless the magistrate turns round 
 Frowning 
 And whos the fool who wears the crown 
 No doubt in your own way 
 And every day is the right day 
 And as you rise above the fear lines in his brow 
 You look down hear the sound of the faces in the crowd 
 Walk on walk on with hope in your heart 
 And youll never walk alone 
 Youll never walk alone 
 Walk on walk on with hope in your heart 
 Liverpool 
 Liverpooldont forget your hand luggage have your passports ready Then follow the green line to customs and then to emigration 
 BA twoonefive to Rome 
 May I have your attention please Here is an announcement for BOAC passengers on BA twoonefive to Romedont forget your hand luggage have your passports ready 
 Live for today gone tomorrow thats me HahahaaaaaaWould you like to say something before you leave 
 Perhaps youd care to state exactly how you feel 
 We say goodbye before we said hello 
 I hardly even like you I shouldnt care at all 
 We met just six hours ago the music was too loud 
 From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year 
 And I would like to know 
 How do you feel how do you feel 
 Not a single word was said the night still hid our fears 
 Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need 
 I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninetyfive 
 My friends are lying in the sun I wish that I was there 
 Tomorrow brings another town another girl like you 
 Have you time before you leave to greet another man 
 Just you let me know 
 Goodbye to you 
 Charlotte Pringles due 
 Ive had enough for one daya group of business men announced plans to build a nuclear fallout shelter at Peterborough in Cambridgeshire 
 three high court judges have cleared the way to 
 it was announced today that the replacement for the Atlantic Conveyor the container ship lost in Falklands conflict 
 would be built in Japan A spokesman for 
 moving in They say the third world countries like Bolivia which produce the drug are suffering from rising violence 
 Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified 
 Was it for this that Daddy died 
 Was it you Was it me 
 Did I watch too much TV 
 Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes 
 If it wasnt for the Nips 
 Being so good at building ships 
 The yards would still be open on the Clyde 
 And it cant be much fun for them 
 Beneath the rising sun 
 With all their kids committing suicide 
 What have we done Maggie what have we done 
 What have we done to England 
 Should we shout Should we scream 
 What happened to the post war dream 
 Oh Maggie Maggie what have we doneIve got a bike you can ride it if you like 
 Its got a basket a bell that rings 
 And things to make it look good 
 Id give it to you if I could but I borrowed it 
 Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 Ill give you anything everything if you want things 
 Ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke 
 Theres a tear up the front its red and black 
 Ive had it for months 
 If you think it could look good then I guess it should 
 I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house 
 I dont know why I call him Gerald 
 Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse 
 Ive got a clan of gingerbread men 
 Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men 
 Take a couple if you wish theyre on the dish 
 I know a room of musical tunes 
 Some rhyme some ching most of them are clockwork 
 Lets go into the other room and make them workHello 
 Is there anybody in there 
 Just nod if you can hear me 
 Is there anyone home 
 Come on now 
 I hear youre feeling down 
 I can ease your pain 
 And get you on your feet again 
 Relax 
 Ill need some information first 
 Just the basic facts 
 Can you show me where it hurts 
 There is no pain you are receding 
 A distant ship smoke on the horizon 
 You are only coming through in waves 
 Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying 
 When I was a child I had a fever 
 My hands felt just like two balloons 
 Now Ive got that feeling once again 
 I cant explain you would not understand 
 This is not how I am 
 I have become comfortably numb 
 OK 
 Just a little pinprick 
 Therell be no more aaaaaaaah 
 But you may feel a little sick 
 Can you stand up 
 I do believe its working good 
 Thatll keep you going through the show 
 Come on its time to go 
 When I was a child 
 I caught a fleeting glimpse 
 Out of the corner of my eye 
 I turned to look but it was gone 
 I cannot put my finger on it now 
 The child is grown 
 The dream is gone 
 I have become comfortably numbStay 
 And help me to end the day 
 And if you dont mind 
 Well break a bottle of wine 
 Stick around 
 And maybe well put one down 
 Cause I wanna find 
 What lies behind those eyes 
 Midnight blue burning gold 
 A yellow moon is growing cold 
 I rise 
 Looking through my morning eyes 
 Surprised 
 To find you by my side 
 Rack my brain 
 And try to remember your name 
 To find 
 The words to tell you goodbye 
 Morning dues new born day 
 Midnight blue turned to grey 
 A yellow moon is growing coldSo ya thought ya might like to go to the show 
 To feel the warm thrill of confusion that space cadet glow 
 Ive got some bad news for you sunshine 
 Pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel 
 And they sent us along as a surrogate band 
 And were going to find out where you fans really stand 
 Are there any queers in the theater tonight 
 Get em up against the wall Against the wall 
 Theres one in the spotlight he dont look right to me 
 Get him up against the wall Against the wall 
 That one looks Jewish and that ones a coon 
 Who let all of this riffraff into the room 
 Theres one smoking a joint and another with spots 
 If I had my way Id have all of you shotOne two free four 
 The memories of a man in his old age 
 Are the deeds of a man in his prime 
 You shuffle in the gloom of the sick room 
 And talk to yourself as you die 
 Life is a short warm moment 
 And death is a long cold rest 
 You get your chance to try 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 Eighty years with luck or even less 
 So all aboard for the American tour 
 And maybe youll make it to the top 
 But mind how you go 
 And I can tell you cos I know 
 You may find it hard to get off 
 But you are the angel of death 
 And I am the dead mans son 
 He was buried like a mole in a foxhole 
 And everyones still in the run 
 And who is the master of foxhounds 
 And who says the hunt has begun 
 And who calls the tune in the courtroom 
 And who beats the funeral drum 
 And talk to yourself as you dieThe lunatic is on the grass 
 The lunatic is on the grass 
 Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs 
 Got to keep the loonies on the path 
 The lunatic is in the hall 
 The lunatics are in my hall 
 The paper holds their folded faces to the floor 
 And every day the paper boy brings more 
 And if the dam breaks open many years too soon 
 And if there is no room upon the hill 
 And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too 
 Ill see you on the dark side of the moon 
 The lunatic is in my head 
 You raise the blade you make the change 
 You rearrange me till Im sane 
 You lock the door 
 And throw away the key 
 Theres someone in my head but its not me 
 And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear 
 You shout and no one seems to hear 
 And if the band youre in starts playing different tunes 
 I cant think of anything to say except Hahahaha Hahahaha 
 I think its marvelous 
 HahahaFollowing the path as it leads towards 
 The darkness in the North 
 Weary strangers faces show their sympathy 
 Theyve seen that hope before 
 But if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
 Before you the night is beckoning 
 And you know you cant delay 
 You hear the night birds calling you 
 But you cant catch the words they say 
 Close your ears and eyes be on your way 
 Mist is swirling creatures crawling 
 Hear the roar get louder in your ears 
 You know the folly was your own 
 But the force behind cant conquer all your fears 
 And if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Pull your thoughts back many years 
 To the time when there was life with every morning 
 Perhaps a day will come 
 When the light will be as clear as on that morning 
 Close your ears and eyes be on your wayBreathe breathe in the air 
 Dont be afraid to care 
 Leave but dont leave me 
 Look around choose your own ground 
 For long you live and high you fly 
 And smiles youll give and tears youll cry 
 And all you touch and all you see 
 Is all your life will ever be 
 Run rabbit run 
 Dig that hole forget the sun 
 And when at last the work is done 
 Dont sit down its time to dig another one 
 But only if you ride the tide 
 And balanced on the biggest wave 
 You race towards an early graveRemember a day before today 
 A day when you were young 
 Free to play along with time 
 Evening never comes 
 Sing a song that cant be sung 
 Without the mornings kiss 
 Queen you shall be if you wish 
 Look for your King 
 Why cant we play today 
 Why cant we stay that way 
 Climb your favourite apple tree 
 Try to catch the sun 
 Hide from your little brothers gun 
 Dream yourself away 
 Why cant we reach the sun 
 Why cant we blow the years away 
 Blow away 
 Remember 
 RememberListen all you girlies 
 Even though I havent met you 
 Gonna catch you soon 
 In my butterfly net 
 Youd better watch out 
 Sometimes when I watch you 
 I stretch out my hand to touch you 
 Cause it drives my me wild 
 To see you flutter by 
 You butterfly 
 I wont squeeze you dead 
 Aiming through your head 
 I just want your love 
 I wont cry your name 
 In Latin in the rain 
 Cause raining its a shame 
 Listen all you girlies 
 Youd better watch outOne sound one single sound 
 One kiss one single kiss 
 A face outside the window pane 
 However did it come to this 
 A man who ran a child who cried 
 A girl who heard a voice that lied 
 The sun that burned a fiery red 
 The vision of an empty bed 
 The use of force he was so tough 
 Shell soon submit shes had enough 
 The march of fate the broken will 
 Someone is lying very still 
 He has laughed and he has cried 
 He has fought and he has died 
 Hes just the same as all the rest 
 Hes not the worst and hes not the best 
 And still this ceaseless murmuring 
 The babbling that I brook 
 The seas of faces eyes upraised 
 The empty screen the vacant look 
 A man in black on a snow white horse 
 A pointless life has run its course 
 The red rimmed eyes the tears still run 
 As he fades into the setting sunNobody knows where you are 
 How near or how far 
 Shine on you crazy diamond 
 Pile on many more layers 
 And Ill be joining you there 
 And well bask in the shadow of yesterdays triumph 
 Sail on the steel breeze 
 Come on you boy child you winner and loser 
 Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shineMamma loves her baby 
 And daddy loves you too 
 And the sea may look warm to you babe 
 And the sky may look blue 
 Ooooh babe 
 Ooooh baby blue 
 Ooooh ooooh babe 
 If you should go skating 
 On the thin ice of modern life 
 Dragging behind you the silent reproach 
 Of a million tear stained eyes 
 Dont be surprised when a crack in the ice 
 Appears under your feet 
 You slip out of your depth and out of your mind 
 With your fear flowing out behind you 
 As you claw the thin iceIf you didnt care what happened to me 
 And I didnt care for you 
 We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain 
 Occasionally glancing up through the rain 
 Wondering which of the buggers to blame 
 And watching for pigs on the wingBo Diddley was a private eye 
 Hand was fast and his IQ high 
 DA said Double O you wont last 
 Slow down boy you living too fast 
 Well Double O had a Cadillac 
 Machine guns and a bulletproof back 
 Engine taken from a 707 
 Sounds like a sure way to get into heaven 
 In his pocket 5 pounds of lead 
 Keep Bo Diddley from getting dead 
 Another thing helped Bo keeping alive 
 Was a snubnosed Smith And Wesson Colt 45 
 Well Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon 
 Martinis dry and you better serve them 
 Martini so dry the shaker burst 
 Bo keeled on his side and died of thirstEins zwei drei alle 
 Ooh you cannot reach me now 
 Ooh no matter how you try 
 Goodbye cruel world its over 
 Walk on by 
 Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall 
 Waiting for the worms to come Worms to come 
 In perfect isolation here behind my wall 
 Will the Audience convene at one fifteen outside Brixton town hall where we will be going 
 Waiting to cut out the deadwood 
 Waiting to clean up the city 
 Waiting to follow the worms 
 Waiting to put on a black shirt 
 Waiting to weed out the weaklings 
 Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors 
 Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain 
 Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens 
 Waiting for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews 
 Would you like to see Britannia Rule again my friend 
 All you have to do is follow the worms 
 Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again my friend 
 All you need to do is follow the worms 
 The Worms will convene outside Brixton Town Hall Well be moving along at about 12 oclock down Stockwell Road and then well cross at Abbots Road and well be covering some distance twelve minutes to three well be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge were in Westminster Borough  area Its quite possible we may encounter some Jew boys and from now on weve got to be careful by the way we go At eighteen after midday well all be at Hyde Park and there well continue

 Lying on an eiderdown yippee 
 You cant see me but I can you 
 Lazing in the foggy dew 
 Sitting on a unicorn no fear 
 You cant hear me but I can you 
 Watching buttercups cup the light 
 Sleeping on a dandelion too much 
 I wont touch you but then I might 
 Screaming through the starlit skies 
 Traveling by telephone 
 Hey ho here we go 
 Ever so high 
 Alone in the clouds all blue 
 You cant see me but I can youMoney get away 
 Get a good job with more pay and youre okay 
 Money its a gas 
 Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash 
 New car caviar four star daydream 
 Think Ill buy me a football team 
 Money get back 
 Im all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack 
 Money its a hit 
 Dont give me that do goody good bullshit 
 Im in the hifidelity first class travelling set 
 And I think I need a Lear jet 
 Money its a crime 
 Share it fairly but dont take a slice of my pie 
 Money so they say 
 Is the root of all evil today 
 But if you ask for a rise its no surprise that theyre 
 Giving none away 
 Away away away away away away away 
 Yeah I was in the right 
 Yes absolutely in the right 
 I certainly was in the right 
 Yeah I was definitely in the right That geezer was cruising for a bruising 
 Why does anyone do anything

 I dont know I was really drunk at the time 
 I was just telling him it was in he could get it in number two He was asking why it wasnt coming up on fader eleven After I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasnt coming up on fader eleven It came to a heavy blow which sorted the matter outOoooh babe 
 Dont leave me now 
 Dont say its the end of the road 
 Remember the flowers I sent 
 I need you babe 
 To put through the shredder 
 In front of my friends 
 Ooooh babe 
 How could you go 
 When you know how I need you 
 To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night 
 How can you treat me this way 
 Running away 
 Why are you running away 
 Ooooooh babe 
 Spoken Sound of many TVs coming on all on different channels 
 The Bulls are already out there 
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh 
 This room will be a bakery Thought youd like to know 
 3They flutter behind you your possible pasts 
 Some brighteyed and crazy some frightened and lost 
 A warning to anyone still in command 
 Ranks fire 
 Of their possible future to take care 
 In derelict sidings the poppies entwine 
 With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time 
 Do you remember me How we used to be 
 Do you think we should be closer 
 How are you tonight 
 She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile 
 Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign 
 Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs 
 For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs 
 Stepping up boldly one put out his hand 
 He said I was just a child then now Im only a man 
 By the cold and religious we were taken in hand 
 Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad 
 Strung out behind us the banners and flags 
 Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags 
 Do you think we should be closerIcy wind of night be gone 
 This is not your domain 
 In the sky a bird was heard to cry 
 Misty morning whisperings 
 And gentle stirring sounds 
 Belied a deathly silence 
 That lay all around 
 Hear the lark and harken 
 To the barking of the dog fox 
 Gone to ground 
 See the splashing 
 Of the kingfisher flashing to the water 
 And a river of green is sliding 
 Unseen beneath the trees 
 Laughing as it passes 
 Through the endless summer 
 Making for the sea 
 In the lazy water meadow 
 I lay me down 
 All around me golden sunflakes 
 Settle on the ground 
 Basking in the sunshine 
 Of a bygone afternoon 
 Bringing sounds of yesterday 
 Into this city room 
 Covering the ground 
 Into my city room 
 A river of green is sliding 
 Making for the seaSpoken chanted Pink Floyd Pink Floyd 
 Run run run run 
 You better make your face up in your favourite disguise 
 With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes 
 With your empty smile and your hungry heart 
 Feel the bile rising from your guilty past 
 With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters 
 And the hammers batter down the door 
 You better run 
 You better run all day and run all night 
 And keep your dirty feelings deep inside 
 And if youre taking your girlfriend out tonight 
 You better park the car well out of sight 
 Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks 
 Theyre gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box 
 Spoken Hey open up HaHaHaHaHaaaaaaaaaa 
 sound of car skidding followed by loud scream 
 chanting Hammer Hammer 
 1Floating down through the clouds 
 Memories come rushing up to meet me now 
 But in the space between the heavens and the corner of some foreign field 
 I had a dream I had a dream 
 Goodbye Max goodbye Ma 
 After the service when youre walking slowly to the car 
 And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air 
 You hear the tolling bell 
 And touch the silk in your lapel 
 And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band 
 You take her frail hand 
 And hold on to the dream 
 A place to stay 
 Oi A real one  
 Enough to eat 
 Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street 
 Where you can speak out loud 
 About your doubts and fears 
 And whats more no one ever disappears 
 You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door 
 You can relax on both sides of the tracks 
 And maniacs dont blow holes in bandsmen by remote control 
 And everyone has recourse to the law 
 And no one kills the children anymore 
 Night after night 
 Going round and round my brain 
 His dream is driving me insane 
 In the corner of some foreign field 
 The gunner sleeps tonight 
 Whats done is done 
 We cannot just write off his final scene 
 Take heed of the dream 
 Take heedDoctor doctor Im in bed 
 Doctor doctor aching head 
 Doctor doctor gold is lead 
 Doctor doctor choke on bread 
 Doctor doctor underfed 
 Doctor doctor Jesus bled 
 Doctor doctor pain is red 
 Doctor doctor dark doom 
 Gruel ghoul greasy spoon 
 Used spool June gloom 
 Why do you go 
 And now 
 Music seems to help the pain 
 Seems to motivate the brain 
 Doctor kindly tell your wife 
 That Im alive flowers thrive 
 Realise realise 
 RealiseCome in here dear boy have a cigar youre gonna go far 
 Youre gonna fly high youre never gonna die 
 Youre gonna make it if you try theyre gonna love you 
 Well Ive always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincerely 
 The band is just fantastic that is really what I think 
 Oh by the way  which ones Pink 
 And did we tell you the name of the game boy 
 We call it Riding the Gravy Train 
 Were just knocked out we heard about the sell out 
 You gotta get an album out you owe it to the people 
 Were so happy we can hardly count 
 Everybody else is just green have you seen the chart 
 Its a hell of a start it could be made into a monster 
 If we all pull together as a team 
 Disciplinary it remains mercifully 
 Yes and then Derek this star nonsense 
 Yes yes 
 Now which is it 
 Im sure of itLucifer Sam Siam cat 
 Always sitting by your side 
 Always by your side

 Jennifer Gentle youre a witch 
 Youre the left side

 Dont leave the children on their own no no 
 Spoken Wrong Do it again 
 Time to go knock knock knock knock 
 See He keeps hanging up and its a man answering 
 Is there anybody out there 
 3Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze 
 I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea 
 I was thinking all about her burning with rage and desire 
 We were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire 
 She could take it back she might take it back someday 
 So I spied on her I lied to her I made promises I cannot keep 
 Then I hear her laughter rising rising from the deep 
 And I make her prove her love for me I take all that I can take 
 And I push her to the limit to see if she will break 
 She might take it back she could take it back some day 
 Ring a ring o roses 
 A pocket full of posies 
 Atishoo atishoo 
 We all fall down 
 Now I have seen the warnings screaming from all sides 
 Its easy to ignore them and God 
 knows Ive tried 
 All of this temptation it turned my faith to lies 
 Until I couldnt see the danger or hear the rising tide 
 She can take it back she will take it back some day 
 She will take it back she will take it back some dayHome home again 
 Calls the faithfull

 To hear the softly spoken magic spellsSpoken You yes you Stand still laddy 
 When we grew up and went to school 
 There were certain teachers who would 
 Hurt the children any way they could 
 By pouring their derision 
 Upon anything we did 
 And exposing every weakness 
 However carefully hidden by the kids 
 But in the town it was well known 
 When they got home at night their fat and 
 Psychopathic wives would thrash them 
 Within inches of their livesCome on my friends lets make for the hills 
 They say theres gold but Im looking for thrills 
 You can get your hands on whatever we find 
 Cause Im only coming along for the ride 
 Well you go your way Ill go mine 
 I dont care if we get there on time 
 Everybodys searching for something they say 
 Ill get my kicks on the way 
 Over the mountains across the sea 
 Who knows what may be waiting for me 
 I can sail forever to strange sounding names 
 Faces of people and places dont change 
 All I have to do is just close my eyes 
 To see the sea gulls wheeling in those far distant skies 
 All I wanna tell you all I wanna say 
 Is count me in on the journey 
 Dont expect me to stayWelcome my son 
 Welcome to the machine 
 Where have you been 
 Its all right we know where youve been 
 Youve been in the pipeline filling in time 
 Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys 
 You bought a guitar to punish your ma 
 You didnt like school and you know youre nobodys fool 
 So welcome to the machine 
 Welcome my son 
 What did you dream 
 Its all right we told you what to dream 
 You dreamed of a big star 
 He played a mean guitar 
 He always ate in the steak bar 
 He loved to drive in his Jaguar 
 So welcome to the machineArnold Layne had a strange hobby 
 Collecting clothes 
 Moonshine washing line 
 They suit him fine 
 On the wall hung a tall mirror 
 Distorted view 
 Seethrough baby blue 
 He dug it 
 Oh Arnold Layne its not the same 
 Takes two to know 
 Two to know 
 Why cant you see 
 Arnold Layne 
 Now hes caught a nasty sort of person 
 They gave him time 
 Doors bang chain gang 
 He hates it 
 Arnold Layne dont do it againA cloud of eiderdown draws around me softening the sound 
 Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side and shes breathing low 
 And the candle dies 
 When night comes down you lock the door 
 The book falls to the floor 
 As darkness falls and waves roll by 
 The seasons change the wind is warm 
 Now wakes the owl now sleeps the swan 
 Behold a dream the dream is gone 
 Green fields a cold rain is falling 
 In a golden dawn 
 And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds and I go down 
 And I rise like a bird in the haze when the first rays touch the sky 
 And the night winds dieJesus Jesus whats it all about 
 Tryin to clout these little ingrates into shape 
 When I was their age all the lights went out 
 There was no time to whine or mope about 
 And even now part of me flies over 
 Dresden at angels one five 
 Though theyll never fathom it behind my 
 Sarcasm desperate memories lie 
 Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep 
 Good 
 Thats the only time that I can really speak to you 
 And theres something that Ive locked away 
 A memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day 
 When we came back from the war 
 The banners and flags hung on everyones door 
 We danced and we sang in the streets 
 And the church bells ring 
 But burning in my heart 
 My memory smolders on 
 Of the gunners dying words 
 On the intercomI dont need no arms around me 
 And I dont need no drugs to calm me 
 I have seen the writing on the wall 
 Dont think I need anything at all 
 No dont think Ill need anything at all 
 All in all it was all just bricks in the wall 
 All in all you were all just bricks in the wallYou gotta be crazy you gotta have a real need 
 You gotta sleep on your toes and when youre on the street 
 You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed 
 And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight 
 You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking 
 And after a while you can work on points for style 
 Like the club tie and the firm handshake 
 A certain look in the eye and an easy smile 
 You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to 
 So that when they turn their backs on you 
 Youll get the chance to put the knife in 
 You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder 
 You know its going to get harder and harder and harder as you get older 
 And in the end youll pack up and fly down south hide your head in the sand 
 Just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer 
 And when you lose control youll reap the harvest you have sown 
 And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone 
 And its too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around 
 So have a good drown as you go down all alone 
 Dragged down by the stone 
 2 
 I gotta admit that Im a little bit confused 
 Sometimes it seems to me as if Im just being used 
 Gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise 
 If I dont stand my own ground how can I find my own way out of this maze 
 Deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending 
 That everyones expendable and no one has a real friend 
 And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner 
 And everythings done under the sun 
 And you believe at heart everyones a killer 
 Who was born in a house full of pain 
 Who was trained not to spit in the fan 
 Who was told what to do by the man 
 Who was broken by trained personnel 
 Who was fitted with collar and chain 
 Who was given a pat on the back 
 3 
 Who was breaking away from the pack 
 Who was only a stranger at home 
 Who was ground down in the end 
 Who was found dead on the phone 
 Who was dragged down by the stone 
 4We bitch and we fight 
 Diss each other on sight 
 But this thing we do 
 These times you get 
 Rain or shine or stormy weather 
 This thing we do 
 With worldweary grace 
 Weve taken our places 
 We could curse it or nurse it 
 And give it a name 
 Or stay home by the fire 
 Failed by desire 
 Stoking the flames 
 But were here for the ride 
 Its Louder than words 
 This thing that we do 
 Louder than words 
 The way it unfurls 
 Its louder than words 
 The sum of our parts 
 The beat of our hearts 
 Is louder than words 
 The strings bend and slide 
 As the hours fly by 
 An old pair of shoes your favorite blues 
 Gonna tap out the rhythm 
 Lets go with the flow 
 Wherever it goes 
 Were more than alive 
 This thing they call soul 
 Is there with a pulse 
 Louder than wordsThere was a king who ruled the land 
 His majesty was in command 
 With silver eyes the scarlet eagle 
 Showered silver on the people 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 Whydyou have to leave me there 
 Hanging in my infant air waiting 
 You only have to read the lines of 
 Scribbly black and everything shines 
 Across the stream with wooden shoes 
 Bells to tell the king the news 
 A thousand misty riders 
 Climb up higher once upon a time 
 Wondering and dreaming 
 The words had different meaning 
 Yes they did 
 For all the time spent in that room 
 The dolls house darkness old perfume 
 And fairy stories held me high 
 On clouds of sunlight floating by 
 Tell me moreSunlight bright upon my pillow 
 Lighter than an eiderdown 
 Will she let the weeping willow 
 Wind his branches round 
 Julia dream dreamboat queen queen of all my dreams 
 Every night I turn the light out 
 Waiting for the velvet bride 
 Will the scaly armadillo 
 Find me where Im hiding 
 Will the misty master break me 
 Will the key unlock my mind 
 Will the following footsteps catch me 
 Am I really dying 
 Julia dream dreamboat queen queen of all my dreamsTake all your overgrown infants away somewhere 
 And build them a home a little place of their own

 Is everyone in 
 Are you having a nice time 
 Sieg Heil 
 Now the final solution can be appliedYou shout in your sleep 
 Perhaps the price is just too steep 
 Is your conscious at rest 
 If once put to the test 
 You awake with a start 
 To just the beating of your heart 
 Just one man beneath the sky 
 Just two ears just two eyes 
 You set sail across the sea 
 Of long past thoughts and memories 
 Childhoods end your fantasies 
 Merge with harsh realities 
 And then as the sail is hoist 
 You find your eyes are growing moist 
 And all the fears never voiced 
 Say you have to make the final choice 
 Who are you and who am I 
 To say we know the reason why 
 Some are born some men die 
 Beneath one infinite sky 
 Therell be war therell be peace 
 But everything one day will cease 
 All the iron turn to rust 
 All the proud men turn to dust 
 So all things time will mend 
 And so this song will endSpeech has allowed the communication of ideas enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible 
 Mankinds greatest achievements have come about by talking 
 Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future 
 With the technology at our disposal the possibilities are unbounded 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talkingButton your lip and dont let the shield slip 
 Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask 
 And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions 
 You can hide hide hide 
 Behind paranoid eyes 
 You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar 
 Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar 
 Laughing too loud at the rest of the world 
 With the boys in the crowd 
 Behind petrified eyes 
 You believed in their stories of fame fortune and glory 
 Now youre lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age 
 The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high 
 And you hide hide hide 
 Behind brown and mild eyesIt was just before dawn one miserable morning in black fortyfour 
 When the forward commander was told to sit tight when he asked that his men be withdrawn 
 And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while 
 And the Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives 
 And kind old King George sent mother a note when he heard that father was gone 
 It was I recall in the form of a scroll with gold leaf and all 
 And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs hidden away 
 And my eyes still grow damp to remember his majesty signed with his own rubber stamp 
 It was dark all around there was frost in the ground when the tigers broke free 
 And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C 
 They were all left behind most of them dead the rest of them dying 
 And thats how the High Command took my daddy from meSpoken From Gomer Pyle TV show All right Ill take care of them part of the time but theres somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington

 Where the hell are you Simon 
 Machine gun sound followed by plane crashing 
 1Bridges burning brightly 
 Merging with the shadow 
 Flickering between the lines 
 Stolen moments 
 Floating softly on the air 
 Borne on wings of fire 
 And climbing higher 
 Ancient bonds are breaking 
 Moving all and changing sides 
 Dreaming of a new day 
 Cast aside the other way 
 Magic vision stirring 
 Kindled by the burning flames 
 Rise in her eyes 
 The door that stands ajar 
 The walls that once were high 
 Beyond the gilded cage 
 Beyond the reach of ties 
 The moment is at hand 
 She breaks the golden bandHarmlessly passing your time in the grassland away 
 Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air 
 You better watch out 
 There may be dogs about 
 Ive looked over Jordan and I have seen 
 Things are not what they seem 
 What do you get for pretending the dangers not real 
 Meek and obedient you follow the leader 
 Down welltrodden corridors into the valley of steel 
 What a surprise 
 A look of terminal shock in your eyes 
 Now things are really what they seem 
 No this is no bad dream 
 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want 
 He makes me down to lie 
 Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by 
 With bright knives He releaseth my soul 
 He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places 
 He converteth me to lamb cutlets 
 For lo He hath great power and great hunger 
 When cometh the day we lowly ones 
 Through quiet reflection and great dedication 
 Master the art of karate 
 Lo we shall rise up 
 And then well make the buggers eyes water 
 Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
 Wave upon wave of demented avengers 
 March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream 
 Have you heard the news 
 The dogs are dead 
 You better stay home 
 And do as youre told 
 Get out of the road if you want to grow oldDaddys flown across the ocean 
 Leaving just a memory 
 A snap shot in the family album 
 Daddy what else did you leave for me 
 Daddy whatd you leave behind for me 
 All in all it was just a brick in the wall

 Mother do you think theyll like this song 
 Mother do you think theyll try to break my balls

 Mother should I run for President 
 Mother should I trust the government 
 Mother will they put me in the firing line 
 Is it just a waste of time 
 Hush now baby baby dont you cry 
 Mamas gonna make all of your nightmares come true 
 Mamas gonna put all of her fears into you 
 Mamas gonna keep you right here under her wing

 Mother did it need to be so highAye an a bit o mackerel fiddler rack and fear 
 And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow 
 Well I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied 
 And I cried cried cried 
 The fear of fallin down aft taken never back to rise 
 And then cried Mary and I tucked up 
 Wi a Claymore out and about 
 And I run down down the mechyn sty 
 And back on fiery hore that was fallin around the feet 
 Never I cried Never shall ye get me alive 
 Ye rotten hound of the Burnie Brae 
 Well I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust 
 And I fell down before him round his feet 
 Aye a roar he cried Frae the bottom of his heart 
 That I would nay fall but dead dead as a can by a feat deah 
 And the wind cried Mary 
 Thank YouThey disembarked in 45 
 And no one spoke and no one smiled 
 There were too many spaces in the line 
 Gathered at the cenotaph 
 All agreed with hand on heart 
 To sheath the sacrificial knifes

 But now she stands upon Southampton dock 
 With her handkerchief and her summer frock 
 Clings to her wet body in the rain 
 In quiet desperation 
 Knuckles white upon the slippery reins 
 She bravely waves the boys goodbye again 
 Still the dark stain spreads between their shoulder blades 
 A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves 
 When the fight was over we spent what they had made 
 But in the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cutCareful with that axe EugeneBeyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young 
 In a world of magnets and miracles 
 Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary 
 The ringing of the division bell had begun 
 Along the long road and on down the causeway 
 Do they still meet there by the Cut 
 There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps 
 Running before time took our dreams away 
 Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground 
 To a life consumed by slow decay 
 The grass was greener 
 The light was brighter 
 With friends surrounded 
 The nights of wonder 
 Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us 
 To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side 
 Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again 
 Dragged by the force of some inner tide 
 At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
 We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world 
 Encumbered forever by desire and ambition 
 Theres a hunger still unsatisfied 
 Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon 
 Though down this road weve been so many times 
 The taste was sweeter 
 The dawn mist glowing 
 The water flowing 
 The endless river 
 Forever and ever 
 Spoken 
 Hello 
 Yes 
 Is that Charlie 
 Yes 
 Hello Charlie 
 Great 
 1On the turning away 
 From the pale and downtrodden 
 And the words they say which we wont understand 
 Dont accept that whats happening 
 Is just a case of others suffering 
 Or youll find that youre joining in 
 The turning away 
 Its a sin that somehow 
 Light is changing to shadow 
 And casting its shroud over all we have known 
 Unaware how the ranks have grown 
 Driven on by a heart of stone 
 We could find that were all alone 
 In the dream of the proud 
 On the wings of the night 
 As the daytime is stirring 
 Where the speechless unite in a silent accord 
 Using words you will find are strange 
 Mesmerised as they light the flame 
 Feel the new wind of change 
 No more turning away 
 From the weak and the weary 
 No more turning away from the coldness inside 
 Just a world that we all must share 
 Its not enough just to stand and stare 
 Is it only a dream that therell be 
 No more turning awayLeave when I ask you to leave Lucy 
 Please fall away from me Lucy 
 Oh go little girl 
 See that Im so broken up about you Lucy 
 Mean treatin me and done me harm Lucy 
 Been in love with you and your charms Lucy 
 Im in love with you Lucy 
 You got my heart you got my heart oh no 
 You tear me apart you just wont let me go 
 You hold on so tight so tight I just cant breathe 
 Now Lucy leave Lucy 
 Leave when I ask you to leave little girl 
 Please fall away from me little girl 
 Yeah go little girl 
 See that Im so broke up about you Lucy 
 Yeah girlIm so afraid of mistakes that I made 
 Shaking every time that I awake 
 I feel like a cardboard cutout man 
 So build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 And the storyline is kind 
 Ive aged and aged since the first page 
 Ive lived every line that you wrote 
 Take me down take me down 
 From the shelf above your head 
 And build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 I live far enough on the shelf like the rest 
 And the epilogue reads like a sad song 
 Please pick up your camera and use me again 
 YeahHeavy hung the canopy of blue 
 Shade my eyes and I can see you 
 White is the light 
 That shines through the dress that you wore 
 She laid in the shadow of her wave 
 Hazy were the visions overplayed 
 Sunlight on her eyes 
 But moonshine made her blind every time 
 Green is the colour of her kind 
 Quickness of the eye deceives the mind 
 Envy is the bond 
 Between the hopeful and the damnedAll alone or in twos 
 The ones who really love you 
 Walk up and down outside the wall 
 Some hand in hand 
 And some gathered together in bands 
 The bleeding hearts and the artists 
 Make their stand 
 And when theyve given you their all 
 Some stagger and fall after all its not easy 
 Banging your heart against some mad buggers 
 Wall 
 Spoken Isnt this where 
 2A restless eye across a weary room 
 A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin 
 The music played and played as we whirled without end 
 No hint no word her honour to defend 
 I will I will 
 she sighed to my request 
 And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test 
 Then drowned in desire our souls on fire 
 I lead the way to the funeral pyre 
 And without a thought of the consequence 
 I gave in to my decadence 
 One slip and down the hole we fall 
 It seems to take no time at all 
 A momentary lapse of reason 
 That binds a life for life 
 A small regret you wont forget 
 Therell be no sleep in here tonight 
 Was it love or was it the idea of being in love 
 Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove 
 The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown 
 The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone 
 That binds a life to a life 
 You wont regret you will never forget 
 One slip  one slipAnd I am not frightened of dying Any time will do I dont mind 
 Why should I be frightened of dying Theres no reason for it youve gotta go sometime 
 I never said I was frightened of dyingWalk with me Sydney 
 I love to love to love to baby you know 
 Walk with me Sydney 
 I love to love to love to love to love to 
 Walk with me Sydney its a dark night 
 Come on come on hold me tight 
 Well I love to love to love to 
 But I got 
 Flat feet fallen arches 
 Baggy knees and a broken frame 
 Meningitis peritonitis 
 DTs and a washedout brain 
 Roll with me Sydney 
 Roll with me Sydney its a dark night 
 Roll me roll me roll me high 
 DTs and a washedout brainIt would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 Everybody wakes and in the morning 
 Hot tea and cant stop yawning 
 Pass the butter please 
 Have you ever read the Daily Standard 
 Reading all about the plane thats landed 
 Upside down 
 And no one knows what I did today 
 There can be no other way 
 But I would just like to say 
 Everybody cares about the weather 
 And everybody should know better 
 What a waste of time 
 Everybody lives beneath the ceiling 
 Living out a dream that sends them reeling 
 To a distant place 
 But no one knows what I did today 
 To meet sometimeFor millions of years mankind lived just like the animals 
 Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination 
 We learned to talk 
 Theres a silence surrounding me 
 I cant seem to think straight 
 Ill sit in the corner 
 And no one can bother me 
 I think I should speak now Why wont you talk to me 
 I cant seem to speak now You never talk to me 
 My words wont come out right What are you thinking 
 I feel like Im drowning What are you feeling 
 Im feeling weak now Why wont you talk to me 
 But I cant show my weakness You never talk to me 
 I sometimes wonder What are you thinking 
 Where do we go from here What are you feeling 
 It doesnt have to be like this 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking 
 Why wont you talk to me I feel like Im drowning 
 You never talk to me You know I cant breathe now 
 What are you thinking Were going nowhere 
 What are you feeling Were going nowhere 
 Why wont you talk to me 
 You never talk to me 
 What are you thinking 
 Where do we go from here 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talkingDoes anybody here remember Vera Lynn 
 Remember how she said that we would meet again some sunny day 
 Vera Vera what has become of you 
 Does anybody else in here feel the way I doLime and limpid green a second scene 
 A fight between the blue you once knew 
 Floating down the sound resounds 
 Around the icy waters underground 
 Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda 
 And Titania Neptune Titan 
 Stars can frighten 
 Blinding signs flap 
 Flicker flicker flicker blam pow pow 
 Stairway scared Dan Dare whos there 
 Lime and limpid green 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters under 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters undergroundMarshall Dillon Well only about an hour of daylight left We better get started 
 Miss Tyson Is it unsafe to travel at night

 Is there anybody out thereWhen youre one of the few to land on your feet 
 What do you do to make ends meet 
 Teach 
 Make them mad make them sad 
 Make them add two and two 
 Or make them me or make them you 
 Make them do what you want them to 
 Make em lie down and dieI was standing by the Nile 
 When I saw the lady smile 
 I would take her for a while 
 For a while 
 Like tears wept like a child 
 How her golden hair was blowing wild 
 Then she spread her wings to fly 
 For to fly 
 Soaring high above the breezes 
 Going always where she pleases 
 She will make it to the island in the Sun 
 I will follow in her shadow 
 And Ill watch her from my window 
 One day I will catch her eye 
 She is calling from the deep 
 Summoning my soul to endless sleep 
 She is bound to drag me down 
 Drag me downWhen that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Summerevening birds are calling 
 Summer Sunday and a year 
 The sound of music in my ears 
 Distant bells newmown grass 
 Smells so sweet 
 By the river holding hands 
 Roll me up and lay me down 
 And if you see dont make a sound 
 Pick your feet up off the ground 
 And if you hear as the warm night folds 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange 
 Sing to me sing to me 
 When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Childrens laughter in my ears 
 The last sunlight disappears 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange 
 Summerevening birds are callingI have always been here 
 I have always looked out from behind these eyes 
 It feels like more than a lifetime 
 Feels like more than a lifetime 
 Sometimes I get tired of the waiting 
 Sometimes I get tired of being in here 
 Is this the way its always been 
 Could it ever have been different 
 Do you ever get tired of the waiting 
 Do you ever get tired of being in there 
 Dont worry nobody lives forever 
 Nobody lives foreverWe dont need no education 
 We dont need no thought control 
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
 Teacher leave them kids alone 
 Hey teacher leave them kids alone 
 All in all its just another brick in the wall 
 All in all youre just another brick in the wall 
 We dont need no education 
 Teachers leave them kids alone 
 Hey teacher leave us kids alone 
 Wrong Do it again Wrong Do it again

 The Judge 
 The evidence before the court is 
 Incontravertable theres no need for 
 The jury to retire 
 In all my years of judging 
 I have never heard before of 
 Someone more deserving of 
 The full penalty of law 
 The way you made them suffer 
 Your exquisite wife and mother 
 Fills me with the urge to defecate 
 Man in audience 
 Go on Judge shit on him

 Deepest fear

 1I will always be in here 
 I will always look out from behind these eyes 
 Its only a lifetime 
 Its only a lifetimeThere was a boy whose name was Jim 
 His friends they were very good to him 
 They gave him tea and cakes and jam 
 And slices of delicious ham 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 The chief defect of Henry King 
 Was chewing little bits of string 
 At last he swallowed some which tied 
 Itself in ugly knots inside 
 The words have different meanings 
 Yes they did 
 Finding she was left alone 
 Went tiptoe to the telephone 999 
 Summoned the immediate aid 
 Of Londons Noble Fire Brigade 
 Tell me moreDogs of war and men of hate 
 With no cause we dont discriminate 
 Discovery is to be disowned 
 Our currency is flesh and bone 
 Hell opened up and put on sale 
 Gather round and haggle 
 For hard cash we will lie and deceive 
 Even our masters dont know the webs we weave 
 One world its a battleground 
 One world and we will smash it down 
 One world  One world 
 Invisible transfers long distance calls 
 Hollow laughter in marble halls 
 Steps have been taken a silent uproar 
 Has unleashed the dogs of war 
 You cant stop what has begun 
 Signed sealed they deliver oblivion 
 We all have a dark side to say the least 
 And dealing in death is the nature of the beast 
 One world 
 The dogs of war dont negotiate 
 The dogs of war wont capitulate 
 They will take and you will give 
 And you must die so that they may live 
 You can knock at any door 
 But wherever you go you know theyve been there before 
 Well winners can lose and things can get strained 
 But whatever you change you know the dogs remain 
 One world  One worldI am just a new boy 
 A stranger in this town 
 Where are all the good times 
 Whos gonna show this stranger around 
 Ooh I need a dirty woman 
 Ooh I need a dirty girl 
 Will some cold woman in this desert land 
 Make me feel like a real man 
 Take this rock and roll refugee 
 Oooh babe set me free 
 Yes a collect call for Mrs Floyd from Mr Floyd 
 Will you accept the charges from United States 
 Oh he hung up Thats your residence right I wonder why he hung up Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer 
 This is United States calling are we reaching 
 See He keeps hanging up and its a man answeringThe black and green scarecrow as everyone knows 
 Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere he didnt care 
 He stood in a field where barley grows 
 His head did no thinking his arms didnt move 
 Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground 
 The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me 
 But now hes resigned to his fate cause lifes not unkind he doesnt mind 
 He stood in a field where barley growsI was in the kitchen 
 Seamus thats the dog was outside 
 Well I was in the kitchen 
 Seamus my old hound was outside 
 Well you know the sun was sinking slowly 
 And my old hounddog sat right down and criedIn a churchyard by a river 
 Lazing in the haze of midday 
 Laughing in the grasses and the graves 
 Yellow bird you are not long 
 In singing and in flying on 
 In laughing and in leaving 
 Willow weeping in the water 
 Waving to the river daughters 
 Swaying in the ripples and the reeds 
 On a trip to Cirrus Minor 
 Saw a crater in the Sun 
 A thousand miles of moonlight laterWe smile and smile 
 We smile and smile 
 Laughter echoes in your eyes 
 We climb and climb 
 Footfalls softly in the pines 
 We cry and cry 
 Sadness passes in a while 
 We roll and roll 
 Help me roll away the stoneInto the distance a ribbon of black 
 Stretched to the point of no turning back 
 A flight of fancy on a windswept field 
 Standing alone my senses reeled 
 A fatal attraction is holding me fast 
 How can I escape this irresistible grasp 
 Cant keep my eyes from the circling sky 
 Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I 
 Ice is forming on the tips of my wings 
 Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything 
 No navigator to find my way home 
 Unladened empty and turned to stone 
 A soul in tension thats learning to fly 
 Condition grounded but determined to try 
 Cant keep my eyes from the circling skies

 Hello again this is now 1294 
 1294 Its a go 
 Threeeightecho cleared takeoff the winds normal at ten knots 
 Threeeightecho 
 Easy on the brakes Take it easy Its gonna roll this time 
 Just handle the power gradually and it 
 Above the planet on a wing and a prayer 
 My grubby halo a vapour trail in the empty air 
 Across the clouds I see my shadow fly 
 Out of the corner of my watering eye 
 A dream unthreatened by the morning light 
 Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night 
 Theres no sensation to compare with this 
 Suspended animation a state of bliss 
 Cant keep my mind from the circling sky 
 Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit IHey you out there in the cold 
 Getting lonely getting old 
 Can you feel me 
 Hey you standing in the aisles 
 With itchy feet and fading smiles 
 Hey you dont help them to bury the light 
 Dont give in without a fight 
 Hey you out there on your own 
 Sitting naked by the phone 
 Would you touch me 
 Hey you with your ear against the wall 
 Waiting for someone to call out 
 Hey you would you help me to carry the stone 
 Open your heart Im coming home 
 But it was only fantasy 
 The wall was too high 
 As you can see 
 No matter how he tried 
 He could not break free 
 And the worms ate into his brain 
 Hey you out there on the road 
 Always doing what youre told 
 Can you help me 
 Hey you out there beyond the wall 
 Breaking bottles in the hall 
 Hey you dont tell me theres no hope at all 
 Together we stand divided we fall 
 Click of TV being turned on 
 Well only got an hour of daylight left Better get started

 Here is a loud announcement 
 f Remergence 
 Silence in the studioUs and them 
 And after all were only ordinary men 
 Me and you 
 God only knows its not what we would choose to do 
 Forward he cried from the rear 
 And the front rank died 
 And the General sat and the lines on the map 
 Moved from side to side 
 Black and blue 
 And who knows which is which and who is who 
 Up and down 
 And in the end its only round and round and round 
 Havent you heard its a battle of words 
 The poster bearer cried 
 Listen son said the man with the gun 
 Theres room for you inside 
 I mean theyre gonna kill ya So like if you give em a quick sh short sharp shock they dont do it again Dig it I mean he get off light cos I couldve given him a thrashing I only hit him once  Its only a difference of right and wrong innit I mean good manners dont cost nothing do they eh 
 Down and out 
 It cant be helped but theres a lot of it about 
 With without 
 And wholl deny its what the fightings all about 
 Out of the way its a busy day 
 Ive got things on my mind 
 For want of the price of tea and a slice 
 The old man diedWhere were you when I was burned and broken 
 While the days slipped by from my window watching 
 And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless 
 Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me 
 While you were hanging yourself on someone elses words 
 Dying to believe in what you heard 
 I was staring straight into the shining sun 
 Lost in thought and lost in time 
 While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted 
 Outside the rain fell dark and slow 
 While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime 
 I took a heavenly ride through our silence 
 I knew the moment had arrived 
 For killing the past and coming back to life 
 I knew the waiting had begun 
 And headed straight into the shining sunSpoken Look mummy theres an aeroplane up in the sky 
 Ooh 
 Did did did did you see the frightened ones 
 Did did did did you hear the falling bombs 
 Did did did did you ever wonder 
 Why we had to run for shelter 
 When the promise of a brave new world 
 Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky 
 The flames are all longgone 
 But the pain lingers on 
 Goodbye blue sky 
 Spoken The 1115 from Newcastle is now approaching 
 The 1118 arrivalI want to tell you a story 
 About a little man if I can 
 A gnome named Grimble Gromble 
 And little gnomes stay in their homes 
 Eating sleeping drinking their wine 
 He wore a scarlet tunic 
 A bluegreen hood it looked quite good 
 He had a big adventure 
 Amidst the grass fresh air at last 
 Wining dining biding his time 
 And then one day 
 Hooray another way for gnomes to say 
 Ooh my 
 Look at the sky look at the river 
 Isnt it good 
 Winding finding places to go 
 Ooh my ooh myFar far far far away way 
 People heard him say say 
 I will find a way way 
 There will come a day day 
 Something will be done 
 Then at last the mighty ship descending on a point of flame 
 Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall 
 Now now now is the time time time 
 To be be be aware 
 Carters father saw it there 
 And knew the Rhull revealed to him 
 The living soul of Hereward the Wake 
 Oh my something in my eye eye 
 Something in the sky sky 
 Waiting there for me 
 The outer lock rolled slowly back 
 The servicemen were heard to sigh 
 For there revealed in flowing robes was Lucy in the sky 
 Oh oh did you ever 
 No no never ever will they 
 Ill say 
 Summoning his cosmic power 
 And glowing slightly from his toes 
 His psychic emanations flowedEmily tries but misunderstands 
 Shes often inclined to borrow somebodys dreams till tomorrow 
 There is no other day 
 Lets try it another way 
 Youll lose your mind and play 
 Free games for may 
 See Emily play 
 Soon after dark Emily cries 
 Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow 
 Put on a gown that touches the ground 
 Float on a river forever and ever 
 Emily Emily 
 See Emily playDid you know it was all going to go so wrong for you 
 And did you see it was all going to be so right for me 
 Why did we tell you then 
 You were always the golden boy then 
 And that youd never lose that light in your eyes 
 Hey you did you ever realise what youd become 
 And did you see that it wasnt only me you were running from 
 Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway 
 Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes 
 The rain fell slow down on all the roofs of uncertainty 
 I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me 
 And did you know 
 I never thought that youd lose that light in your eyesMarigolds are very much in love 
 But he doesnt mind 
 Picking up sister 
 He makes his way in to the seesaw land 
 All the way up she smiles 
 She goes up while he goes down down 
 Sits on a stick in the river 
 Laughter in his sleep 
 Sisters throwing stones hoping for a hit 
 He doesnt know so then 
 Another time another day 
 A brothers way to leave 
 Another time another day day day day 
 Shes selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon 
 Picking up weeds 
 She hasnt got time to care 
 All can see hes not there 
 She grows up for another man and hes down 
 A brothers way to leaveIts awfully considerate of you to think of me here 
 And Im most obliged to you for making it clear that Im not here 
 And I never knew the moon could be so big 
 And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
 And Im grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
 And brought me here instead dressed in red 
 And Im wondering who could be writing this song 
 I dont care if the sun dont shine 
 And I dont care if nothing is mine 
 And I dont care if Im nervous with you 
 Ill do my loving in the winter 
 And the sea isnt green 
 And I love the Queen 
 And what exactly is a dream 
 And what exactly is a jokeGot a fliptop pack of cigarettes in her pocket 
 Feeling good at the top 
 Shopping in sharp shoes 
 Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool 
 But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores 
 Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores 
 Apples and oranges 
 Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly 
 To meet the people 
 Shes on time again 
 And then 
 I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think 
 What a funny thing to do cause Im feeling very pink 
 I love she 
 She loves me 
 See you 
 Apples and oranges 
 Thought you might like to know 
 Im the lorry driver man 
 Shes on the run 
 Down by the river side 
 Feeding ducks in the afternoon tide quack quack 
 Apples and orangesHey Eugene this is Henry McClean 
 And Ive finished my beautiful flying machine 
 And Im ringing to say 
 That Im leaving and maybe 
 Youd like to fly with me 
 And hide with me baby 
 Isnt it strange how little we change 
 Isnt it sad were insane 
 Playing the games that we know end in tears 
 The games weve been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands and 
 Jumps into his cosmic flyer 
 Pulls his plastic collar higher 
 Light the fuse and stand right back 
 He cried This is my last goodbye 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 And if you survive till two thousand and five 
 I hope youre exceedingly thin 
 For if you are stout you will have to breathe out 
 While the people around you breathe in breathe in breathe in breathe in 
 People pushing on my sides 
 Is something that I hate 
 And so is sitting down to eat 
 With only little capsules on my plate 
 And all weve got to say to you is goodbye 
 Its time to go better run and get your bags its goodbye 
 Nobody cry its goodbye 
 Crash crash crash crash goodbye 
 Crash crash crash crash goodbyeAs you look around this room tonight 
 Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
 Do you want my blood do you want my tears 
 What do you want 
 What do you want from me 
 Should I sing until I cant sing anymore 
 Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
 Youre so hard to please 
 What do you want from me 
 Do you think that I know something you dont know 
 If I dont promise you the answers would you go 
 Should I stand out in the rain 
 Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
 Im not the one you need 
 You can have anything you want 
 You can drift you can dream even walk on water 
 Anything you want 
 You can own everything you see 
 Sell your soul for complete control 
 Is that really what you need 
 You can lose yourself this night 
 See inside there is nothing to hide 
 Turn and face the light 
 What do you want from meOverhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air 
 And deep beneath the rolling waves 
 In labyrinths of coral caves 
 The echo of a distant time 
 Comes willowing across the sand 
 And everything is green and submarine 
 And noone showed us to the land 
 And noone knows the wheres or whys 
 But something stirs and something tries 
 Now starts to climb towards the light 
 Strangers passing in the street 
 By chance two separate glances meet 
 And I am you and what I see is me 
 And do I take you by the hand 
 And lead you through the land 
 And help me understand the best I can 
 And noone calls us to move on 
 And noone forces down our eyes 
 Noone speaks and noone tries 
 Noone flies around the sun 
 Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes 
 Inviting and inciting me to rise 
 And through the window in the wall 
 Come streaming in on sunlight wings 
 A million bright ambassadors of morning 
 And noone sings me lullabies 
 And noone makes me close my eyes 
 So I throw the windows wide 
 And call to you across the skyRemember when you were young 
 You shone like the sun 
 Now theres a look in your eyes 
 Like black holes in the sky 
 You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom 
 Blown on the steel breeze 
 Come on you target for faraway laughter 
 Come on you stranger you legend you martyr and shine 
 You reached for the secret too soon 
 You cried for the moon 
 Threatened by shadows at night 
 And exposed in the light 
 Well you wore out your welcome with random precision 
 Rode on the steel breeze 
 Come on you raver you seer of visions 
 Come on you painter you piper you prisoner and shineOh my girl sitting in the sun 
 Go buy candy and a currant bun 
 I like to see you run 
 Lay back 
 Ooh dont talk to me 
 Please just walk with me 
 Please you know Im feeling frail 
 Its true sun shining very bright 
 Its you who Im gonna love tonight 
 Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon 
 Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon 
 Ooh dont touch me child 
 Please you know you drive me wild 
 Drive me wild 
 Dont try another cat 
 Dont go where other you must know 
 Im very very very frail 
 Oh my girl sitting in the sun 
 And flyLittle by little the night turns around 
 Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn 
 Lotuses lean on each other in yearning 
 Under the eaves the swallow is resting 
 Set the controls for the heart of the Sun 
 Over the mountain watching the watcher 
 Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine 
 One inch of love is one inch of shadow 
 Love is the shadow that ripens the wine 
 The heart of the Sun the heart of the Sun 
 Witness the man who raves at the wall 
 Making the shape of his question to Heaven 
 Whether the sun will fall in the evening 
 Will he remember the lesson of giving 
 The heart of the Sun the heart of the SunAll that you touch 
 And all that you see 
 All that you taste 
 All you feel 
 And all that you love 
 And all that you hate 
 All you distrust 
 All you save 
 And all that you give 
 And all that you deal 
 And all that you buy 
 Beg borrow or steal 
 And all you create 
 And all you destroy 
 And all that you do 
 And all that you say 
 And all that you eat 
 And everyone you meet everyone you meet 
 And all that you slight 
 And everyone you fight 
 And all that is now 
 And all that is gone 
 And all thats to come 
 And everything under the sun is in tune 
 But the sun is eclipsed by the moon 
 There is no dark side in the moon really Matter of fact its all darkYou know that I care what happens to you 
 And I know that you care for me too 
 So I dont feel alone 
 Or the weight of the stone 
 Now that Ive found somewhere safe 
 To bury my bone 
 And any fool knows a dog needs a home 
 A shelter from pigs on the wingWell Im a king bee 
 Buzzing around your hive 
 Yes Im a king bee child 
 I can make good honey 
 Let me come inside 
 Im young and able 
 To buzz all night long 
 You know Im young and able 
 When you hear me buzz little girl 
 You know theres some stinging going on 
 Well buzz 
 Oh sting 
 Yeah 
 Well Im a king bee 
 Can buzz all night long 
 Yes Im a king bee 
 Well I can buzz better baby 
 When your man is goneIf I were a swan Id be gone 
 If I were a train Id be late 
 And if I were a good man 
 Id talk with you more often than I do 
 If I were asleep I could dream 
 If I were afraid I could hide 
 If I go insane 
 Please dont put your wires in my brain 
 If I were the moon Id be cool 
 If I were the rule I would bend 
 If I were a good man 
 Id understand the spaces between friends 
 If I were alone I would cry 
 And if I were with you Id be home and dry 
 And if I go insane 
 Will you still let me join in with the game 
 If I were a swan Id be gone 
 If I were a train Id be late again 
 Id talk with you more often than I doBig man pig man 
 Ha ha charade you are 
 You wellheeled big wheel 
 And when your hand is on your heart 
 Youre nearly a good laugh 
 Almost a joker 
 With your head down in the pig bin 
 Saying Keep on digging 
 Pig stain on your fat chin 
 What do you hope to find 
 Down in the pig mine 
 Youre nearly a laugh 
 But youre really a cry 
 Bus stop rat bag 
 You fucked up old hag 
 You radiate cold shafts of broken glass 
 Almost worth a quick grin 
 You like the feel of steel 
 Youre hot stuff with a hat pin 
 And good fun with a hand gun 
 Hey you 
 Whitehouse 
 You houseproud town mouse 
 Youre trying to keep our feelings off the street 
 Youre nearly a real treat 
 All tight lips and cold feet 
 And do you feel abused 
 You gotta stem the evil tide 
 And keep it all on the inside 
 Mary youre nearly a treat 
 But youre really a crywe came in 
 So ya thought ya might like to go to the show 
 Tell me is something eluding you sunshine 
 Is this not what you expected to see 
 If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes 
 Youll just have to claw your way through this disguise 
 Lights 
 Roll the sound effects 
 Action 
 Drop it 
 Drop it on em 
 2As I reach for a peach 
 Slide a line down behind a sofa in San Tropez 
 Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand 
 Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan 
 Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness 
 Scratched by the sand that fell from my love 
 Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling 
 If youre alone Ill come hohohome 
 Backward and homebound the pigeon the dove 
 Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane 
 Born in a home with no silver spoon 
 Im drinking champagne like a good tycoon 
 Sooner than wait for a break in the weather 
 Ill gather my farflung thoughts together 
 Speeding away on a wind to a new day 
 And Ill pause for a while by a country stile 
 And listen to the things they say 
 Digging for gold in a hole in my hand 
 Open the book take a look at the way things stand 
 And youre leading me down to the place by the sea 
 I hear your soft voice calling to me 
 Making a date for later by phone 
 And if youre alone Ill come hohohomeOooh Ma Oooh Pa 
 Must the show go on 
 Oooh Pa take me home take me home take me home 
 Oooh Ma let me go let me go let me go 
 There must be some mistake 
 I didnt mean to let them 
 Take away my soul 
 Am I too old Is it too late 
 Oooh Ma Oooh Pa 
 Where has the feeling gone 
 Will I remember the songs 
 The show must go onAll movement is accomplished in six stages

 Going and coming without error 
 Action brings good fortune

 The time is with the month of winter solstice 
 When the change is due to come 
 Thunder in the Earth the course of heaven

 We certainly have an unspoken understanding

 Well we shout and argue and fight and work it on out 
 Nick 
 The sum is greater than the partsStop 
 I wanna go home 
 Take off this uniform 
 And leave the show 
 And Im waiting in this cell 
 Because I have to know 
 Have I been guilty all this timeRemember me 
 Ive been here before 
 Remember me 
 Cant you see 
 Im gonna stick around some more 
 I want some love from you 
 Dont go away now 
 Ive got something to give to you 
 Ill try to be 
 As good as gold to you 
 Try to be 
 But dont blame me girl 
 If Im far from cold to you 
 Come and stick around some more 
 YeahGoodbye cruel world 
 Im leaving you today 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye all you people 
 Theres nothing you can say 
 To make me change 
 My mind 
 GoodbyeOn the day the wall came down 
 They threw the locks onto the ground 
 And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived 
 On the day the wall came down 
 The Ship of Fools had finally run aground 
 Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight 
 I dreamed you had left my side 
 No warmth not even pride remained 
 And even though you needed me 
 It was clear that I could not do a thing for you 
 Now life devalues day by day 
 As friends and neighbours turn away 
 And theres a change that even with regret cannot be undone 
 Now frontiers shift like desert sands 
 While nations wash their bloodied hands 
 Of loyalty of history in shades of grey 
 I woke to the sound of drums 
 The music played the morning sun streamed in 
 I turned and I looked at you 
 And all but the bitter residue slipped away slipped awayI was spending my time in the doldrums 
 I was caught in a cauldron of hate 
 I felt persecuted and paralysed 
 I thought that everything else would just wait 
 While you are wasting your time on your enemies 
 Engulfed in a fever of spite 
 Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades 
 Like shadows into the night 
 To martyr yourself to caution 
 Is not going to help at all 
 Cause therell be no safety in numbers 
 When the right one walks out of the door 
 Can you see your days blighted by darkness 
 Is it true you beat your fists on the floor 
 Stuck in a world of isolation 
 While the ivy grows over the door 
 So I open my door to my enemies 
 And I ask could we wipe the slate clean 
 But they tell me to please go fuck myself 
 You know you just cant winSpoken Oh my God What a fabulous room Are all these your guitars 
 Film in background Im sorry sir I didnt mean to startle you 
 This place is bigger than our apartment 
 Film Let me know when youre entering a room 
 Yes sir 
 Um Can I get a drink of water 
 Film I was wondering about  
 You want some huh 
 Film Yes 
 Oh wow look at this tub Do you wanna take a bath 
 Film Ill have to find out from Mrs Bancroft what time she wants to meet us for her main  
 What are you watching 
 Film If youll just let me know as soon as you can  Mrs Bancroft Mrs Bancroft  
 Hello 
 Film I dont understand  
 Are you feeling okay 
 1 
 Day after day love turns grey 
 Like the skin of a dying man 
 And night after night we pretend its all right 
 2 
 But I have grown older and 
 You have grown colder and 
 Nothing is very much fun anymore 
 And I can feel one of my turns coming on 
 I feel cold as a razor blade 
 Tight as a tourniquet 
 Dry as a funeral drum 
 Run to the bedroom in the suitcase on the left 
 Youll find my favourite axe 
 Dont look so frightened 
 This is just a passing phase 
 One of my bad days 
 3 
 Would you like to watch TV 
 Or get between the sheets 
 Or contemplate the silent freeway 
 Would you like something to eat 
 Would you like to learn to fly Would you

 Would you like to see me try Ooh no

 Would you like to call the cops 
 Do you think its time I stopped 
 Why are you running awayInstrumental 
 Rise and Shine 
 Oh um flakes oh 
 Then uh I dont know scrambled eggs bacon sausages tomatoes 
 Toast coffee

 Any cereal I like all cereal 
 Sunny Side Up 
 Breakfast in Los Angeles

 No reply

 Do you know Elton John

 Getting ready for a gig

 He does that electrical stuff 
 I cant follow that 
 Morning Glory 
 Scrambled eggs bacon sausages tomatoes 
 I dont like coffee 
 What a day 
 What 
 My heads a blankThe sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land 
 Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky 
 A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers 
 But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking 
 Hes haunted by the memory of a lost paradise 
 In his youth or a dream he cant be precise 
 Hes chained forever to a world thats departed 
 Its not enough its not enough 
 His blood has frozen and curdled with fright 
 His knees have trembled and given way in the night 
 His hand has weakened at the moment of truth 
 His step has faltered 
 One world one soul 
 Time pass the river rolls 
 Its not enough Its not enough 
 And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication 
 And silent replies that swirl invitation 
 Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea 
 A grim intimation of what is to be 
 Theres an unceasing wind that blows through this night 
 And theres dust in my eyes that blinds my sight 
 And silence that speaks so much louder than words 
 Of promises brokenTicking away the moments that make up a dull day 
 Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way 
 Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
 Waiting for someone or something to show you the way 
 Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain 
 And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today 
 And then one day you find ten years have got behind you 
 No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun 
 And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking 
 Racing around to come up behind you again 
 The sun is the same in a relative way but youre older 
 Shorter of breath and one day closer to death 
 Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time 
 Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
 Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
 The time is gone the song is over thought Id something more to say 
 Breathe Reprise 
 Home home again 
 I like to be here when I can 
 When I come home cold and tired 
 1 
 Its good to warm my bones beside the fire 
 Far away across the field 
 The tolling of the iron bell 
 Calls the faithful to their knees 
 To hear the softly spoken magic spellFrom morning to night I stayed out of sight 
 Didnt recognise Id become 
 No more than alive Id barely survive 
 In a word overrun 
 Wont hear a sound Hes curled into the corner 
 From my mouth But still the screen is flickering 
 Ive spent too long With an endless stream of garbage to 
 On the inside out curse the place 
 My skin is cold In a sea of random images 
 To the human touch The selfdestructing animal 
 This bleeding hearts Waiting for the waves to break 
 Not beating much 
 I murmured a vow of silence and now 
 I dont even hear when I think aloud 
 Extinguished by light I turn on the night 
 Wear its darkness with an empty smile 
 Im creeping back to life 
 My nervous system all awry 
 Im wearing the inside out 
 Look at him now 
 Hes paler somehow 
 But hes coming round 
 Hes starting to choke 
 Its been so long since he spoke 
 Well he can have the words right from my mouth 
 And with these words I can see 
 Clear through the clouds that covered me 
 Just give it time then speak my name 
 Now we can hear ourselves again 
 Im holding out Hes standing on the threshold 
 For the day Caught in fiery anger 
 When all the clouds And hurled into the furnace hell 
 Have blown away curse the place 
 Im with you now Hes torn in all directions 
 Can speak your name And still the screen is flickering 
 Now we can hear Waiting for the flames to break 
 Ourselves againspoken 
 Pass the tequila Manuel 
 Listen gringo 
 Laugh at my lisp and I kill you 
 I think 
 Ah this Spanish music 
 It sets my soul on fire 
 Lovely senorita 
 Your eyes are like stars 
 Your teeth are like pearls 
 Your ruby lipsCorporal Clegg had a wooden leg 
 He won it in the war 
 In nineteen forty four 
 Corporal Clegg had a medal too 
 In orange red and blue 
 He found it in the zoo 
 Dear oh dear oh are they really sad for me 
 Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me 
 Missus Clegg you must be proud of him 
 Missus Clegg another drop of gin 
 Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain 
 Hes never been the same 
 No one is to blame 
 Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream 
 From her Majesty the Queen 
 His boots were very clean 
 Corporal Clegg 
 Johnny 
 Johnny is on guard 
 All right men  in you go 
 Left right left right 
 Im right behind you 
 What are you speaking of About that leg of yours 
 Youll excuse me from now on what of it 
 Ha We got him 
 Johnny Cleggs dead 
 Corporal CleggOiGet your filthy hands off my desert 
 What e say 
 Brezhnev took Afghanistan 
 And Begin took Beirut 
 Galtieri took the Union Jack 
 And Maggie over lunch one day 
 Took a cruiser with all hands 
 Apparently to make him give it backHeaven sent the promised land 
 Looks alright from where I stand 
 Cause Im the man on the outside looking in 
 Waiting on the first step 
 Show me where the key is kept 
 Point me down the right line because its time 
 To let me in from the cold 
 Turn my lead into gold 
 Cause theres a chill wind blowing in my soul 
 And I think Im growing old 
 Flash the readies 
 Wots uh the deal 
 Got to make it to the next meal 
 Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel 
 Mile after mile stone after stone 
 You turn to speak but youre alone 
 Million miles from home youre on your own 
 So let me in from the cold 
 Fire bright by candle light 
 With her by my side 
 And if she prefers we need never stir again 
 Someone sent the promised land 
 And I grabbed it with both hands 
 Now Im the man on the inside looking out 
 Hear me shout Come on in 
 Whats the news and where you been 
 Cause theres no wind left in my soul 
 And Ive grown oldThe path you tread is narrow 
 And the drop is sheer and very high 
 The ravens all are watching 
 From a vantage point nearby 
 Apprehension creeping 
 Like a tubetrain up your spine 
 Will the tightrope reach the end 
 Will the final couplet rhyme 
 And its high time Cymbaline 
 Its high time Cymbaline 
 Please wake me 
 A butterfly with broken wings 
 Is falling by your side 
 The ravens all are closing in 
 Theres nowhere you can hide 
 Your manager and agent 
 Are both busy on the phone 
 Selling coloured photographs 
 To magazines back home 
 The lines converging where you stand 
 They must have moved the picture plane 
 The leaves are heavy around your feet 
 You hear the thunder of the train 
 Suddenly it strikes you 
 That theyre moving into range 
 And Doctor Strange 
 Is always changing size 
 Please wake meThrough the fisheyed lens of tear stained eyes 
 I can barely define the shape of this moment in time 
 And far from flying high in clear blue skies 
 Im spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide 
 If you negotiate the minefield in the drive 
 And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes 
 And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall 
 Dial the combination open the priesthole 
 And if Im in Ill tell you whats behind 
 the wall 
 gunshot which obscures the wall 
 Theres a kid who had a big hallucination 
 Making love to girls in magazines 
 He wonders if youre sleeping with your new found faith 
 Could anybody love him or is it just a crazy dream 
 And if I show you my dark side 
 Will you still hold me tonight 
 And if I open my heart to you 
 And show you my weak side 
 What would you do 
 Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone 
 Would you take the children away and leave me alone 
 And smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone 
 Would you send me packing or would you take me home 
 Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings 
 Thought I oughta tear the curtain down 
 I held the blade in trembling hands 
 Prepared to make it but 
 Just then the phone rang 
 I never had the nerve to make the final cut 
 Hello Listen I think Ive got it Okay listen Its a Ha ha haLast night I had too much to drink 
 Sitting in a club with so many fools 
 Playing to rules 
 Trying to impress but feeling rather empty 
 I had another drink 
 Drink  a  drink  a  drink  a  drink 
 What a way to spend that evening 
 They all turn up with their friends 
 Playing the game 
 Theyre in the scene always should have been 
 Far away 
 Away  away  away  away  away 
 Getting up I feel as if Im remembering this scene before 
 I open the door to an empty room 
 Then I forget 
 Pretend the phone rings and someone speaks 
 She would very much like to go out to a show 
 So what can I do  I cant think of what to say 
 She sees through anyway 
 Out of the front door I go 
 Traffics moving rather slow 
 Arriving late there she waits 
 Looking very angry as cross as she can be 
 Be  a  be  a  be  a  be  a  be 
 Then I forgetIn my rear view mirror the sun is going down 
 Sinking behind bridges in the road 
 I think of all the good things that we have left undone 
 And I suffer premonitions 
 Confirm suspicions 
 Of the holocaust to come 
 The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in 
 Gives way and suddenly its day again 
 The sun is in the east even though the day is done 
 Two suns in the sunset 
 Could be the human race is run 
 Like the moment when the brakes lock 
 And you slide towards the big truck 
 Oh no 
 You stretch the frozen moments with your fear 
 And youll never hear their voices 
 Daddy Daddy 
 And youll never see their faces 
 You have no recourse to the law anymore 
 And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate 
 Leaving only charcoal to defend 
 Finally I understand the feelings of the few 
 Ashes and diamonds 
 Foe and friend 
 We were all equal in the end 
 and now the weather Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east  with an expected high of 4000 degrees CelsiusSo so you think you can tell 
 Heaven from Hell blue skies from pain 
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail 
 A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell 
 Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts 
 Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze 
 Cold comfort for change Did you exchange 
 A walkon part in the war for a lead role in a cage 
 How I wish how I wish you were here 
 Were just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year 
 Running over the same old ground what have we found 
 The same old fears 
 Wish you were hereYou say the hills too steep to climb 
 Chiding 
 You say youd like to see me try 
 Climbing 
 You pick the place and Ill choose the time 
 And Ill climb the hill in my own way 
 Just wait a while for the right day 
 And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds 
 I look down hear the sound of the things you said today 
 Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd 
 Smiling 
 Merciless the magistrate turns round 
 Frowning 
 And whos the fool who wears the crown 
 No doubt in your own way 
 And every day is the right day 
 And as you rise above the fear lines in his brow 
 You look down hear the sound of the faces in the crowd 
 Walk on walk on with hope in your heart 
 And youll never walk alone 
 Youll never walk alone 
 Walk on walk on with hope in your heart 
 Liverpool 
 Liverpooldont forget your hand luggage have your passports ready Then follow the green line to customs and then to emigration 
 BA twoonefive to Rome 
 May I have your attention please Here is an announcement for BOAC passengers on BA twoonefive to Romedont forget your hand luggage have your passports ready 
 Live for today gone tomorrow thats me HahahaaaaaaWould you like to say something before you leave 
 Perhaps youd care to state exactly how you feel 
 We say goodbye before we said hello 
 I hardly even like you I shouldnt care at all 
 We met just six hours ago the music was too loud 
 From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year 
 And I would like to know 
 How do you feel how do you feel 
 Not a single word was said the night still hid our fears 
 Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need 
 I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninetyfive 
 My friends are lying in the sun I wish that I was there 
 Tomorrow brings another town another girl like you 
 Have you time before you leave to greet another man 
 Just you let me know 
 Goodbye to you 
 Charlotte Pringles due 
 Ive had enough for one daya group of business men announced plans to build a nuclear fallout shelter at Peterborough in Cambridgeshire 
 three high court judges have cleared the way to 
 it was announced today that the replacement for the Atlantic Conveyor the container ship lost in Falklands conflict 
 would be built in Japan A spokesman for 
 moving in They say the third world countries like Bolivia which produce the drug are suffering from rising violence 
 Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified 
 Was it for this that Daddy died 
 Was it you Was it me 
 Did I watch too much TV 
 Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes 
 If it wasnt for the Nips 
 Being so good at building ships 
 The yards would still be open on the Clyde 
 And it cant be much fun for them 
 Beneath the rising sun 
 With all their kids committing suicide 
 What have we done Maggie what have we done 
 What have we done to England 
 Should we shout Should we scream 
 What happened to the post war dream 
 Oh Maggie Maggie what have we doneIve got a bike you can ride it if you like 
 Its got a basket a bell that rings 
 And things to make it look good 
 Id give it to you if I could but I borrowed it 
 Youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 Ill give you anything everything if you want things 
 Ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke 
 Theres a tear up the front its red and black 
 Ive had it for months 
 If you think it could look good then I guess it should 
 I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house 
 I dont know why I call him Gerald 
 Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse 
 Ive got a clan of gingerbread men 
 Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men 
 Take a couple if you wish theyre on the dish 
 I know a room of musical tunes 
 Some rhyme some ching most of them are clockwork 
 Lets go into the other room and make them workHello 
 Is there anybody in there 
 Just nod if you can hear me 
 Is there anyone home 
 Come on now 
 I hear youre feeling down 
 I can ease your pain 
 And get you on your feet again 
 Relax 
 Ill need some information first 
 Just the basic facts 
 Can you show me where it hurts 
 There is no pain you are receding 
 A distant ship smoke on the horizon 
 You are only coming through in waves 
 Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying 
 When I was a child I had a fever 
 My hands felt just like two balloons 
 Now Ive got that feeling once again 
 I cant explain you would not understand 
 This is not how I am 
 I have become comfortably numb 
 OK 
 Just a little pinprick 
 Therell be no more aaaaaaaah 
 But you may feel a little sick 
 Can you stand up 
 I do believe its working good 
 Thatll keep you going through the show 
 Come on its time to go 
 When I was a child 
 I caught a fleeting glimpse 
 Out of the corner of my eye 
 I turned to look but it was gone 
 I cannot put my finger on it now 
 The child is grown 
 The dream is gone 
 I have become comfortably numbStay 
 And help me to end the day 
 And if you dont mind 
 Well break a bottle of wine 
 Stick around 
 And maybe well put one down 
 Cause I wanna find 
 What lies behind those eyes 
 Midnight blue burning gold 
 A yellow moon is growing cold 
 I rise 
 Looking through my morning eyes 
 Surprised 
 To find you by my side 
 Rack my brain 
 And try to remember your name 
 To find 
 The words to tell you goodbye 
 Morning dues new born day 
 Midnight blue turned to grey 
 A yellow moon is growing coldSo ya thought ya might like to go to the show 
 To feel the warm thrill of confusion that space cadet glow 
 Ive got some bad news for you sunshine 
 Pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel 
 And they sent us along as a surrogate band 
 And were going to find out where you fans really stand 
 Are there any queers in the theater tonight 
 Get em up against the wall Against the wall 
 Theres one in the spotlight he dont look right to me 
 Get him up against the wall Against the wall 
 That one looks Jewish and that ones a coon 
 Who let all of this riffraff into the room 
 Theres one smoking a joint and another with spots 
 If I had my way Id have all of you shotOne two free four 
 The memories of a man in his old age 
 Are the deeds of a man in his prime 
 You shuffle in the gloom of the sick room 
 And talk to yourself as you die 
 Life is a short warm moment 
 And death is a long cold rest 
 You get your chance to try 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 Eighty years with luck or even less 
 So all aboard for the American tour 
 And maybe youll make it to the top 
 But mind how you go 
 And I can tell you cos I know 
 You may find it hard to get off 
 But you are the angel of death 
 And I am the dead mans son 
 He was buried like a mole in a foxhole 
 And everyones still in the run 
 And who is the master of foxhounds 
 And who says the hunt has begun 
 And who calls the tune in the courtroom 
 And who beats the funeral drum 
 And talk to yourself as you dieThe lunatic is on the grass 
 The lunatic is on the grass 
 Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs 
 Got to keep the loonies on the path 
 The lunatic is in the hall 
 The lunatics are in my hall 
 The paper holds their folded faces to the floor 
 And every day the paper boy brings more 
 And if the dam breaks open many years too soon 
 And if there is no room upon the hill 
 And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too 
 Ill see you on the dark side of the moon 
 The lunatic is in my head 
 You raise the blade you make the change 
 You rearrange me till Im sane 
 You lock the door 
 And throw away the key 
 Theres someone in my head but its not me 
 And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear 
 You shout and no one seems to hear 
 And if the band youre in starts playing different tunes 
 I cant think of anything to say except Hahahaha Hahahaha 
 I think its marvelous 
 HahahaFollowing the path as it leads towards 
 The darkness in the North 
 Weary strangers faces show their sympathy 
 Theyve seen that hope before 
 But if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
 Before you the night is beckoning 
 And you know you cant delay 
 You hear the night birds calling you 
 But you cant catch the words they say 
 Close your ears and eyes be on your way 
 Mist is swirling creatures crawling 
 Hear the roar get louder in your ears 
 You know the folly was your own 
 But the force behind cant conquer all your fears 
 And if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Pull your thoughts back many years 
 To the time when there was life with every morning 
 Perhaps a day will come 
 When the light will be as clear as on that morning 
 Close your ears and eyes be on your wayBreathe breathe in the air 
 Dont be afraid to care 
 Leave but dont leave me 
 Look around choose your own ground 
 For long you live and high you fly 
 And smiles youll give and tears youll cry 
 And all you touch and all you see 
 Is all your life will ever be 
 Run rabbit run 
 Dig that hole forget the sun 
 And when at last the work is done 
 Dont sit down its time to dig another one 
 But only if you ride the tide 
 And balanced on the biggest wave 
 You race towards an early graveRemember a day before today 
 A day when you were young 
 Free to play along with time 
 Evening never comes 
 Sing a song that cant be sung 
 Without the mornings kiss 
 Queen you shall be if you wish 
 Look for your King 
 Why cant we play today 
 Why cant we stay that way 
 Climb your favourite apple tree 
 Try to catch the sun 
 Hide from your little brothers gun 
 Dream yourself away 
 Why cant we reach the sun 
 Why cant we blow the years away 
 Blow away 
 Remember 
 RememberListen all you girlies 
 Even though I havent met you 
 Gonna catch you soon 
 In my butterfly net 
 Youd better watch out 
 Sometimes when I watch you 
 I stretch out my hand to touch you 
 Cause it drives my me wild 
 To see you flutter by 
 You butterfly 
 I wont squeeze you dead 
 Aiming through your head 
 I just want your love 
 I wont cry your name 
 In Latin in the rain 
 Cause raining its a shame 
 Listen all you girlies 
 Youd better watch outOne sound one single sound 
 One kiss one single kiss 
 A face outside the window pane 
 However did it come to this 
 A man who ran a child who cried 
 A girl who heard a voice that lied 
 The sun that burned a fiery red 
 The vision of an empty bed 
 The use of force he was so tough 
 Shell soon submit shes had enough 
 The march of fate the broken will 
 Someone is lying very still 
 He has laughed and he has cried 
 He has fought and he has died 
 Hes just the same as all the rest 
 Hes not the worst and hes not the best 
 And still this ceaseless murmuring 
 The babbling that I brook 
 The seas of faces eyes upraised 
 The empty screen the vacant look 
 A man in black on a snow white horse 
 A pointless life has run its course 
 The red rimmed eyes the tears still run 
 As he fades into the setting sunNobody knows where you are 
 How near or how far 
 Shine on you crazy diamond 
 Pile on many more layers 
 And Ill be joining you there 
 And well bask in the shadow of yesterdays triumph 
 Sail on the steel breeze 
 Come on you boy child you winner and loser 
 Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shineMamma loves her baby 
 And daddy loves you too 
 And the sea may look warm to you babe 
 And the sky may look blue 
 Ooooh babe 
 Ooooh baby blue 
 Ooooh ooooh babe 
 If you should go skating 
 On the thin ice of modern life 
 Dragging behind you the silent reproach 
 Of a million tear stained eyes 
 Dont be surprised when a crack in the ice 
 Appears under your feet 
 You slip out of your depth and out of your mind 
 With your fear flowing out behind you 
 As you claw the thin iceIf you didnt care what happened to me 
 And I didnt care for you 
 We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain 
 Occasionally glancing up through the rain 
 Wondering which of the buggers to blame 
 And watching for pigs on the wingBo Diddley was a private eye 
 Hand was fast and his IQ high 
 DA said Double O you wont last 
 Slow down boy you living too fast 
 Well Double O had a Cadillac 
 Machine guns and a bulletproof back 
 Engine taken from a 707 
 Sounds like a sure way to get into heaven 
 In his pocket 5 pounds of lead 
 Keep Bo Diddley from getting dead 
 Another thing helped Bo keeping alive 
 Was a snubnosed Smith And Wesson Colt 45 
 Well Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon 
 Martinis dry and you better serve them 
 Martini so dry the shaker burst 
 Bo keeled on his side and died of thirstEins zwei drei alle 
 Ooh you cannot reach me now 
 Ooh no matter how you try 
 Goodbye cruel world its over 
 Walk on by 
 Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall 
 Waiting for the worms to come Worms to come 
 In perfect isolation here behind my wall 
 Will the Audience convene at one fifteen outside Brixton town hall where we will be going 
 Waiting to cut out the deadwood 
 Waiting to clean up the city 
 Waiting to follow the worms 
 Waiting to put on a black shirt 
 Waiting to weed out the weaklings 
 Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors 
 Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain 
 Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens 
 Waiting for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews 
 Would you like to see Britannia Rule again my friend 
 All you have to do is follow the worms 
 Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again my friend 
 All you need to do is follow the worms

 Lying on an eiderdown yippee 
 You cant see me but I can you 
 Lazing in the foggy dew 
 Sitting on a unicorn no fear 
 You cant hear me but I can you 
 Watching buttercups cup the light 
 Sleeping on a dandelion too much 
 I wont touch you but then I might 
 Screaming through the starlit skies 
 Traveling by telephone 
 Hey ho here we go 
 Ever so high 
 Alone in the clouds all blue 
 You cant see me but I can youMoney get away

 Spoken Sound of many TVs coming on all on different channels 
 The Bulls are already out there 
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh 
 This room will be a bakery Thought youd like to know 
 3They flutter behind you your possible pasts 
 Some brighteyed and crazy some frightened and lost 
 A warning to anyone still in command 
 Ranks fire 
 Of their possible future to take care 
 In derelict sidings the poppies entwine 
 With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time 
 Do you remember me How we used to be 
 Do you think we should be closer 
 How are you tonight 
 She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile 
 Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign 
 Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs 
 For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs 
 Stepping up boldly one put out his hand 
 He said I was just a child then now Im only a man 
 By the cold and religious we were taken in hand 
 Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad 
 Strung out behind us the banners and flags 
 Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags 
 Do you think we should be closerIcy wind of night be gone 
 This is not your domain 
 In the sky a bird was heard to cry 
 Misty morning whisperings 
 And gentle stirring sounds 
 Belied a deathly silence 
 That lay all around 
 Hear the lark and harken 
 To the barking of the dog fox 
 Gone to ground 
 See the splashing 
 Of the kingfisher flashing to the water 
 And a river of green is sliding 
 Unseen beneath the trees 
 Laughing as it passes 
 Through the endless summer 
 Making for the sea 
 In the lazy water meadow 
 I lay me down 
 All around me golden sunflakes 
 Settle on the ground 
 Basking in the sunshine 
 Of a bygone afternoon 
 Bringing sounds of yesterday 
 Into this city room 
 Covering the ground 
 Into my city room 
 A river of green is sliding 
 Making for the seaSpoken chanted Pink Floyd Pink Floyd 
 Run run run run 
 You better make your face up in your favourite disguise 
 With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes 
 With your empty smile and your hungry heart 
 Feel the bile rising from your guilty past 
 With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters 
 And the hammers batter down the door 
 You better run 
 You better run all day and run all night 
 And keep your dirty feelings deep inside 
 And if youre taking your girlfriend out tonight 
 You better park the car well out of sight 
 Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks 
 Theyre gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box 
 Spoken Hey open up HaHaHaHaHaaaaaaaaaa 
 sound of car skidding followed by loud scream 
 chanting Hammer Hammer 
 1Floating down through the clouds 
 Memories come rushing up to meet me now 
 But in the space between the heavens and the corner of some foreign field 
 I had a dream I had a dream 
 Goodbye Max goodbye Ma 
 After the service when youre walking slowly to the car 
 And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air 
 You hear the tolling bell 
 And touch the silk in your lapel 
 And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band 
 You take her frail hand 
 And hold on to the dream 
 A place to stay 
 Oi A real one  
 Enough to eat 
 Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street 
 Where you can speak out loud 
 About your doubts and fears 
 And whats more no one ever disappears 
 You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door 
 You can relax on both sides of the tracks 
 And maniacs dont blow holes in bandsmen by remote control 
 And everyone has recourse to the law 
 And no one kills the children anymore 
 Night after night 
 Going round and round my brain 
 His dream is driving me insane 
 In the corner of some foreign field 
 The gunner sleeps tonight 
 Whats done is done 
 We cannot just write off his final scene 
 Take heed of the dream 
 Take heedDoctor doctor Im in bed 
 Doctor doctor aching head 
 Doctor doctor gold is lead 
 Doctor doctor choke on bread 
 Doctor doctor underfed 
 Doctor doctor Jesus bled 
 Doctor doctor pain is red 
 Doctor doctor dark doom 
 Gruel ghoul greasy spoon 
 Used spool June gloom 
 Why do you go 
 And now 
 Music seems to help the pain 
 Seems to motivate the brain 
 Doctor kindly tell your wife 
 That Im alive flowers thrive 
 Realise realise 
 RealiseCome in here dear boy have a cigar youre gonna go far 
 Youre gonna fly high youre never gonna die 
 Youre gonna make it if you try theyre gonna love you 
 Well Ive always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincerely 
 The band is just fantastic that is really what I think 
 Oh by the way  which ones Pink 
 And did we tell you the name of the game boy 
 We call it Riding the Gravy Train 
 Were just knocked out we heard about the sell out 
 You gotta get an album out you owe it to the people 
 Were so happy we can hardly count 
 Everybody else is just green have you seen the chart 
 Its a hell of a start it could be made into a monster 
 If we all pull together as a team 
 Disciplinary it remains mercifully 
 Yes and then Derek this star nonsense 
 Yes yes 
 Now which is it 
 Im sure of itLucifer Sam Siam cat

 Jennifer Gentle youre a witch 
 Youre the left side

 Dont leave the children on their own no no 
 Spoken Wrong Do it again 
 Time to go knock knock knock knock 
 See He keeps hanging up and its a man answering 
 Is there anybody out there 
 3Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze 
 I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea 
 I was thinking all about her burning with rage and desire 
 We were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire 
 She could take it back she might take it back someday 
 So I spied on her I lied to her I made promises I cannot keep 
 Then I hear her laughter rising rising from the deep 
 And I make her prove her love for me I take all that I can take 
 And I push her to the limit to see if she will break 
 She might take it back she could take it back some day 
 Ring a ring o roses 
 A pocket full of posies 
 Atishoo atishoo 
 We all fall down 
 Now I have seen the warnings screaming from all sides 
 Its easy to ignore them and God 
 knows Ive tried 
 All of this temptation it turned my faith to lies 
 Until I couldnt see the danger or hear the rising tide 
 She can take it back she will take it back some day 
 She will take it back she will take it back some dayHome home again 
 Calls the faithfull

 To hear the softly spoken magic spellsSpoken You yes you Stand still laddy 
 When we grew up and went to school 
 There were certain teachers who would 
 Hurt the children any way they could 
 By pouring their derision 
 Upon anything we did 
 And exposing every weakness 
 However carefully hidden by the kids 
 But in the town it was well known 
 When they got home at night their fat and 
 Psychopathic wives would thrash them 
 Within inches of their livesCome on my friends lets make for the hills 
 They say theres gold but Im looking for thrills 
 You can get your hands on whatever we find 
 Cause Im only coming along for the ride 
 Well you go your way Ill go mine 
 I dont care if we get there on time 
 Everybodys searching for something they say 
 Ill get my kicks on the way 
 Over the mountains across the sea 
 Who knows what may be waiting for me 
 I can sail forever to strange sounding names 
 Faces of people and places dont change 
 All I have to do is just close my eyes 
 To see the sea gulls wheeling in those far distant skies 
 All I wanna tell you all I wanna say 
 Is count me in on the journey 
 Dont expect me to stayWelcome my son 
 Welcome to the machine 
 Where have you been 
 Its all right we know where youve been 
 Youve been in the pipeline filling in time 
 Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys 
 You bought a guitar to punish your ma 
 You didnt like school and you know youre nobodys fool 
 So welcome to the machine 
 Welcome my son 
 What did you dream 
 Its all right we told you what to dream 
 You dreamed of a big star 
 He played a mean guitar 
 He always ate in the steak bar 
 He loved to drive in his Jaguar 
 So welcome to the machineArnold Layne had a strange hobby 
 Collecting clothes 
 Moonshine washing line 
 They suit him fine 
 On the wall hung a tall mirror 
 Distorted view 
 Seethrough baby blue 
 He dug it 
 Oh Arnold Layne its not the same 
 Takes two to know 
 Two to know 
 Why cant you see 
 Arnold Layne 
 Now hes caught a nasty sort of person 
 They gave him time 
 Doors bang chain gang 
 He hates it 
 Arnold Layne dont do it againA cloud of eiderdown draws around me softening the sound 
 Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side and shes breathing low 
 And the candle dies 
 When night comes down you lock the door 
 The book falls to the floor 
 As darkness falls and waves roll by 
 The seasons change the wind is warm 
 Now wakes the owl now sleeps the swan 
 Behold a dream the dream is gone 
 Green fields a cold rain is falling 
 In a golden dawn 
 And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds and I go down 
 And I rise like a bird in the haze when the first rays touch the sky 
 And the night winds dieJesus Jesus whats it all about 
 Tryin to clout these little ingrates into shape 
 When I was their age all the lights went out 
 There was no time to whine or mope about 
 And even now part of me flies over 
 Dresden at angels one five 
 Though theyll never fathom it behind my 
 Sarcasm desperate memories lie 
 Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep 
 Good 
 Thats the only time that I can really speak to you 
 And theres something that Ive locked away 
 A memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day 
 When we came back from the war 
 The banners and flags hung on everyones door 
 We danced and we sang in the streets 
 And the church bells ring 
 But burning in my heart 
 My memory smolders on 
 Of the gunners dying words 
 On the intercomI dont need no arms around me 
 And I dont need no drugs to calm me 
 I have seen the writing on the wall 
 Dont think I need anything at all 
 No dont think Ill need anything at all 
 All in all it was all just bricks in the wall 
 All in all you were all just bricks in the wallYou gotta be crazy you gotta have a real need 
 You gotta sleep on your toes and when youre on the street 
 You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed 
 And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight 
 You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking 
 And after a while you can work on points for style 
 Like the club tie and the firm handshake 
 A certain look in the eye and an easy smile 
 You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to 
 So that when they turn their backs on you 
 Youll get the chance to put the knife in 
 You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder 
 You know its going to get harder and harder and harder as you get older 
 And in the end youll pack up and fly down south hide your head in the sand 
 Just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer 
 And when you lose control youll reap the harvest you have sown 
 And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone 
 And its too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around 
 So have a good drown as you go down all alone 
 Dragged down by the stone 
 2 
 I gotta admit that Im a little bit confused 
 Sometimes it seems to me as if Im just being used 
 Gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise 
 If I dont stand my own ground how can I find my own way out of this maze 
 Deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending 
 That everyones expendable and no one has a real friend 
 And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner 
 And everythings done under the sun 
 And you believe at heart everyones a killer 
 Who was born in a house full of pain 
 Who was trained not to spit in the fan 
 Who was told what to do by the man 
 Who was broken by trained personnel 
 Who was fitted with collar and chain 
 Who was given a pat on the back 
 3 
 Who was breaking away from the pack 
 Who was only a stranger at home 
 Who was ground down in the end 
 Who was found dead on the phone 
 Who was dragged down by the stone 
 4We bitch and we fight 
 Diss each other on sight 
 But this thing we do 
 These times you get 
 Rain or shine or stormy weather 
 This thing we do 
 With worldweary grace 
 Weve taken our places 
 We could curse it or nurse it 
 And give it a name 
 Or stay home by the fire 
 Failed by desire 
 Stoking the flames 
 But were here for the ride 
 Its Louder than words 
 This thing that we do 
 Louder than words 
 The way it unfurls 
 Its louder than words 
 The sum of our parts 
 The beat of our hearts 
 Is louder than words 
 The strings bend and slide 
 As the hours fly by 
 An old pair of shoes your favorite blues 
 Gonna tap out the rhythm 
 Lets go with the flow 
 Wherever it goes 
 Were more than alive 
 This thing they call soul 
 Is there with a pulse 
 Louder than wordsThere was a king who ruled the land 
 His majesty was in command 
 With silver eyes the scarlet eagle 
 Showered silver on the people 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 Whydyou have to leave me there 
 Hanging in my infant air waiting 
 You only have to read the lines of 
 Scribbly black and everything shines 
 Across the stream with wooden shoes 
 Bells to tell the king the news 
 A thousand misty riders 
 Climb up higher once upon a time 
 Wondering and dreaming 
 The words had different meaning 
 Yes they did 
 For all the time spent in that room 
 The dolls house darkness old perfume 
 And fairy stories held me high 
 On clouds of sunlight floating by 
 Tell me moreSunlight bright upon my pillow 
 Lighter than an eiderdown 
 Will she let the weeping willow 
 Wind his branches round 
 Julia dream dreamboat queen queen of all my dreams 
 Every night I turn the light out 
 Waiting for the velvet bride 
 Will the scaly armadillo 
 Find me where Im hiding 
 Will the misty master break me 
 Will the key unlock my mind 
 Will the following footsteps catch me 
 Am I really dying 
 Julia dream dreamboat queen queen of all my dreamsTake all your overgrown infants away somewhere 
 And build them a home a little place of their own

 Is everyone in 
 Are you having a nice time 
 Sieg Heil 
 Now the final solution can be appliedYou shout in your sleep 
 Perhaps the price is just too steep 
 Is your conscious at rest 
 If once put to the test 
 You awake with a start 
 To just the beating of your heart 
 Just one man beneath the sky 
 Just two ears just two eyes 
 You set sail across the sea 
 Of long past thoughts and memories 
 Childhoods end your fantasies 
 Merge with harsh realities 
 And then as the sail is hoist 
 You find your eyes are growing moist 
 And all the fears never voiced 
 Say you have to make the final choice 
 Who are you and who am I 
 To say we know the reason why 
 Some are born some men die 
 Beneath one infinite sky 
 Therell be war therell be peace 
 But everything one day will cease 
 All the iron turn to rust 
 All the proud men turn to dust 
 So all things time will mend 
 And so this song will endSpeech has allowed the communication of ideas enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible

 Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask 
 And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions 
 You can hide hide hide 
 Behind paranoid eyes 
 You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar 
 Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar 
 Laughing too loud at the rest of the world 
 With the boys in the crowd 
 Behind petrified eyes 
 You believed in their stories of fame fortune and glory 
 Now youre lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age 
 The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high 
 And you hide hide hide 
 Behind brown and mild eyesIt was just before dawn one miserable morning in black fortyfour 
 When the forward commander was told to sit tight when he asked that his men be withdrawn 
 And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while 
 And the Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives 
 And kind old King George sent mother a note when he heard that father was gone 
 It was I recall in the form of a scroll with gold leaf and all 
 And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs hidden away 
 And my eyes still grow damp to remember his majesty signed with his own rubber stamp 
 It was dark all around there was frost in the ground when the tigers broke free 
 And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C

 Oi Ive got a little black book with me poems in 
 Cpl Chuck Boyle Whos she 
 Sgt Carter She was Miss Armored Division in 1961 
 Cpl Chuck Boyle Howd you get to meet her 
 Ive got a little black book with my poems in 
 Ive got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in 
 When Im a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in 
 I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on 
 Got those swollen hand blues 
 Ive got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from 
 Ive got electric light 
 And Ive got second sight 
 Ive got amazing powers of observation 
 And that is how I know 
 When I try to get through 
 On the telephone to you 
 Therell be nobody home 
 Ive got the obligatory 
 Hendrix 
 perm 
 And the inevitable pinhole burns 
 All down the front of my favourite satin shirt 
 Ive got nicotine stains on my fingers 
 Ive got a silver spoon on a chain 
 Ive got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains 
 Ive got wild staring eyes 
 And Ive got a strong urge to fly 
 But Ive got nowhere to fly to 
 Ooooh babe when I pick up the phone 
 Spoken Surprise surprise surprise from Gomer Pyle show 
 Theres still nobody home 
 Ive got a pair of Gohills boots 
 And Ive got fading roots 
 Spoken Where the hell are you 
 Over 47 german planes were destroyed with the loss of only 15 of our own aircraft 
 Where the hell are you Simon 
 Machine gun sound followed by plane crashing 
 1Bridges burning brightly 
 Merging with the shadow 
 Flickering between the lines 
 Stolen moments 
 Floating softly on the air 
 Borne on wings of fire 
 And climbing higher 
 Ancient bonds are breaking 
 Moving all and changing sides 
 Dreaming of a new day 
 Cast aside the other way 
 Magic vision stirring 
 Kindled by the burning flames 
 Rise in her eyes 
 The door that stands ajar 
 The walls that once were high 
 Beyond the gilded cage 
 Beyond the reach of ties 
 The moment is at hand 
 She breaks the golden bandHarmlessly passing your time in the grassland away 
 Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air 
 You better watch out 
 There may be dogs about 
 Ive looked over Jordan and I have seen 
 Things are not what they seem 
 What do you get for pretending the dangers not real 
 Meek and obedient you follow the leader 
 Down welltrodden corridors into the valley of steel 
 What a surprise 
 A look of terminal shock in your eyes 
 Now things are really what they seem 
 No this is no bad dream 
 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want 
 He makes me down to lie 
 Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by 
 With bright knives He releaseth my soul 
 He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places 
 He converteth me to lamb cutlets 
 For lo He hath great power and great hunger 
 When cometh the day we lowly ones 
 Through quiet reflection and great dedication 
 Master the art of karate 
 Lo we shall rise up 
 And then well make the buggers eyes water 
 Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
 Wave upon wave of demented avengers 
 March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream 
 Have you heard the news 
 The dogs are dead 
 You better stay home 
 And do as youre told 
 Get out of the road if you want to grow oldDaddys flown across the ocean 
 Leaving just a memory 
 A snap shot in the family album 
 Daddy what else did you leave for me 
 Daddy whatd you leave behind for me 
 All in all it was just a brick in the wall 
 All in all it was all just bricks in the wallMother do you think theyll drop the bomb 
 Mother do you think theyll like this song 
 Mother do you think theyll try to break my balls 
 Mother should I build a wall 
 Mother should I run for President 
 Mother should I trust the government 
 Mother will they put me in the firing line 
 Is it just a waste of time 
 Hush now baby baby dont you cry 
 Mamas gonna make all of your nightmares come true 
 Mamas gonna put all of her fears into you 
 Mamas gonna keep you right here under her wing 
 She wont let you fly but she might let you sing 
 Mamas gonna keep baby cozy and warm 
 Ooh babe ooh babe ooh babe 
 Of course Mamas gonna help build the wall 
 Mother do you think shes good enough 
 For me 
 Mother do you think shes dangerous 
 To me 
 Mother will she tear your little boy apart 
 Mother will she break my heart 
 Hush my baby baby dont you cry 
 Mamas gonna check out all your girlfriends for you 
 Mama wont let anyone dirty get through 
 Mamas gonna wait up til you get in 
 Mama will always find out where youve been 
 Mamas gonna keep baby healthy and clean 
 Ooh baby ooh babe ooh babe 
 Youll always be a baby to me 
 Mother did it need to be so highAye an a bit o mackerel fiddler rack and fear 
 And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow 
 Well I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied 
 And I cried cried cried 
 The fear of fallin down aft taken never back to rise 
 And then cried Mary and I tucked up 
 Wi a Claymore out and about 
 And I run down down the mechyn sty 
 And back on fiery hore that was fallin around the feet 
 Never I cried Never shall ye get me alive 
 Ye rotten hound of the Burnie Brae 
 Well I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust 
 And I fell down before him round his feet 
 Aye a roar he cried Frae the bottom of his heart 
 That I would nay fall but dead dead as a can by a feat deah 
 And the wind cried Mary 
 Thank YouThey disembarked in 45 
 And no one spoke and no one smiled 
 There were too many spaces in the line 
 Gathered at the cenotaph 
 All agreed with hand on heart 
 To sheath the sacrificial knifes 
 Sieg Heil 
 But now she stands upon Southampton dock 
 With her handkerchief and her summer frock 
 Clings to her wet body in the rain 
 In quiet desperation 
 Knuckles white upon the slippery reins 
 She bravely waves the boys goodbye again 
 Still the dark stain spreads between their shoulder blades 
 A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves 
 When the fight was over we spent what they had made 
 But in the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cutCareful with that axe EugeneBeyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young 
 In a world of magnets and miracles 
 Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary 
 The ringing of the division bell had begun 
 Along the long road and on down the causeway 
 Do they still meet there by the Cut 
 There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps 
 Running before time took our dreams away 
 Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground 
 To a life consumed by slow decay 
 The grass was greener 
 The light was brighter 
 With friends surrounded 
 The nights of wonder 
 Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us 
 To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side 
 Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again 
 Dragged by the force of some inner tide 
 At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
 We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world 
 Encumbered forever by desire and ambition 
 Theres a hunger still unsatisfied 
 Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon 
 Though down this road weve been so many times 
 The taste was sweeter 
 The dawn mist glowing 
 The water flowing 
 The endless river 
 Forever and ever 
 Spoken 
 Hello 
 Yes 
 Is that Charlie 
 Yes 
 Hello Charlie 
 Great 
 1On the turning away 
 From the pale and downtrodden 
 And the words they say which we wont understand 
 Dont accept that whats happening 
 Is just a case of others suffering 
 Or youll find that youre joining in 
 The turning away 
 Its a sin that somehow 
 Light is changing to shadow 
 And casting its shroud over all we have known 
 Unaware how the ranks have grown 
 Driven on by a heart of stone 
 We could find that were all alone 
 In the dream of the proud 
 On the wings of the night 
 As the daytime is stirring 
 Where the speechless unite in a silent accord 
 Using words you will find are strange 
 Mesmerised as they light the flame 
 Feel the new wind of change 
 No more turning away 
 From the weak and the weary 
 No more turning away from the coldness inside 
 Just a world that we all must share 
 Its not enough just to stand and stare 
 Is it only a dream that therell be 
 No more turning awayLeave when I ask you to leave Lucy 
 Please fall away from me Lucy 
 Oh go little girl 
 See that Im so broken up about you Lucy 
 Mean treatin me and done me harm Lucy 
 Been in love with you and your charms Lucy 
 Im in love with you Lucy 
 You got my heart you got my heart oh no 
 You tear me apart you just wont let me go 
 You hold on so tight so tight I just cant breathe 
 Now Lucy leave Lucy 
 Leave when I ask you to leave little girl 
 Please fall away from me little girl 
 Yeah go little girl 
 See that Im so broke up about you Lucy 
 Yeah girlIm so afraid of mistakes that I made 
 Shaking every time that I awake 
 I feel like a cardboard cutout man 
 So build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 And the storyline is kind 
 Ive aged and aged since the first page 
 Ive lived every line that you wrote 
 Take me down take me down 
 From the shelf above your head 
 And build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 I live far enough on the shelf like the rest 
 And the epilogue reads like a sad song 
 Please pick up your camera and use me again 
 YeahHeavy hung the canopy of blue 
 Shade my eyes and I can see you 
 White is the light 
 That shines through the dress that you wore 
 She laid in the shadow of her wave 
 Hazy were the visions overplayed 
 Sunlight on her eyes 
 But moonshine made her blind every time 
 Green is the colour of her kind 
 Quickness of the eye deceives the mind 
 Envy is the bond 
 Between the hopeful and the damnedAll alone or in twos 
 The ones who really love you 
 Walk up and down outside the wall 
 Some hand in hand 
 And some gathered together in bands 
 The bleeding hearts and the artists 
 Make their stand 
 And when theyve given you their all 
 Some stagger and fall after all its not easy 
 Banging your heart against some mad buggers 
 Wall 
 Spoken Isnt this where 
 2A restless eye across a weary room 
 A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin 
 The music played and played as we whirled without end 
 No hint no word her honour to defend 
 I will I will 
 she sighed to my request 
 And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test 
 Then drowned in desire our souls on fire 
 I lead the way to the funeral pyre 
 And without a thought of the consequence 
 I gave in to my decadence 
 One slip and down the hole we fall 
 It seems to take no time at all 
 A momentary lapse of reason 
 That binds a life for life 
 A small regret you wont forget 
 Therell be no sleep in here tonight 
 Was it love or was it the idea of being in love 
 Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove 
 The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown 
 The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone 
 That binds a life to a life 
 You wont regret you will never forget 
 One slip  one slipAnd I am not frightened of dying Any time will do I dont mind 
 Why should I be frightened of dying Theres no reason for it youve gotta go sometime 
 I never said I was frightened of dyingWalk with me Sydney 
 I love to love to love to baby you know 
 Walk with me Sydney 
 I love to love to love to love to love to 
 Walk with me Sydney its a dark night 
 Come on come on hold me tight 
 Well I love to love to love to 
 But I got 
 Flat feet fallen arches 
 Baggy knees and a broken frame 
 Meningitis peritonitis 
 DTs and a washedout brain 
 Roll with me Sydney 
 Roll with me Sydney its a dark night 
 Roll me roll me roll me high 
 DTs and a washedout brainIt would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 Everybody wakes and in the morning 
 Hot tea and cant stop yawning 
 Pass the butter please 
 Have you ever read the Daily Standard 
 Reading all about the plane thats landed 
 Upside down 
 And no one knows what I did today 
 There can be no other way 
 But I would just like to say 
 Everybody cares about the weather 
 And everybody should know better 
 What a waste of time 
 Everybody lives beneath the ceiling 
 Living out a dream that sends them reeling 
 To a distant place 
 But no one knows what I did today 
 To meet sometimeFor millions of years mankind lived just like the animals 
 Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination 
 We learned to talk 
 Theres a silence surrounding me 
 I cant seem to think straight 
 Ill sit in the corner 
 And no one can bother me 
 I think I should speak now Why wont you talk to me 
 I cant seem to speak now You never talk to me 
 My words wont come out right What are you thinking 
 I feel like Im drowning What are you feeling 
 Im feeling weak now Why wont you talk to me 
 But I cant show my weakness You never talk to me 
 I sometimes wonder What are you thinking 
 Where do we go from here What are you feeling 
 It doesnt have to be like this 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking 
 Why wont you talk to me I feel like Im drowning 
 You never talk to me You know I cant breathe now 
 What are you thinking Were going nowhere 
 What are you feeling Were going nowhere 
 Why wont you talk to me 
 You never talk to me 
 What are you thinking 
 Where do we go from here 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talkingDoes anybody here remember Vera Lynn 
 Remember how she said that we would meet again some sunny day 
 Vera Vera what has become of you 
 Does anybody else in here feel the way I doLime and limpid green a second scene 
 A fight between the blue you once knew 
 Floating down the sound resounds 
 Around the icy waters underground 
 Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda 
 And Titania Neptune Titan 
 Stars can frighten 
 Blinding signs flap 
 Flicker flicker flicker blam pow pow 
 Stairway scared Dan Dare whos there 
 Lime and limpid green 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters under 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters undergroundMarshall Dillon Well only about an hour of daylight left We better get started 
 Miss Tyson Is it unsafe to travel at night

 Miss Tyson Goodbye Chengra

 Is there anybody out thereWhen youre one of the few to land on your feet 
 What do you do to make ends meet 
 Teach 
 Make them mad make them sad 
 Make them add two and two 
 Or make them me or make them you 
 Make them do what you want them to 
 Make em lie down and dieI was standing by the Nile 
 When I saw the lady smile 
 I would take her for a while 
 For a while 
 Like tears wept like a child 
 How her golden hair was blowing wild 
 Then she spread her wings to fly 
 For to fly 
 Soaring high above the breezes 
 Going always where she pleases 
 She will make it to the island in the Sun 
 I will follow in her shadow 
 And Ill watch her from my window 
 One day I will catch her eye 
 She is calling from the deep 
 Summoning my soul to endless sleep 
 She is bound to drag me down 
 Drag me downWhen that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Summerevening birds are calling 
 Summer Sunday and a year 
 The sound of music in my ears 
 Distant bells newmown grass 
 Smells so sweet 
 By the river holding hands 
 Roll me up and lay me down 
 And if you see dont make a sound 
 Pick your feet up off the ground 
 And if you hear as the warm night folds 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange 
 Sing to me sing to me 
 When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Childrens laughter in my ears 
 The last sunlight disappears 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange 
 Summerevening birds are callingI have always been here 
 I have always looked out from behind these eyes 
 It feels like more than a lifetime 
 Feels like more than a lifetime 
 Sometimes I get tired of the waiting 
 Sometimes I get tired of being in here 
 Is this the way its always been 
 Could it ever have been different 
 Do you ever get tired of the waiting 
 Do you ever get tired of being in there 
 Dont worry nobody lives forever 
 Nobody lives foreverWe dont need no education 
 We dont need no thought control 
 No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
 Teacher leave them kids alone 
 Hey teacher leave them kids alone 
 All in all its just another brick in the wall 
 All in all youre just another brick in the wall 
 We dont need no education 
 Teachers leave them kids alone 
 Hey teacher leave us kids alone 
 Wrong Do it again Wrong Do it again

 Showing feelings of an almost human nature

 The Judge 
 The evidence before the court is 
 Incontravertable theres no need for 
 The jury to retire 
 In all my years of judging 
 I have never heard before of 
 Someone more deserving of 
 The full penalty of law 
 The way you made them suffer 
 Your exquisite wife and mother 
 Fills me with the urge to defecate 
 Man in audience 
 Go on Judge shit on him

 Deepest fear 
 I sentence you to be exposed before 
 Your peers

 Spaces where we used to talk

 How should I complete the wall 
 1I will always be in here 
 I will always look out from behind these eyes 
 Its only a lifetime 
 Its only a lifetimeThere was a boy whose name was Jim 
 His friends they were very good to him 
 They gave him tea and cakes and jam 
 And slices of delicious ham 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 The chief defect of Henry King 
 Was chewing little bits of string 
 At last he swallowed some which tied 
 Itself in ugly knots inside 
 The words have different meanings 
 Yes they did 
 Finding she was left alone 
 Went tiptoe to the telephone 999 
 Summoned the immediate aid 
 Of Londons Noble Fire Brigade 
 Tell me moreDogs of war and men of hate 
 With no cause we dont discriminate 
 Discovery is to be disowned 
 Our currency is flesh and bone 
 Hell opened up and put on sale 
 Gather round and haggle 
 For hard cash we will lie and deceive 
 Even our masters dont know the webs we weave 
 One world its a battleground 
 One world and we will smash it down 
 One world  One world 
 Invisible transfers long distance calls 
 Hollow laughter in marble halls 
 Steps have been taken a silent uproar 
 Has unleashed the dogs of war 
 You cant stop what has begun 
 Signed sealed they deliver oblivion 
 We all have a dark side to say the least 
 And dealing in death is the nature of the beast 
 One world 
 The dogs of war dont negotiate 
 The dogs of war wont capitulate 
 They will take and you will give 
 And you must die so that they may live 
 You can knock at any door 
 But wherever you go you know theyve been there before 
 Well winners can lose and things can get strained 
 But whatever you change you know the dogs remain 
 One world  One worldI am just a new boy 
 A stranger in this town 
 Where are all the good times 
 Whos gonna show this stranger around 
 Ooh I need a dirty woman 
 Ooh I need a dirty girl 
 Will some cold woman in this desert land 
 Make me feel like a real man 
 Take this rock and roll refugee 
 Oooh babe set me free 
 Yes a collect call for Mrs Floyd from Mr Floyd 
 Will you accept the charges from United States 
 Oh he hung up Thats your residence right I wonder why he hung up Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer 
 This is United States calling are we reaching 
 See He keeps hanging up and its a man answeringThe black and green scarecrow as everyone knows 
 Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere he didnt care 
 He stood in a field where barley grows 
 His head did no thinking his arms didnt move 
 Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground 
 The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me 
 But now hes resigned to his fate cause lifes not unkind he doesnt mind 
 He stood in a field where barley growsI was in the kitchen 
 Seamus thats the dog was outside 
 Well I was in the kitchen 
 Seamus my old hound was outside 
 Well you know the sun was sinking slowly 
 And my old hounddog sat right down and criedIn a churchyard by a river 
 Lazing in the haze of midday 
 Laughing in the grasses and the graves 
 Yellow bird you are not long 
 In singing and in flying on 
 In laughing and in leaving 
 Willow weeping in the water 
 Waving to the river daughters 
 Swaying in the ripples and the reeds 
 On a trip to Cirrus Minor 
 Saw a crater in the Sun 
 A thousand miles of moonlight laterWe smile and smile 
 We smile and smile 
 Laughter echoes in your eyes 
 We climb and climb 
 Footfalls softly in the pines 
 We cry and cry 
 Sadness passes in a while 
 We roll and roll 
 Help me roll away the stoneInto the distance a ribbon of black 
 Stretched to the point of no turning back 
 A flight of fancy on a windswept field 
 Standing alone my senses reeled 
 A fatal attraction is holding me fast 
 How can I escape this irresistible grasp 
 Cant keep my eyes from the circling sky 
 Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I 
 Ice is forming on the tips of my wings 
 Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything 
 No navigator to find my way home 
 Unladened empty and turned to stone 
 A soul in tension thats learning to fly 
 Condition grounded but determined to try 
 Cant keep my eyes from the circling skies

 Threeeightecho 
 Easy on the brakes Take it easy Its gonna roll this time 
 Just handle the power gradually and it 
 Above the planet on a wing and a prayer 
 My grubby halo a vapour trail in the empty air 
 Across the clouds I see my shadow fly 
 Out of the corner of my watering eye 
 A dream unthreatened by the morning light 
 Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night 
 Theres no sensation to compare with this 
 Suspended animation a state of bliss 
 Cant keep my mind from the circling sky 
 Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit IHey you out there in the cold 
 Getting lonely getting old 
 Can you feel me 
 Hey you standing in the aisles 
 With itchy feet and fading smiles 
 Hey you dont help them to bury the light 
 Dont give in without a fight 
 Hey you out there on your own 
 Sitting naked by the phone 
 Would you touch me 
 Hey you with your ear against the wall 
 Waiting for someone to call out 
 Hey you would you help me to carry the stone 
 Open your heart Im coming home 
 But it was only fantasy 
 The wall was too high 
 As you can see 
 No matter how he tried 
 He could not break free 
 And the worms ate into his brain 
 Hey you out there on the road 
 Always doing what youre told 
 Can you help me 
 Hey you out there beyond the wall 
 Breaking bottles in the hall 
 Hey you dont tell me theres no hope at all 
 Together we stand divided we fall

 Here is a loud announcement 
 f Remergence 
 Silence in the studioUs and them 
 And after all were only ordinary men 
 Me and you 
 God only knows its not what we would choose to do 
 Forward he cried from the rear 
 And the front rank died 
 And the General sat and the lines on the map 
 Moved from side to side 
 Black and blue 
 And who knows which is which and who is who 
 Up and down 
 And in the end its only round and round and round 
 Havent you heard its a battle of words 
 The poster bearer cried 
 Listen son said the man with the gun 
 Theres room for you inside 
 I mean theyre gonna kill ya So like if you give em a quick sh short sharp shock they dont do it again Dig it I mean he get off light cos I couldve given him a thrashing I only hit him once  Its only a difference of right and wrong innit I mean good manners dont cost nothing do they eh 
 Down and out 
 It cant be helped but theres a lot of it about 
 With without 
 And wholl deny its what the fightings all about 
 Out of the way its a busy day 
 Ive got things on my mind 
 For want of the price of tea and a slice 
 The old man diedWhere were you when I was burned and broken 
 While the days slipped by from my window watching 
 And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless 
 Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me 
 While you were hanging yourself on someone elses words 
 Dying to believe in what you heard 
 I was staring straight into the shining sun 
 Lost in thought and lost in time 
 While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted 
 Outside the rain fell dark and slow 
 While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime 
 I took a heavenly ride through our silence 
 I knew the moment had arrived 
 For killing the past and coming back to life 
 I knew the waiting had begun 
 And headed straight into the shining sunSpoken Look mummy theres an aeroplane up in the sky 
 Ooh 
 Did did did did you see the frightened ones 
 Did did did did you hear the falling bombs 
 Did did did did you ever wonder 
 Why we had to run for shelter 
 When the promise of a brave new world 
 Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky 
 The flames are all longgone 
 But the pain lingers on 
 Goodbye blue sky 
 Spoken The 1115 from Newcastle is now approaching 
 The 1118 arrivalI want to tell you a story 
 About a little man if I can 
 A gnome named Grimble Gromble 
 And little gnomes stay in their homes 
 Eating sleeping drinking their wine 
 He wore a scarlet tunic 
 A bluegreen hood it looked quite good 
 He had a big adventure 
 Amidst the grass fresh air at last 
 Wining dining biding his time 
 And then one day 
 Hooray another way for gnomes to say 
 Ooh my 
 Look at the sky look at the river 
 Isnt it good 
 Winding finding places to go 
 Ooh my ooh myFar far far far away way 
 People heard him say say 
 I will find a way way 
 There will come a day day 
 Something will be done 
 Then at last the mighty ship descending on a point of flame 
 Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall 
 Now now now is the time time time 
 To be be be aware 
 Carters father saw it there 
 And knew the Rhull revealed to him 
 The living soul of Hereward the Wake 
 Oh my something in my eye eye 
 Something in the sky sky 
 Waiting there for me 
 The outer lock rolled slowly back 
 The servicemen were heard to sigh 
 For there revealed in flowing robes was Lucy in the sky 
 Oh oh did you ever 
 No no never ever will they 
 Ill say 
 Summoning his cosmic power 
 And glowing slightly from his toes 
 His psychic emanations flowedEmily tries but misunderstands 
 Shes often inclined to borrow somebodys dreams till tomorrow 
 There is no other day 
 Lets try it another way 
 Youll lose your mind and play 
 Free games for may 
 See Emily play 
 Soon after dark Emily cries 
 Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow 
 Put on a gown that touches the ground 
 Float on a river forever and ever 
 Emily Emily 
 See Emily playDid you know it was all going to go so wrong for you 
 And did you see it was all going to be so right for me 
 Why did we tell you then 
 You were always the golden boy then 
 And that youd never lose that light in your eyes 
 Hey you did you ever realise what youd become 
 And did you see that it wasnt only me you were running from 
 Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway 
 Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes 
 The rain fell slow down on all the roofs of uncertainty 
 I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me 
 And did you know 
 I never thought that youd lose that light in your eyesMarigolds are very much in love 
 But he doesnt mind 
 Picking up sister 
 He makes his way in to the seesaw land 
 All the way up she smiles 
 She goes up while he goes down down 
 Sits on a stick in the river 
 Laughter in his sleep 
 Sisters throwing stones hoping for a hit 
 He doesnt know so then 
 Another time another day 
 A brothers way to leave 
 Another time another day day day day 
 Shes selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon 
 Picking up weeds 
 She hasnt got time to care 
 All can see hes not there 
 She grows up for another man and hes down 
 A brothers way to leaveIts awfully considerate of you to think of me here 
 And Im most obliged to you for making it clear that Im not here 
 And I never knew the moon could be so big 
 And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
 And Im grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
 And brought me here instead dressed in red 
 And Im wondering who could be writing this song 
 I dont care if the sun dont shine 
 And I dont care if nothing is mine 
 And I dont care if Im nervous with you 
 Ill do my loving in the winter 
 And the sea isnt green 
 And I love the Queen 
 And what exactly is a dream 
 And what exactly is a jokeGot a fliptop pack of cigarettes in her pocket 
 Feeling good at the top 
 Shopping in sharp shoes 
 Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool 
 But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores 
 Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores 
 Apples and oranges 
 Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly 
 To meet the people 
 Shes on time again 
 And then 
 I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think 
 What a funny thing to do cause Im feeling very pink 
 I love she 
 She loves me 
 See you 
 Apples and oranges 
 Thought you might like to know 
 Im the lorry driver man 
 Shes on the run 
 Down by the river side 
 Feeding ducks in the afternoon tide quack quack 
 Apples and orangesHey Eugene this is Henry McClean 
 And Ive finished my beautiful flying machine 
 And Im ringing to say 
 That Im leaving and maybe 
 Youd like to fly with me 
 And hide with me baby 
 Isnt it strange how little we change 
 Isnt it sad were insane 
 Playing the games that we know end in tears 
 The games weve been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands and 
 Jumps into his cosmic flyer 
 Pulls his plastic collar higher 
 Light the fuse and stand right back 
 He cried This is my last goodbye 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 And if you survive till two thousand and five 
 I hope youre exceedingly thin 
 For if you are stout you will have to breathe out 
 While the people around you breathe in breathe in breathe in breathe in 
 People pushing on my sides 
 Is something that I hate 
 And so is sitting down to eat 
 With only little capsules on my plate 
 And all weve got to say to you is goodbye 
 Its time to go better run and get your bags its goodbye 
 Nobody cry its goodbye 
 Crash crash crash crash goodbye 
 Crash crash crash crash goodbyeAs you look around this room tonight 
 Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
 Do you want my blood do you want my tears 
 What do you want 
 What do you want from me 
 Should I sing until I cant sing anymore 
 Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
 Youre so hard to please 
 What do you want from me 
 Do you think that I know something you dont know 
 If I dont promise you the answers would you go 
 Should I stand out in the rain 
 Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
 Im not the one you need 
 You can have anything you want 
 You can drift you can dream even walk on water 
 Anything you want 
 You can own everything you see 
 Sell your soul for complete control 
 Is that really what you need 
 You can lose yourself this night 
 See inside there is nothing to hide 
 Turn and face the light 
 What do you want from meOverhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air 
 And deep beneath the rolling waves 
 In labyrinths of coral caves 
 The echo of a distant time 
 Comes willowing across the sand 
 And everything is green and submarine 
 And noone showed us to the land 
 And noone knows the wheres or whys 
 But something stirs and something tries 
 Now starts to climb towards the light 
 Strangers passing in the street 
 By chance two separate glances meet 
 And I am you and what I see is me 
 And do I take you by the hand 
 And lead you through the land 
 And help me understand the best I can 
 And noone calls us to move on 
 And noone forces down our eyes 
 Noone speaks and noone tries 
 Noone flies around the sun 
 Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes 
 Inviting and inciting me to rise 
 And through the window in the wall 
 Come streaming in on sunlight wings 
 A million bright ambassadors of morning 
 And noone sings me lullabies 
 And noone makes me close my eyes 
 So I throw the windows wide 
 And call to you across the skyRemember when you were young 
 You shone like the sun 
 Now theres a look in your eyes 
 Like black holes in the sky 
 You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom 
 Blown on the steel breeze 
 Come on you target for faraway laughter 
 Come on you stranger you legend you martyr and shine 
 You reached for the secret too soon 
 You cried for the moon 
 Threatened by shadows at night 
 And exposed in the light 
 Well you wore out your welcome with random precision 
 Rode on the steel breeze 
 Come on you raver you seer of visions 
 Come on you painter you piper you prisoner and shineOh my girl sitting in the sun 
 Go buy candy and a currant bun 
 I like to see you run 
 Lay back 
 Ooh dont talk to me 
 Please just walk with me 
 Please you know Im feeling frail 
 Its true sun shining very bright 
 Its you who Im gonna love tonight 
 Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon 
 Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon 
 Ooh dont touch me child 
 Please you know you drive me wild 
 Drive me wild 
 Dont try another cat 
 Dont go where other you must know 
 Im very very very frail 
 Oh my girl sitting in the sun 
 And flyLittle by little the night turns around 
 Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn 
 Lotuses lean on each other in yearning 
 Under the eaves the swallow is resting 
 Set the controls for the heart of the Sun 
 Over the mountain watching the watcher 
 Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine 
 One inch of love is one inch of shadow 
 Love is the shadow that ripens the wine 
 The heart of the Sun the heart of the Sun 
 Witness the man who raves at the wall 
 Making the shape of his question to Heaven 
 Whether the sun will fall in the evening 
 Will he remember the lesson of giving 
 The heart of the Sun the heart of the SunAll that you touch 
 And all that you see 
 All that you taste 
 All you feel 
 And all that you love 
 And all that you hate 
 All you distrust 
 All you save 
 And all that you give 
 And all that you deal 
 And all that you buy 
 Beg borrow or steal 
 And all you create 
 And all you destroy 
 And all that you do 
 And all that you say 
 And all that you eat 
 And everyone you meet everyone you meet 
 And all that you slight 
 And everyone you fight 
 And all that is now 
 And all that is gone 
 And all thats to come 
 And everything under the sun is in tune 
 But the sun is eclipsed by the moon 
 There is no dark side in the moon really Matter of fact its all darkYou know that I care what happens to you 
 And I know that you care for me too 
 So I dont feel alone 
 Or the weight of the stone 
 Now that Ive found somewhere safe 
 To bury my bone 
 And any fool knows a dog needs a home 
 A shelter from pigs on the wingWell Im a king bee 
 Buzzing around your hive 
 Yes Im a king bee child 
 I can make good honey 
 Let me come inside 
 Im young and able 
 To buzz all night long 
 You know Im young and able 
 When you hear me buzz little girl 
 You know theres some stinging going on 
 Well buzz 
 Oh sting 
 Yeah 
 Well Im a king bee 
 Can buzz all night long 
 Yes Im a king bee 
 Well I can buzz better baby 
 When your man is goneIf I were a swan Id be gone 
 If I were a train Id be late 
 And if I were a good man 
 Id talk with you more often than I do 
 If I were asleep I could dream 
 If I were afraid I could hide 
 If I go insane 
 Please dont put your wires in my brain 
 If I were the moon Id be cool 
 If I were the rule I would bend 
 If I were a good man 
 Id understand the spaces between friends 
 If I were alone I would cry 
 And if I were with you Id be home and dry 
 And if I go insane 
 Will you still let me join in with the game 
 If I were a swan Id be gone 
 If I were a train Id be late again 
 Id talk with you more often than I doBig man pig man 
 Ha ha charade you are 
 You wellheeled big wheel 
 And when your hand is on your heart 
 Youre nearly a good laugh 
 Almost a joker 
 With your head down in the pig bin 
 Saying Keep on digging 
 Pig stain on your fat chin 
 What do you hope to find 
 Down in the pig mine 
 Youre nearly a laugh 
 But youre really a cry 
 Bus stop rat bag 
 You fucked up old hag 
 You radiate cold shafts of broken glass 
 Almost worth a quick grin 
 You like the feel of steel 
 Youre hot stuff with a hat pin 
 And good fun with a hand gun 
 Hey you 
 Whitehouse 
 You houseproud town mouse 
 Youre trying to keep our feelings off the street 
 Youre nearly a real treat 
 All tight lips and cold feet 
 And do you feel abused 
 You gotta stem the evil tide 
 And keep it all on the inside 
 Mary youre nearly a treat 
 But youre really a crywe came in 
 So ya thought ya might like to go to the show 
 Tell me is something eluding you sunshine 
 Is this not what you expected to see 
 If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes 
 Youll just have to claw your way through this disguise 
 Lights 
 Roll the sound effects 
 Action 
 Drop it 
 Drop it on em
