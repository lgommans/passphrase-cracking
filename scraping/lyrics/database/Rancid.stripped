 The prophet speaks his language reeks 
 A vile dogma that schemes and sneaks 
 His blood is weak hes an oil sheik 
 Information leak operation tweek 
 Theres no security in the battlefield 
 Metal cannons shape the human shields 
 A brand new country theyre gonna build 
 One more riot thats selfwilled 
 State out of control 
 Its out of control 
 Were outta control were outta control 
 Were outta control were outta control 
 Inject the poison into the bloodstream 
 Pick up your shovel do what youre told 
 The probe is out the watchdog grows 
 To incredible lengths to incredible lows 
 Well off your target now you have missed 
 Deliberate lying and recklessness 
 Dont get crushed in the iron fist 
 Resist resist resist resist resist 
 Control 
 Were outta controlNever seen it come back again till it dragged my heart around 
 There was nothing coming in and there was nothing to be found 
 See I dont know if I can go through another day like this 
 Americas judging its favorite son and there aint nowhere missing 
 Cause Ive seen it cause I know it 
 Cause its the end of the world tonight 
 Take it down brbrbreak it down cause it aint coming back again 
 And the feeling of the rhythm drums it sings like me 
 See I dont like it you know I  and the rhythm would make you aware 
 Cause this is the end and I wish it was something better than this 
 Thats rightEverybody saying we gotta take a chance 
 And telling me what the hell went wrong 
 We only listen to the words that we sing 
 Now a million are singing along 
 Last one 
 We got it right you got wrong 
 Were still around last one to die 
 Were going up youre going down 
 The ones that counted us out 
 Regret that they picked the fight 
 We sit on top of the world 
 And were proving it every night 
 We got it right you got wrong 
 Through the storm and the gigs 
 And the good and the bad 
 There aint no doubt 
 We knew from the very first show what it was all about 
 Were still around last one to dieWoooooooooh 
 Ghost band ghost band 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our songs now 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our song 
 And they knew all the lyrics by heart now 
 And they play in the perfect key 
 And their tombstones are silhouetted 
 And the band I can barely see 
 Well our spirit fades hard and cheated 
 When the funerals over I cant leave it 
 Everyones going home Im defeated 
 Woooooooooh 
 And the energys so overwhelming 
 And the echo from the crowd is deafening 
 And the music conveyed is convincing 
 And the world doesnt seem so daunting 
 And the shimmer of light tells you secrets 
 In the moon the silhouettes in an instance 
 And we are seen in perfect cadence 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our songI get violent when Im fucked up 
 I get silent when Im drugged up 
 I want excitement if I dont get none I go wild 
 I dont know what the fuck to do about it 
 If you play the game you get nothing out of it 
 So find out for yourself tryin to be good 
 You better cheat cheat 
 No reason to play fair 
 Cheat cheat you cant get anywhere 
 Cheat cheat if you cant win 
 Nobody knows what the fuck theyre doin 
 Its beyond their control Friday nights a ruin 
 If you wanna survive you better learn how to lie 
 Dont you use the rules 
 Theyre not for you theyre for the fools 
 And youre a fool if you dont know that 
 So use the rules you fuckin foolIf the police come 
 And tromp the state 
 And theres a straight crisis 
 And melee 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go let go let go disgruntled 
 Reflect something 
 Of course you descend 
 Fighting conflict 
 Running fugitive 
 If the police come 
 And meleeThey assumed I was guilty when I committed no crime 
 They said confessions bring lenience 
 So they put me on the line 
 So I protest a massacres at the Tineman Square 
 My friend said yo stay away man you better not go fuckin back there oh 
 They wouldnt let me write about my opinions about the state 
 And the freedom of expression they would never tolerate 
 And the military secrets that I never did steal 
 I didnt start no violence no and there was nobody that I killed 
 So I had a clear account of all the abuses of power 
 And the memories of homeland now gone sour 
 And I only got one weapon and its so plain for me to see 
 My only weapon I call poetry 
 And I dont even know why 
 The truth seems like lie 
 In My cell there is no sky 
 When I was arrested in shanghai 
 In the wealth and privilege huh I was not born 
 But devotion and freedom and liberty I was sworn 
 So every emotion is studied watched and controlled 
 Who gets paid who gets disciplined and who gets rolled so 
 Transmitter beams my coordinates anywhere on earth 
 And as radio waves surviellence satalite burst 
 Open up your skull and let some knowledge come in 
 Yeah crack open the cranium and let awareness begin oh 
 When I was arrested in shanghaiHey you in the red dress 
 I know youre not trying to impress me 
 In line from a distance 
 Too scared at all to ask your name 
 All alone in the dark summer night 
 And I regret to this day 
 That I never got your name

 Waiting waiting for an invitation

 With a gleaming success with the different tribes 
 Religious indifference mixed between the lies 
 Territorial companies they legitimize 
 Persecution to form enterprise 
 Now the UN is called to buffer it all 
 The problem is spreading international 
 Like Irelands Belfast its coming to be 
 A brand new key 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test 
 Shes got a new dress

 Well entertain the idea of a peaceful end 
 Serb tanks slow down to the used to been 
 Of a world which has seen the citizens die 
 While the innocent children play near by now

 Another truth were bombing us 
 The time of civil war is shoot or I live 
 The chivalrous ones are never represented 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test Yeah 
 Yugoslavias been blown to bits Yeah 
 Allocating people for impurity 
 The methods of severance are dastardly 
 Try to cleanse the hands of the murdering 
 But the appendage of guilt is lingering 
 Shadows of soldiers lay nearby 
 The dead ones finally reach a compromise 
 Consumption of war lies in Bosnia 
 The destruction of war lies in BosniaWell the kids are all hopped up and ready to go

 Hand good hand good face good face good

 When I hit that summer with an angel on my shoulder 
 Another day living another day older 
 Thank God I made it out this far 
 Tell my story to the boys with a guitar 
 Im lucky to wake a face upIf you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 Its just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 Living and dying and the stories that are true 
 The secret to a good life is knowing when your through 
 Sarah ceased existing long before she died 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle ride 
 If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle rideSmall sacrifices or otherwise few 
 Unity for the sake of the many forms 
 Oh they use imagination only few can go 
 Touch of madness only few ever know 
 Well you can go on your way 
 Or you can stagger through hell 
 You can lie on your back 
 Or you can stand up tall 
 In a state of confusion 
 Got nothing to do 
 I was connected respected 
 Watching you make it through 
 And all this rhetoric 
 They tell me to sing along

 I went way down she betrayed me 
 Now my vision is no longer hazy 
 Im very lucky to have my crew 
 They stood by me when she flew

 Michaels on his way to payback syndication

 Police state upon us 
 Prepare to collide 
 Theyre gonna keep you down 
 Step on your neck

 And I can see the line up now 
 Everyone is just partisan 
 You see one side claims victory 
 But its just a zero sum 
 Liberty and freedom 
 In quotations spray painted on the wall 
 Verbalized explosion 
 We will come back some day 
 If your ideas are suspect 
 Now youre in contempt 
 Report to the committee

 And the zealots and crusaders 
 They cant justify with threats 
 And intimidation 
 Designed to terrify 
 We will come back some dayGood morning heartache

 And my brother and my mother both visit me all the time 
 And visions of you are always running right through my mind 
 We always talk about what were gonna do when the war is won 
 Were gonna fix up them old cars and ride them into the sun 
 When I heard youre no longer with us man I was done 
 My friends made for meSet out to mislead sets out to murder 
 False appearance is everything to him 
 Is he good today or is he evil 
 In a violent craze spewing words of madness 
 It could go either way you never know

 My mind goes astray 
 Starts out in a way 
 I cried when I had no shoes 
 Till I met the man with no feet 
 Its just a 
 Holiday sunrise 
 I suddenly realized 
 I got no alibis 
 Relatives of mine said 
 They were born again 
 Fucked up world has made me born against 
 Im a sinner and my soul should be cleansed 
 Ill take my chances when Im deadTook the 60 bus out of downtown Campbell 
 Ben Zanotto he was on there he was waiting for me 
 All the punk rockers and the moon stompers are out 
 On the corners where theyre sparing for change 
 I started thinking you know I started drinking 
 I dont really remember too much of that day 
 Something struck me funny when we ran out of money 
 Where do you go now when youre only 15 
 With the music execution and the talk of revolution 
 It bleeds in me 
 And it goes 
 Give em the boot the roots the radicals 
 Give em the boot you know Im a radical 
 Give em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo 
 The radio was playing Desmond Dekker was singing 
 On the 43 bus as we climbed up the hill 
 Nothing incoming but the reggae drumming 
 And we all come from unloving homes I said 
 Why even bother and pick up the bottle 
 Mr bus driver please let these people on 
 Rudegirl Carol was a miniskirt girl 
 My blurry vision saw nothin wrong 
 On my stereo 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Took the 60 bus out of downtown Campbell 
 On the corners where theyre sparing for change 
 And the radio was playing Desmond Dekker was singing 
 On the 43 bus as we climbed up the hill 
 My blurry vision saw nothing wrong 
 It bleeds in me and it goesHey little sister 
 Do you know what time it was 
 When you finally seen 
 All your broken dreams 
 Come crashing down your door 
 They demand an answer 
 And they demand it quick 
 Or the questions fade 
 And then the wasted days 
 Come crawling back for more 
 And I said 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 And who pulls the strings 
 It starts and ends with you 
 The face of isolation 
 Well thats one you recognize 
 Well you cant get straight 
 Its a lonely place 
 And one you do despise 
 Boredom is for sale now 
 And helplessness you feel 
 Its a wounded dove 
 And the hawks are above 
 Blood splattered in a reel to reel 
 I was almost over 
 And my world was almost gone 
 And in a sudden rush 
 I could almost touch 
 The things that Id done wrong 
 My jungles made of concrete 
 And through the silence I could feel 
 My aim is true 
 And I will walk on through 
 These mountains made of steel 
 Oh I say it starts and ends with you 
 I say it starts and ends with youWheres my girl where has she gone 
 She once was beautiful and innocent 
 I cant believe in what she says 
 I look at her and she looked the other way 
 Disconnected from feeling all right 
 Disconnected and it aint black and white 
 Disconnected theres a sword through the dove 
 Disconnected from the country I love 
 I remember you when you we young and strong 
 In your summer dress and legs so long 
 My memories are only for me 
 I prefer them to reality 
 You think its over but you better think again 
 Neither grace nor sweetness just malicious intent 
 Its you and me baby so we better watch our back 
 Cause if we are standing together we aint never gonna crack 
 And we took the Greyhound into the night 
 With the city on the left and the country on the right 
 And I knew when I saw you I read it in your eyes 
 I heard your voice break when were trying not to die 
 Disconnected disconnected disconnected 
 Disconnected from the country I loveYou 
 For Weeks youre fallin 
 Guys are dien 
 Hit the call  Theyll call you back 
 Somenll use you too 
 Usin me usin you 
 What can ya do

 I fuckin hate you  Youre a rattlesnake 
 Yo 
 And I hate you  Youre a RattlesnakeI didnt trust him cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didnt go there I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite me 
 I saw some better days from Beijing to Hunter Place 
 A portrait of the sum of the last couple years 
 See I lost an image an image of chaos 
 All Ive ever known is isolation and pain 
 Im on the verge of losing everything every single day 
 In all this deadly drama you know I see myself fall 
 Ive been confusing 
 A lost canyon 
 Consuming it all 
 I didnt trust him cause he smiled at me first 
 So I may be antisocial and shy and yo I found myself a job 
 But I journey and complain through incredible odds 
 Its the simple things I guess a delicate balance 
 I never really thought I could make it all happen 
 Now the anarchist kid gives a fuck about you 
 I stood up every single time I fell 
 Its just you 
 Just as if it was to despite them 
 YeahI saw a man get the beat down 
 Took his money and his wallet left him dead on the ground 
 I saw them gather celebrate the crime 
 Teaching us the laughter another lesson of mankind 
 I raised my hand I got another question 
 If I start to riot will I get protection 
 Cause Im a kid whos got a lot of problems 
 If I throw a brick maybe the brick will go and solve them 
 Oh yeah I wanna riot 
 Im boiling up the citys on heat 
 Red alert tention you know its on the street 
 Code blue the city of the dead 
 Sirens in the night with the lights bloody red 
 See how we do this see how we ride 
 Throw a brick light the fuse dodge a bullet duck inside 
 A statistic hammered on my brain 
 Branded with another nother pawn in the game 
 Oh yeah I wanna riot 
 In front of me perpetuated 
 Crying in line I got a burning to be 
 My face is burning burning so quick 
 Burning like a candle at the end of its wick 
 Well I turn the dial I turn the channel 
 I turn it to a arab fighting the eternal battle 
 I need some help man there is no doubt 
 If Im gonna go down Im gonna take somebody out 
 Riot

 Shes the one all alone I come lookin 
 Smoke and mirrors as I watch 
 Aw that girl was trippin 
 Its no fun lost again 
 To have your heart broken 
 Greed is from a world that is built on hustling 
 The breaks were falling when they had failed 
 Every road can lead ya straight down to fucking hell 
 Rain stopped falling when they had failed 
 Every road can take ya straight down to hell 
 Doing nothing here everyone straight trippin 
 Happy at times are gone past starts slippin 
 This will be enough to keep me on the road livin 
 Good every night in a different city Ill be sleepin

 Is she here Is she there Drinking Jack and cola 
 She says Tim where ya been I got somethin to show ya 
 Lola fired off her clothes and started rock and rollin 
 Tonight protect us from the stormWell I went south with a case of survival 
 To amend my heart thats paper thin 
 You see I felt her words and her images filed 
 Im gonna carry my heart to New Orleans 
 I have no home to go so I wander a while 
 From coast to coast from sin to sin 
 From the coldest shores to the warmest islands 
 Been around the world back to New Orleans 
 Well shes got pride like a million lions 
 Shes got a scar on her velvet face 
 Shes got a smile like a newborn child 
 Shes got a walk a stoic grace 
 I never slept that night until my arrival 
 I romanticized a long embrace 
 You see I lost my tongue and burned my Bible 
 But made it back home to New Orleans 
 Well I held my breath and I swam for miles 
 When all was lost and hell took place 
 You see it rained all night and the city she flooded 
 It rained all night in New Orleans 
 Yeah it rained all night in New OrleansRepeat 2x 
 Back down no back down comin up 
 Rise up no rise up showin up 
 Lock down no lock down comin up 
 International coverup 
 What about the state of the union 
 What about the guns theyre using 
 What about the kids that dont matter 
 What about a genaral strike 
 You dont know what its like 
 Whats its like what its like 
 Repeat 2x 
 What about the cage getting rattled 
 What about the international battle 
 What about the kids who are dreaming 
 What about the kid who got stopped 
 Whats its like what its likeMy life the blessing 
 Understand my aggression 
 I dont regret nothing 
 Its all been a lesson 
 Me and my friend got the music 
 Like a loaded gun were gonna use it 
 Tell us we aint shit I wont listen 
 Try to hit us but you keep on missing 
 I knew the sentence then 
 I knew it was gonna blow 
 Dont say I didnt warn you 
 Apocalypse radio 
 Sometimes Im a total wreck 
 I want to break someones neck 
 I get a subwoofer going 
 Four twelves get my blood stream going 
 Never saw it coming paid my price in time 
 Its been ten years or more with all the 
 Battle scars in my mind 
 Apocalypse radioSolidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 You said it was nothing I knew it was something 
 I was no surprisin I saw you cryin 
 About you  Said now what went wrong 
 About you  Said you cant go on 
 About you  Said it was a long time gone 
 About you  Now your lifes too long 
 Didnt see it comin your fears went hunting 
 9 millimeter stops you running 
 About you  Said the pressure on 
 About you  Now you cant go on 
 About you  Now youre long time gone 
 About you  So what went wrong 
 Bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun 
 Bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gunYoure making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 Youre making enemies 
 Don killed Anyas father 
 In a brutal sword fight 
 The old man regrouped 
 And came back from the dead 
 Well the old man came back from the dead 
 And dragged Don Giovanni to hell 
 So dont fuck with me kidFor 24 hours on the Ivory Coast 
 They release soldiers from their post 
 They dedicate champagne for a toast 
 They pay dividends to the countrys host 
 They said Tonight you can leave your home 
 But tomorrow but tomorrow its gonna be the way of the gun 
 And the curfew wont allw you to roam roam roam 
 And the bullets will let you know when the big dog comes round your door 
 Who is the killer 
 Wooooh oh oh 
 Stonecold killer 
 Woooooh oh oh 
 Food for the trigger 
 Woh oh oh 
 Ill shoot ya down right on sight 
 If youre out at the wrong time of night 
 And in a civil war theres no civil rights 
 In the dead of day run for your life 
 And tomorrow its gonna be the way of the gun 
 And the curfew wont let you roam roam roam 
 And the trenches are dug 
 And the bones aint too shiver 
 The tastes of war so cold and bitter 
 And the human race is the face of the killer 
 And the cost of life is rarely considered 
 Woh oh ohYeah 
 Theres something in the street tonight 
 Dont know what it is but it wont keep quiet 
 Breaking through your masses on your radio brodcaster 
 Theres something in the air tonight 
 And its turning in to a full fledged riot 
 Singin for a last dance  someone tryin to find the truth 
 Oh Nine Lives  Im gonna come right back for you 
 Theres something in the world today 
 Dont know what it is but it sure smells rotten 
 Babylons burning and the fire seems waterproof 
 Theres someone in your home tonight 
 You think you know who they are but something aint so right 
 I look a different way and boy they dont feel the same about me 
 And I run and I run and I ride and I ride 
 And I live and I live and I die and I die 
 And I know it was all for you and me x4Another lesson has been learned 
 In this days modern times 
 Strangers in the mist appear 
 Now theres war all the time 
 Systematically go and destroy 
 Commit another atrocity 
 Aggressors are in their places 
 Manmade catastrophe 
 Im not looking for a fight now 
 And I dont care whos wrong or right now 
 So release the dove into flight now 
 So we can start right now 
 We can start right now 
 A small keys gonna open the door 
 Across the border to a new land 
 And in the new land a sand storm roars 
 Under spell and the ghost of a man 
 A pack of men theyre yours to stay 
 Their prayers fall upon deaf ears 
 Machiavelli owns a machine gun now 
 And I see it in the mask and a puppeteer 
 Humanity has no blame in this case this big game of chess for us all 
 Hostility explodes in the mess now your arm got blood all over the wall 
 And clarity turns to dark blindfolding prisoners of war 
 And solidarity on the razors edge boy what Youre a big puncher now right 
 Yeah Ha Nah I dont fucking think so 
 Ha ha ha 
 We can start right nowOkay check this out 
 It aint impossible it aint easy 
 Opportunities shiftin here 
 So far the strategy aint workin 
 The facts are in its so very clear 
 I do what I want I cant predict the future 
 And those who can I know that they are lyin 
 And then the truth can be hard to swallow 
 In a soap opera world leaders are cryin 
 Correction I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin for direction 
 You can burn a book if you dont like the answers 
 Or join forces with an axe grind 
 USA protecting your cancers 
 A list of hatreds easy to find 
 And theres a growing sentiment in America 
 If you listen closely you can hear them all 
 Right is right wrong is wrong 
 And the evil considered bad behavior 
 Bad generations polarized view 
 No one leaves home to go and help you 
 Watch CNN and then you know 
 US bombs come down and whatcha gonna do 
 Boom boom boom look around 
 Theres no more roof no more house no street no town 
 All shot down burnt black and brown 
 Electrical meltdown you hear the sound 
 Of the US bombs all around 
 Oh its a shakedown its a breakdown 
 Atomic sundown 
 And then you know 
 One last timeYou took blood with the wrong crew 
 Now were through with you 
 You took blood with the wrong crew

 Kicking up a riot 
 Wont you all sing along

 So tired it was showing 
 Like the wind Im blowing 
 Every town man Im known in 
 Some live a life of indecision 
 Strung out in the petty schisms

 Punk rock is my religion

 Wont you all sing alongI aint worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking

 One million nights and all 
 The pain and struggle 
 All the rate and troubleIs it you

 Hey Hey Hey 
 American shopping malls 
 Where a product is sold and bought here 
 Euthanizing the public 
 While the dead walk the escalators 
 They come from the loudspeakers 
 They hear a subliminal message 
 An ad entices you the consumer 
 And theres no way to find it 
 Is this human freedom 
 Hedonistic excess 
 Junky consumerism 
 Massproduction toxic sickness 
 Everyone is wearing now 
 Plastic masks that they hide behind 
 Marketing massive sales of nothing 
 Everything is selling 
 The arrogance 
 Lost me with nonsense 
 Well its so aggressive 
 Yet so repulsive 
 Well its a noxious culture 
 Of the swarming vultures 
 And I see an imposter 
 And hes coming to get you 
 Is it you whos born frustrated1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 No one is safe here were all in danger 
 Through the corridor I see a stranger 
 Robbin and ransacking I see him walking 
 Lock your doors now I hear him knocking 
 Up to no good up to no good 
 Like a spark on a wire or a splinter in wood 
 Best intentions get misunderstood 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good x6 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 Quick like a snake hes good at stealing 
 Hell even steal the plaster off the ceiling 
 Cloaked in darkness I see him standing 
 Making moves in the night hes a ghost man 
 Criminals I understand them 
 Watch your back cause well come at random 
 Born to lose and you end up in the system 
 Hes our friend now were gonna miss him 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good x8 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Well I drank from Tahwehs songs and I dined on a devils tail 
 Well Im the best at selling Christ and Ill see you all in hell 
 Cause Im already dead 
 Well Ive been to hell and back one million times 
 And the hurricane came and water all the way to sounds 
 If God and Satan both held my hand 
 They said stay with us til you understand 
 Well my mother was a whore she was blind deaf and dumb 
 Well if you look at me across well youre gonna feel my gun 
 You see I lie cheat and steal and Ill break your fucking neck 
 And youll curse out my name when you take your last breath 
 Cause Im alBooks on Emerson 
 Books on Thoreau 
 But all I read was maps of the road 
 And I was three thousand miles away from you 
 All the while I was twentytwo 
 What do you do to know who you are 
 The best way for me to drop out on tour 
 You went to Upstate NxY New York to go to school 
 To secure the roll with your parents 
 I got a new perspective on you 
 All the good and bad that we went through 
 I know you better than you know you 
 Cause I got a new perspective on you 
 I never needed much I never liked to loom 
 But a gesture can get me from across the room 
 The first night we talked until while the sun caught up 
 Transparent people melting all around us 
 You left in a plane I left in a van 
 Played nightclub houseparties and auditoriums 
 Saw Germany England Italy with my band 
 I know you better than your new friends 
 Ford Econdlane September 93 
 Driving 10 hours until my eyes are blurry 
 3 packs of Winstons and a bag of seeds 
 Tapes of x and a thermos of coffee 
 6 weeks on and 10 days off 
 Then I go back on the road for another show 
 This is all that Ive ever done 
 Girl I got nothing to fall back on 
 But I got a new perspective on you 
 All of the good and bad that we went through 
 Cause I got a new perspective on youDont call me white Dont call me white 
 Dont call me white Dont call me white 
 The connotations wearing my nerves thin 
 Could it be semantics generating the mess were in 
 I understand that language breeds stereotype 
 But whats the explanation for the malice for the spite 
 I wasnt brought here I was born 
 Circumcised categorized allegiance sworn 
 Does this mean I have to take such shit 
 For being fairskinned No 
 I aint a part of no conspiracy 
 Im just youre average Joe 
 Represents everything I hate 
 The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind 
 The vast majority of sheep 
 A buttoned collar starched and bleached 
 Constricting veins the blood flow to the brain slows 
 Theyre so fuckin ordinary white 
 Were better off this way 
 Say what youre gonna say 
 So go ahead and label me 
 An asshole cause I can 
 Accept responsibility for what Ive done 
 But not for what I am 
 Dont call me white Dont call me whiteTheres a power in a union theres a power inside 
 Theres a power inside every man alive 
 Theres a power in a union theres a power inside 
 When I look into your empty pockets 
 The storm is nothing cause its already here 
 Look into an honest mans eyes now 
 Oh the only thing youre gonna see is fear 
 Know what its like to be alone now 
 What its like not to have a friend 
 Some make  get a foe now baby 
 But the unions gonna be here all the way to the end 
 Theres a power inside every man aliveShes a Salvador immigrant head through a thin wall 
 A frail hooker holding her carnal walls 
 Gleaming sky scraper bunker he looked down 
 Laugh hysterically and then he spread around 
 On Hoover Street then he must be alone 
 The precious little kid cashed the woes 
 Salvadorian girl she kind of made you spill 
 Her brother Mario got shot 4 times in da head 
 Now see poor Mario he caught a hot one 
 Through the lung now hes done so God bless the man 
 Cocaine moved through that system like a river forever winding 
 To the last party of the lower class 
 Even distance just a bunch of kids who dont wanna finish last 
 Now see the market place has changed the weight of the scale 
 You either get out and die or go to jail 
 And your best intentions splinter and frail 
 And a few weeks of promises and attempts to fail 
 Its a glasspipe murder 
 Glasspipe murder 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 They kick a bottle of beer and a letter 
 Simple things made Mario feel better 
 You see it falls on you and it falls on me 
 Selfannihilation catastrophe 
 Two packs of cigarettes 
 For two dollars and seventy cents and a 
 Bottle of wine thats been opened 
 And he said Why do I do this 
 A shiver through his body like a bottle of CC 
 Not encouraging reality or me 
 He said Its who I am baby back to it 
 Off the deep end the record changed 
 You see no one stood up and cheered for him 
 Everyone sat down with something that happened 
 Began to happen 
 Its an old school dorm mystery 
 And the handcuffs bleed 
 Who was the killer its in theYeah 
 13 red and white stripes flying White for skin and red for dying 
 Why cant I  walk on through And not feel like  one is in hell 
 We dont need no water let the motherfucker burn 
 Whoooo for dying 
 Ah is in hell 
 Why cant I  walk on through And not feel like  one is in hellDead bodies everywhere 
 Piles of blood entrails and hair 
 Im bleeding from the inside 
 From the armageddon outside 
 Disfigured and oblique 
 From the appetite that I seek 
 Im a hungry cannibal 
 Im a rabid animal 
 My remains are being scattered 
 Ive been bludgeoned Im in pain 
 Stomach pains are coming 
 And they strike with demon speed 
 Reaccuring rotting dreams 
 From this place the demons speak 
 My skin exfoliates 
 My patience terminates 
 Unfold to unholy urges 
 Unearthed with urgency 
 The holocaust was nothing 
 Compared to my lividity 
 In this oblong box thats eating you 
 Theres nothing you can doLittle sammy was a punkrocker 
 You know his mother never understand him 
 Went into his room and smashed his billy bragg record

 Without a care here you should just see there

 Government agency said be afraid of me

 Wolverine came through

 Neighborhood Watch said we gotta put a stop 
 Said we cant have people livin for free 
 Call the cops 
 Here come the SWAT team and the M16 
 Shoot the walls in 
 Destroy the building 
 Wolverine was sad and it made him mad 
 Every single cop got a bullet in their head 
 Fighting crime in the streets togetherDont ever take away from me my pornography 
 Obviously we dont agree on whats obscene 
 I have the right to choose what I want to see and read 
 Dont ever try to take away from me and my right to privacy 
 Because what I do is no ones business but me 
 So stay in your missionary position 
 I hope that you get bored to death 
 Theres no way in hell Im goin through life havin vanilla sex

 Detained in illegal custody spent the night in jail 
 With a drunken priest and a hooker 500 bail 
 Nobody knew who was who standing in the street like that 
 I hit the ground to make a sound 
 Bus dropped me off and I had to cough I couldnt breathe 
 Cause I got ripped off I couldnt realize by being satisfied cause it runs so thin 
 And thats why Im pissed off we had no money we had time

 I hear the voices but I cant make out their words 
 Saying things saying things that 
 I got something sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eye 
 I feel unusual from thinking 
 About the underground decay God help me 
 Kill beneath the camera watch the world begin to cry 
 Its not from pity it comes from 
 Whats been sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eyeWell they tell me theres a pie up in the sky 
 Waiting for me when I die 
 But between the day youre born and when you die 
 No one ever seems to hear you cry

 And then the harder they come 
 The harder they fall one and all Oh oh oh

 Harder they fall one and all Yeah yeah yeah 
 Break it down 
 Well I try to do the things that I want 
 Cause when youre dead you know that you cant

 Poisoned like a rat who drank some strychnine gin 
 How many men can say they been allow this to happen 
 Bureaucratic military federation

 And consequently nothing but a concrete jungle 
 And lord I wonder 
 Nickels diamonds cant be found

 Break down the fear 
 Helicopters coming down on me tonight 
 My brother selling cocaine he knows how to fight 
 Hounded and arrassed in a power elite bought 
 Sun aint arise so I abite by my route 
 I remember a cold December when I heard the revolution rock 
 Didnt hear what they were saying I ran through the mayhem of a police state on my block 
 Like a bombBlood on the situation 
 Blood on the street sometimes 
 Youre gonna hit the cold concrete 
 Ok lets go 
 Bloody Thursday was July 6th 
 The pigs killed 3 workers 
 Harry bridges grabbed the mic

 The media claimed the commies were taking over scapegoats write that some of its true 
 3 uncompromising strikes paved the way Minn Sf and Toledo 
 Blood on the situation

 Against the power raise your fist 
 Oppress the power that exists 
 Raise your fist raise your fist 
 Oh the power that exists 
 In the land of freedom I will make a claim 
 Forth rack on production politicians this is all insane 
 Heart of the heartland or they stream the blood 
 Where invisibly for one thousand and third 
 No alliance sure no cross to bear 
 No crack to follow no police to share 
 Apathetic revolution people go put to sleep 
 As the people are wake up theyll be rioting the streets 
 Oh the power that existsReconciliation in what they already knew 
 Humanities lost when the powers vested in a few 
 Spread out like a million locusts covering the sun 
 Protagonists and infidels gonna speak out on the run 
 Deep rooted back and forth failed from both sides 
 Triggered a sudden excitement into the battle night 
 Shadow of Robin Island cloud the symbol of change 
 Nelson spent 18 years on Robin Island estranged

 The night has come and we no longer see 
 Better days around the corner for you and me 
 Receive the horizon dawns golden glow 
 Lars 
 It takes courage to make it in this land 
 So dont forget but forgive every man 
 And prosperitys river it will forever flow 
 Honor is among us honor is all we knowOn the cusp of an explosion 
 I answer with evil thats the way that I play it 
 Street Turks multiple contusions 
 I gnash spit 
 I grind my teeth 
 Got a gun and a knife 
 Staring back at you 
 No security force or vigilantes 
 Overweight ego can dethrone me 
 Ostracized if not otherwise 
 Left to my own device youll surly see 
 Staring back at youOriginally by Sham 69

 This time the drugs are you 
 And theyll come through 
 It aint gonna stop till they get what they want 
 And I say 
 Nobody knows me Im all alone 
 Ah yayayayay I gotta go 
 Its a Hollywood bus stop and the partys over 
 John couldnt flag his homeboy down so he waited for a ride 
 Then waited to confide in Hollywoods concert backslide 
 With affordable lives and a sunroof nestled among the filth 
 Infrequencies and bad intentions gotta take it for what its worth 
 Have you ever been haunted by your past 
 And it will never let you go 
 Well never never let you go

 Im a hyena fighting for lion share 
 Sometimes the lions share aint there 
 Absent from political authority an animal Ive become 
 Total disorder and confusion is the lifestyle that I run 
 Permit me to do what I want and I will Im a nomad to travel 
 Concrete glass stone and gravel 
 Every time I turn around its the same sad story 
 Getting ganked I wish it could end and lifes commissary

 Who can I trust in a world of greed 
 When Im taught to take and not to give 
 Who can I trust when Im taught to take and not to give

 Punk rockers skinhead misfits and misunderstood kids

 There was romance in the air for sure 
 Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Youth was exhausted 
 Some take it harder then most 
 My best friend he crumbled and he withered away withered away 
 I went back to the palm trees 
 The safest place Ben could ever be 
 Mixed his ashes with the dirt 
 Hell be safe there Yeah 
 There was romance in the airHe was an artist and a writer 
 And a poet and a friend 
 In a mans life he will take a fall 
 But how low he goes it just depends 
 Hes shooting dope in the mens room 
 At the station Daly City Train 
 Have you ever seen an angel well I know I have 
 You see they stay here for a while then they fly away 
 Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him 
 When he rolled the dice you know he never thought twice 
 Never thought twice about being here 
 Some grow up and some grow old 
 But what about the kid who never learned the rules 
 Spent all these years on this earth 
 When you look back its just a flicker of time 
 Jackyl was one of the ones that perished 
 Yeah he was one of the ones that was already saved 
 Through all this evil and wreckage yeah 
 He maintained a sense of himself 
 Some men are in prison although they walk the streets at night 
 Other men who got the lockdown are free as a bird in flight 
 How about the hour in the system that ended 
 In a oneway line our measures could not stand it 
 Never thought twice about being hereJimmy said he could handle this 
 Oh hes from Los Angeles oh 
 Jimmy said he could handle this 
 Born and raised in West Los Angeles 
 Dads a lawyer Mummys asleep

 Another day of living she goes to confession 
 I know the Catholic girl was sinning 
 Sabrina Sabrina SabrinaNo God no truce 
 A fire from the sky rains brimstone from above 
 A whole world implosion got too close to the sun 
 A vein from a power struggle explode into a bloody mess 
 Rupturing the nations core blushing from the stress 
 The atheists get in line awaiting the coming destruction 
 Religious dogma corrupted and corrupter 
 With a man made of sin leads a full scale invasion 
 Drains the life from the skins abrasion 
 No restoring order in a full scale attack 
 Theres no fucking vision theres no voice its all black 
 Then you break down with a villainous call 
 Puss bleeding profusely from the city wallsAnother show with a fucked up promoter 
 Kids sent in by the media controller 
 They arrived in a 87 Ford with a gun rack 
 Case of Bud and stiletto blade 
 Its the kind of show you end up at 
 When you get stabbed by the blade 
 Big business made 
 I wanna go boot 
 I wanna go blade 
 The main controller tried to buy me out but I didnt buy it 
 Some people did and there is nothing I could do about it 
 Case of Bud and a stiletto blade 
 When you get stabed by the blade 
 The kids unloads his glock into the urban blight 
 Bullets sprayed the car as we drove into the night 
 We lived to tell the story and Im goona tell you

 The secret to a good life is knowing when youre through

 His mother cries she knows that he is strong enough to die 
 Hes rollin in the Cadillac its midnight sunroof is down 
 Three shots rung out the heros dead the new king is crowned 
 Ooh time bombA cat lies awake when it sleeps

 Win her to enlightenment and set her conscience free

 Whos been trained by a sick junkie 
 On a mission to get money 
 For a new suit and tie 
 To wear to a reception 
 Where they envy your deception 
 And give compliments and praises 
 To the ones they despite 
 Practicing your smile in the mirror all the while 
 Try to cultivate the style of the bastards in power 
 I know what theyre selling 
 Cause their nervous twitch is telling 
 Youre coming off smelling like the pig of the hour 
 I got a lot of people telling me Im outta my mind 
 And I dont know why 
 My brain was bleeding and my fingers were proceeding 
 Through a notebook I was keeping since the dawning of time 
 Senses were corroded 
 You know that I was loaded 
 You were dealing I was reeling 
 From the feeling and the madness was concealing 
 Its a siren song 
 People that I trusted would surely have me busted 
 If they ever had a clue what was really going on 
 I got a lot of people telling me Im out of my mind 
 And I dont know why I dont know why lets go 
 And I dont know why I dont know why lets goBusiness man come shake my hand 
 Show me numbers that I understand 
 Youre my candle Im your burnin wick 
 Two sides comin in quick 
 Say goodbye when you see me sign

 So many things to be seen 
 So many bands to be heard 
 Just for once can I be ignored 
 He back cool I say

 Together all over the world 
 Could not make it without you 
 Stranded stranded 
 Stranded all over again stranded all over again with you 
 Hangin out in The East Bay 
 With my friends and family for a week

 Train station gave my ticket got on the train 
 My only luggage was my old beat up guitar 
 Stranded all over again with youA Wild dog speeding 
 On the bastard sun 
 A downward situation 
 And it stinks like a bum 
 Class isnt over 
 Its just begun 
 So get up neighborhood 
 Neighborneighborhood Scum 
 Where kids 
 Get inside 
 I watch 
 Like a wolf 
 Like a hungry type 
 Apocalypse now 
 Static on the run 
 Its just 
  Alex  
 Something gotta 
 Come through 
 Murder garden 
 Here we go 
 And saying 
 Homeboy 
 Out on the corner 
 Well theres a tunnel 
 Underneath 
 Everything you see 
 That undermines 
 The Truth 
 Fighting  
 Its just  Alex 
 Watching shit 
 Breaking to 
 If hes destroying 
 Its no surprise 
 Its just deceit 
 Despair in a 
 Mad dogs eyes 
 I hope that 
 For a while 
 I stash 
 And not cause 
 Im right 
 And youre a 
 Portrait of a lamb 
 Service of the D 
 I find a refuge 
 In a cab 
 In the barren 
 Laid city 
 Hehe 
 Work it now 
 I say 
 The Truth 
 The TruthTrue to ourself glad we did it 
 Beat him down with a baseball bat 
 Police retreated the riot scenes 
 In fear of a baseballbat 
 Working class intellectuals 
 Disillusion you for sure 
 Broken dreams in Warsaw 
 Where all the dreams fall down 
 American baseball bat 
 Demolish the discoteque 
 And how many blows to his forearm and neck

 They said I got some rights and I really shouldnt knock it 
 What can we do x7 
 Broken bones broken rules 
 They can all be fixed oh yeah 
 So let those who battle with the pen 
 And the others with the fist its the gospel now 
 The strong ones will be defiant with words that can convince 
 You can take this as rules but Ill take it as a dis 
 Well they wanna hold me with wrongful suspicion 
 And Im all bundled up in an awkward position 
 And they say its all part of a hundred year tradition 
 And I do feel they got a mental condition

 Hey Marky Go get your fuckin shine boxLets go down town tell me what youre seeing 
 Tell me what its like to get that old cold feeling 
 Spend all night just looking at the ceiling 
 Living in a blown out hotel building 
 All the machines are broken down 
 Its a narrow path between evil and good 
 Watch the strong man in his decline 
 Another man dying is misunderstood 
 All I see is damnation 
 Whole worlds gone to hell 
 Dont see things the way they were 
 Only see things the way they are now 
 Realize now that its gone too far 
 Look into the eyes of the dead and gone 
 Now all the machines are broken down 
 Its a song and dance between evil and good 
 Early stages of final decline 
 All alone misunderstood 
 Whole worlds gone 
 Whole worlds gone to hellKick the kick drum increase the weight of the sound 
 The dialog of maximum decibles is enough to move the fucking ground 
 Im gonna amplify the rage of a class 
 Thats thought inferior the message in the volume 
 This songs a carrier 
 Unwritten rules 
 Rules understood 
 Boomin out the speakers and amps in the hood 
 I like to drink beer play music and go to shows

 Is anybody out there got a soul 
 Cause Im just looking for a girl 
 The girl with a heart of gold 
 She over turns once again count with her champagne case 
 She goes straight down the rathole with her 
 Total recklessness and 
 Tomorrow will come on through 
 And I got nothing but a sillouette girl 
 Met her in darkness 
 I said Im just looking for a girl 
 Yeah Im in the corner I start over

 Breakdown 
 BreakdownIn the army of Babylon Im a young Al Capone 
 My self an outlaw in the eyes of the Lord 
 Good man lose and the bad man win 
 The blind and the sick I attenuate them 
 Barrels of concrete and melted steel 
 Black smoke rises like a ghost in the field 
 Hardened lungs deep breathing the air 
 That stings the life from within me 
 Succobus catches on and it wont let me go 
 The leprosy sets in and you got no glue 
 The 3rd world working on the factory floor 
 Its so dark in there you cant see the sun no more 
 Cold and burnt are frostbitten hands 
 That leaves you like a flower thats been pulled from the sands 
 Rabid dogs chewing at my feet 
 Trying to protect their side of the street 
 Army of Babylon young Al Capone yeah 
 Young Al Capone yeah young Al Capone yeah 
 In the darkness among lonely spirits 
 Hopeless atmosphere steel gates spear it 
 So simplistic so realistic so sadistic 
 Yea you lose it all yea 
 Ok Tim take this one homeHey ho let the bombs blow 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I aint got control x2 
 No control of destiny 
 Wake me up to reality 
 I can just see anarchy 
 And there aint no telling 
 Whos in charge here 
 Hey ho let the bombs blow 
 Dead men they tell no tales 
 Satan finally broke out of Hell 
 And everybodys got something to sell 
 Cause there aint no good 
 That I can see here 
 People going crazy situation Code Red 
 And the whole worlds out of control 
 The walls and the fences are being torn down 
 And the bodies of the murdered are getting cold 
 Wild dogs gone mad 
 Smell the blood of their own kill 
 The weakest of the pack 
 Nothing is the way that it seems around here 
 Very clear its a very deadly trap 
 I aint got control x2I could not fit in 
 I was the one who got caught 
 I was the one who got realized 
 I was the one who got dropped 
 Shut out banished and locked away 
 The knife that did me in I was carry to this day 
 Rejected 
 Crossing the bridges in the land of the forgotten 
 Distrust existed that I never saw 
 Deep seated trust I was a victim of 
 Rejected 
 Unspoken among the more privileged or the so called 
 I was not good enough not good enough at all 
 At first out of lonliness I tried to conform 
 But all that bullshit just left me all alone 
 Left me all alone yeahPick me back up just to throw me back down 
 Apologies too late when youre up against the wall 
 Compassion heals while duplicity kills 
 You say that Im different you say that Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you 
 You moved up the ladder at very rapid speed 
 We moved methodically and calmly 
 When you got to the top you see enemies 
 If I knew back then what I know now 
 That it would all turn out like this 
 Id sit back and Id watch you squirm 
 Cause you say Im different you say Im different man 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about youRealize youre 
 Dehumanized you 
 Criticize your existence 
 Its your demise when no sun arise when youre 
 Paralyzed by your lack of resistance 
 She dont know who she is 
 She dont know where shes going 
 Down below where the fires glowing 
 Tenderloin Tenderloin Tenderloin 
 The tricks she gets them 
 Shes not a victim 
 She makes a list of them and reads them all alone 
 For money shes walking down on Larkin 
 In TI theyre rocking all night long 
 Tenderloin Tenderloin TenderloinEchoes of reggae 
 Comin through my bedroom wall 
 Havin a party up next door 
 But Im sittin here all alone 
 Two lovers in the bedroom 
 And the other starts to shout 
 All I got is this blank stare 
 And that dont carry no clout at all 
 Destination unknown 
 Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho 
 Hes singin and shes 
 There to lend a hand 
 Hes seen his name on the marquee 
 But she will never understand 
 Once again hes leavin and shes 
 There with a tear in her eye 
 Embraces with a warm gesture 
 Its time time to say goodbye 
 Rubys heart aint beatin 
 Cause she knows the feelin is gone 
 Shes not the only one 
 Who knew theres somethin wrong 
 Her lovers in the distance 
 As she wipes a tear from her eye 
 Rubys fading out she disappears 
 Ruby ruby ruby ruby sohoCrime epidemic  Never going down

 System systematic  Survival in the town 
 Only if you let it  Gonna drag you down 
 Evils my friend

 Youre never gonna let em  take away your right 
 And the bad ones forget them  Running to the night 
 And the good ones regret them  Ready to ignite 
 Evils my friend againThe common man doesnt suffer pain like this 
 Only the sort that has never been kissed 
 Let us adore our beautiful son 
 Hes ridin on the rivers of Babylon 
 Burnin up shootin up bring on the brightness 
 See the son of god is comin up and there is a likeness 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin 
 When youre brought up youre caught up in a system thats goin 
 No one answers no one takes that call from you 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is 
 What do what do what do what do I desire 
 Some parents house is on fire 
 Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground 
 The neighborhood will watch without a sound 
 Will someone be a witness please tell me that hes crazy 
 But hes not and they know that and they cant get him cause hes not crazy 
 Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority 
 Hit em ship em club em submitted conformity 
 My hand went blind 
 You were in the vein clairvoyant 
 I make love to my transistor my transistor 
 And my transparency from the balcony 
 I looked out on the big field on the big field 
 It opens like the cover of an old bible 
 And out come the wolves out come the wolves 
 Their paws trampling in the snow the alphabet 
 I stand on my head and watch it all go away 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin when 
 Youre brought up and caught up in a system that is goinEverybody wants to come now but no one wants to pay 
 I like to show em but they do anyway 
 I was knocked down to my knees 
 Same thing for my  
 Gunshot Gunshot Gunshot in my heart 
 Sometimes there are guys I can deal with 
 Everythings imperative but I dont fucking 
 I know where you are but I never know or care 
 Ive got ideas but no decision 
 Gunshoooooot 
 Gunshot Gunshot Gunshot in my heartI want to go where the action is 
 I want to fly through the urban blight 
 I want to live like a shadow in the dark 
 And only move at night 
 A story bought a one story house that 
 Lets the winter bleed 
 21 years old and no money to read 
 How did she know the roof would cave in 
 Beat up bruised a record thats broken 
 Adinas crying again 
 Beat up chevy with a trailer in town 
 Is what they call home now 
 One more hill or river to cross on 
 On the way to another town 
 Crying in her beer and always running away 
 May be not so much running but hopin 
 For better days 
 Repeat 4x 
 Hey Hey 
 Shes crying againEvery city got an artery where the blood breaks down 
 An avenue or a boulevard and a boy who wears a crown 
 Indigant live styles mplies simply lack of means 
 Dogmatical authoritarians dictate the cities remains 
 A promise 
 To go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on me 
 When the factory shut down so did the place he lived 
 Blood money for junk bonds by a white collar fugitive 
 All the tax free insentives aint goin to help him now 
 Generations of job security gone out like the horse and plow 
 To go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 My old man worked his troubled life in a nowhere dead end 
 He drank the pain away Ill be damned if thats me having my dreams robbed 
 The working class carries a country that has been rotting inside for years 
 The rigs cuffed my old man in the front yard I saw through my eyes of tears 
 A promise to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on meNo woman no cry 
 No woman no cry 
 No woman no cry 
 Said  said  said I remember when we used to sit 
 In the government yard in Trenchtown 
 Oba  obaserving the hypocrites 
 As they would mingle with the good people we meet 
 Good friends we have oh good friends weve lost 
 Along the way yeah 
 In this great future you cant forget your past 
 So dry your tears I seh yeah 
 Ere little darlin dont shed no tears 
 Said  said  said I remember whena we used to sit 
 And then Georgie would make the fire lights 
 As it was logwood burnin through the nights 
 Then we would cook cornmeal porridge 
 Of which Ill share with you 
 My feet is my only carriage 
 So Ive got to push on through 
 But while Im gone I mean 
 Everythings gonna be all right 
 I said everythings gonna be all righta 
 Everythings gonna be all right now 
 So woman no cry 
 No  no woman  woman no cry 
 Woman little sister dont shed no tears

 When no more machine guns striking and theres silence instead 
 Yeah like a lion1951 small town kids got nothing to do 
 But dream all night of movie stars and Cadillac cars 
 And beautiful girls and big city lights 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 From every corner of this great old nation 
 Good kids succumb to the depths of temptation 
 Homecoming queens get lost in the cracks 
 And quarterback heroes get strung out on smack 
 You wake up one day with a monkey on your back 
 With foil on all your windows and youre hiding all your tracks 
 The sheriffs shotgun dont make a sound 
 When its pointed at your corpse after he shot you down 
 LA River dragnet coming downYou said protect me 
 And you left me 
 On Christmas Eve

 Words dont apply on my push it up stereo 
 Transistor party but the faders right

 Whoo 
 Sham 69 roots reggae on my temple 
 With a 45 record too on the turntable 
 With the turntable kicking man it took away yeah 
 When the sun come a rising and let the song begins 
 Singing 
 Were on a mission got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour collision course 
 Lars 
 With the glow of the light on my radio dial 
 For better beats from the record file 
 I dropped the needle watching creetons drop 
 While Im playing Pacman at the record shop 
 Deep in the night and the chaos comes 
 My rhythm gets driven by the beat of drums 
 45 33 RPM 
 Hey Mr DJ let us in 
 Tim 
 Check it 
 One hundred miles an hour 
 One hundred miles an hour collision courseCar lights flash my eyes 
 Blinded hypnotized 
 Lord knows Im living and Im never coming back 
 Now one generation dies next one wins the prize 
 And thats the big surprise 
 Theres demise in all of their lies 
 Its never too late to realize 
 Thats just the way things are 
 Thats just the way it is now x2 
 I walk through the cemetery its all empty 
 Now I put a rose on the grave of a fallen hero 
 And I look out into the wild 
 All I see is emptiness so much loneliness 
 I just want forgiveness 
 When dreams fade away it wont be long 
 End up singing the same old song 
 What went right what went wrong 
 Bad times here good times gone 
 First rule  they always sell 
 Second rule  never tell 
 Third rule  straight to hell 
 White collar criminals living in jail 
 Its all that they gave 
 Sold your soul to get paid 
 But you end up in an early grave 
 Your own neck you cant save 
 Its a letter that you cant send 
 Its a wound that will never mend 
 Pain level peaks at ten 
 Some stand out some stand in 
 Thats just the way it is now x2This is where the good times went 
 With his brains lying on the pavement 
 With a broken bottle in his hand 
 And another in his back 
 Do you feel all right Oi Oi Oi 
 Someones gonna die tonight 
 Oi Oi Oi 
 The boys are out tonight 
 Was it something that he said 
 With his footballscarf now stained red 
 You will never understand 
 The boys are out tonightAlways outnumbered never outgunned

 What a depression 
 Upon this land 
 Everywhere youre going 
 People they all suffer 
 Everybodys suffering 
 Let me go home 
 Upon this landThe phenomena you are about to witness 
 Could well revolutionize your way of thinking 
 We are presenting startling facts and evidence 
 That take up where explanations leave off 
 Some of these revelations will very well go against things you have been taught 
 And perhaps believed all your life 
 Prepare yourself for the evidence that will followLulu 
 Ah ah ah ah ah 
 Lulu 
 Where the middle class breaks up 
 The working class better wake up 
 When America was dreaming 
 Some pigs stole our country 
 Lulu stands by her family 
 With harmony and history 
 Theres two kinds of stories 
 Either comedy or tragedy 
 Lulu works all day long 
 She goes 9 to 5 just to stay alive 
 Shell do anything just to walk the line 
 Aint no time to wine and dine 
 Her war time now in the USA 
 Her husband goes far away 
 Afghanistan to Iraq 
 Her husband now aint comin back 
 America the beautiful 
 Thats what the sign said 
 And I welcome every single one 
 Cause I want them all to stay 
 And Ill travel and Ill travel 
 Til my very last day 
 Through the New York harbor 
 To the San Francisco bay 
 Lulu Lulu Lulu LuluThats not clear whats this for where or when was the liquor store 
 Stuck it in some fucked up kid stayin here and not musclin 
 I seem to spray paint jet spray on the brick wall 
 An I always remember how he said Lonely no More 
 I say Thats only entertainment 
 Sometimes you need something need to turn it off 
 I went to college Im no proper knowledge 
 Ive seen the spray paint jet spray on the brick wall 
 Ill always remember how he said Lonely no more 
 Said liquor stores fucked the American prices 
 I said time never stopped stopped in front of me 
 He shared three pieces of wisdom 
 Ill always remember how he said 
 Lonely no more 
 I said Thats only entertainment 
 I say Thats only entertainment dopeThis place is a tale of terror 
 This place is a ghost town now 
 This place has lost its people 
 This place has lost its charm 
 The coals on the fire aint burnin no more 
 In the lake shore foundries 
 The workers misled by corporations 
 That knows no boundaries 
 This place is a tale of terror 
 The land of liberty has been betrayed by 
 The monster corporations 
 The monster wont stop til 
 It lays waste to everything 
 This place 
 This placeKristine with the wild grin in the future with the world to end 
 Youll leave my heart broken then one thousand times again 
 Kristine with the wild grin in the future with the world to end 
 The cops will come out when the sun goes down 
 From dawn to dusk while we give up the town 
 With the closest walk they dont make a sound 
 Got the baddest of the bad arent coming around 
 The street is wicked and its wild and its free 
  Fucker heresy 
 You dont hit the top man where you want to be 
 Its a long way to go and its a one way street 
 You aint got nothing when you born to lose 
 Your heart filled up with the filth and the booze 
 Standing on the street corner singing the blues 
 The end of the world is the popular tune 
 The citys hot but you cooled it off 
 The city block is another war zone 
 The city kids aint got no home 
 Hit me a brick and well all get stoned 
 In the streets youre never alone 
 In the streets youre never aloneHold your head up high 
 Cause tomorrow you may die 
 Cause no ones safe around here 
 No ones safe around here 
 Stand your ground 
 Till youre the last one in town 
 Someone that you trust turned out to be a tricker 
 Smoking cigarettes getting stoned on liquor 
 Getting really dizzy only getting sicker 
 Small problems now only seem bigger 
 Americas a safe place 
 If youre gonna leave it 
 And the rhetoric is there 
 If youre gonna read it 
 And the hollow masses 
 The machines defeated 
 And the rich look down to arrive on the bleeding 
 Hold your head up high 
 Hardly enough 
 It gets tough when youre running 
 So you bust out the homeless 
 When they start coming 
 In LA Broadway its wicked when theyre watching 
 And your backup and your backup and your backup aint working 
 Theres no food so youre spurred into action 
 Set up and go to no satisfaction 
 Ice and snow is the city passion 
 When you walk in the shadows girl theres no protection 
 Cause theres no one safe around here 
 Skin head Rob 
 OK well 
 This is the city of Los Angeles 
 And it never sleeps 
 It may look like it 
 But it doesnt 
 It lives and breathes nocturnally 
 So when youve got no place to sleep at night 
 And youre all huddled up 
 And youre cold 
 Well this song goes out to the citys forgotten 
 Hey Tim take us on home 
 Underlying reason well she cant keep it going 
 In the middle of the night 
 They found her frozen 
 And the WalMart sign 
 Keeps on glowing 
 And the winds of change keep on blowing 
 Till youre the last one in townReconciled to the belief consumed in sacred ground for me 
 There wasnt always a place to go 
 But there was always an urge a need to belong 
 All these bands and all these people 
 All these friends and we were equals but 
 Whatcha gonna do when everybody goes on without you 
 To the end to the end Ill journey to the end 
 To the end yeah 
 Started in 87 ended in 89 
 You got a garage or an amp well play anytime 
 It was just the 4 of us yea man the core of us 
 Too much attention unavoidably destroyed us 
 Four kids on tour 3000 miles 
 In a four door car not knowing what was going on 
 Not if we got a billion years it would turn out like this 
 Hell no no premonition could have seen this 
 Matty came from far away 
 From New Orleans then into the East Bay 
 He said this is a mecca 
 I said this aint no mecca man this place is fucked 
 Three months go by he had no home 
 He had no food hes all alone 
 Matty said fool me once shame on you 
 He said fool me twice he went back to New Orleans 
 To the end to the end Ill journey to the endI figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You didnt see us comin now theres nothin you can do 
 Times are gonna change change or step aside 
 Its my point of view that took you by surprise 
 The suns comin up yeah the new dawn arrives 
 New generation standing stand with anger in their eyes 
 No love in the city cause theres no connection 
 Been stricken with disease a racial infection 
 Im a battering ram comin through to you 
 In every alleyway on every avenue 
 Actions could erase all the fear that we suffer 
 People segregated no one understands each other 
 Hes a different color but were the same kid 
 I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his 
 Well an eye for an eye yeah a tooth for a tooth 
 Brother against brother should be singin with the group 
 The inner cities burnin yeah its screamin black and blue 
 The power and the passion of a million youth 
 I figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You dint see us comin now theres nothin you can do 
 All the blood that spills of all the guts that fly 
 The media paints a picture that stands 
 Pits dogs against cats now who is responsible 
 The power in the issue 
 The force is unstoppableI went to Mary 
 Far to too long 
 Jubilee was cold as fuck 
 Why do they make it that cold 
 Stand aside while she 
 Picked me for you 
 For the time you gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 I seen you finish 
 I saw you at the start 
 I remember you straight from my heart 
 Youd ask me and Id say Whatd you say 
 You gave me your heart and then youre taking it 
 You gave it awayWho wouldve thought that dreams come true 
 Who wouldve thought Id end up with you 
 Who wouldve thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming through 
 Sihlouettes of palm trees backing up against the sky 
 Echo park sunset an ambulance drives by 
 Someone went down and I wonder who 
 Faces fall through was it anybody I knew 
 So I drank like a fish till I crawl like a rat 
 In the city of shit I ended up on my back 
 But I cant believe youre with me after dark 
 So let it come together in echo park 
 Who wouldve thought that dreams come true 
 A red flag and your body wins 
 Or a snake bite gotta start again 
 So Im fucked up and watching TV all day 
 I dont wanna see what ricky lakes gotta say 
 And it hits me when Im alone Im an angry man 
 I start singing to myself I got dealt a shitty hand 
 With all these feelings my heart could explode 
 So is it not fear no not at all 
 And I said 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming throughGo 
 Ahahah 
 East Timor 
 Got two they want to set examples down below 
 Emperors gonna use some of that thought control 
 And I can hear the voices 
 Propaganda clogging generations choices 
 Malicious productions of evil on high 
 Frustrates Timors breath

 A misguided hated measure 
 Against a backdrop of wartorn weather 
 Whispering

 Burmas bloody crackdown killing many in the hate 
 Peaceful Buddhist monks soldiers in the hunt 
 Left the bodies in the jungle to be eaten by the lake 
 Oil and Opium 
 The poor have been beaten upside down 
 Bullets are applied to the people who arise 
 Burning stinging tear gas hits you right between the eyes 
 Soldiers locked and loaded this countrys been exploited 
 Raid the monasteries and silence the debate 
 The poor have been beaten upside downYeah yeah 
 The ladies on the corner selling extacy 
 Theyre dressed in fancy get ups like in porno magazines 
 Minors in the disco takes his first drink 
 Cops on the lawn waitin for the kids to leave

 East Bay night 
 When the sun goes down and the night come around 
 And the fog come arolling in 
 When you cast a line to go dance one time 
 And an old friend invites you in 
 Hear a punk rock song and we sing along 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Another East Bay night 
 Well Granma stands on the very same land 
 On the old house up on the hill 
 You can see the San Francisco Bay Alcatraz Albany landfill 
 And reminisce on the front porch under a yellow light 
 Earthquakes shake and fires take from this view 
 Ive seen it all Ive tasted smoke as the hills burned 
 I heard the freeway fall when theres nothing to say 
 Just look into the bay 
 You know some things they just feel right 
 East Bay nightShe gonna go 
 She gonna seek and destroy 
 She gonna split 
 With the whole damn scene 
 Make a run cause some rebellion 
 Hustle some cash with the danger eyes

 Shes got the danger eye 
 Well an eminent threat boy loose in the corner

 Scandalous victorious is no longer  
 Odds are only to her dismay 
 Raise up  
 She gonna go 
  Its a whole new night 
 She had a dream of a 60 foot devil dancing 
 Saw a blue sky open hands 
 Some got guns he used life as a weapon 
 Another twilight on the very next  
 An explosive frown  
 That it definitely holds you hostage 
 While death he comes so primitive 
 Shes got the dangerous eyesI saw  a new generationcoming 
 Under  the smoke over Oakland 
 In and out  the streets are breathing 
 Chaos disorder looting and loiter 
 From a blind man praying for some silence  for some silence 
 Take a loot on the moon not a foot in the room 
 My best intentions always ended in a fight  in a fight 
 You can send me to hell expose me Ill tell 
 Just take control and say what theyre doing  what theyre doing 
 Twofifty dead the tribune read Oaklands going off like a bomb 
 I saw  a new generation coming 
 Armageddon is coming so yeah you better start running 
 Cause the big wave is coming to the shore  to the shore 
 No surprise that you see through the lies 
 Of a system rotten to the core  to the core 
 High tech surveillance paranoia and violence 
 Keeping the city at a calm  at a calm 
 Man it just dont seem right 
 You see every time I turn I around its just the same story and its like 
 It just dont seem right and I wonder is it gonna endHit it 
 Knocking down the doors slogans on the walls 
 One said fight back yeah the system will falL 
 The police came out with tear gas and flames 
 Chaos in the city beating them at the game 
 Dont pay the poll tax the headlines read 
 Thirty cops beaten another one dead 
 The fight lasted on through the Brixton night 
 A thousand angry looters who knew they were right 
 Under  the smoke over OaklandLady Liberty come down and bleed for me 
 I want nothing to do with your crazy world 
 Broken promises so full of nonsense 
 Are blanketed by the time 
 I was all abandoned and alone 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanista 
 Lady Liberty come down and bleed on me 
 You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold 
 Some tenderness then the cold hits 
 And then I come to find that the streets arent paved at all 
 From the Kremlin to Afghanistan to our forgotten homes 
 The orphans in confusion to discharged refugees 
 In the fields of poison ivy through the famine and disease 
 You bled my loyalty 
 Lady Liberty come down and bleed for me 
 Oh youre telling me not to worry About the shortcomes of lies 
 And the high cost of living 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanistaHey hey hey hey

 Nihilistic feelings are movin

 To get outta here and 
 Make a life for herself

 In the dugouts it was 
 Cold damp and dark 
 And no one knew why 
 She wouldnt wake up 
 I think she finally 
 Made it back home

 Upon your back 
 From a knuckle duster 
 Made of gold 
 If you do the job 
 Loyal to the mob 
 Youll be sorted 
 And rewarded 
 Sold to France 
 In the sun 
 Well if you pay youre debt you wont regret 
 Please take me up on my advice 
 Cause vengeance will be delivered door to door 
 And right on time 
 Cuban cigars 
 Silver Jaguars 
 Brand new suits 
 All filled with loot 
 Hes looking wicked 
 And astute 
 Make no bonds he says 
 Villains lend their ears 
 Hes a legend 
 In the underworld 
 Of Londons war 
 Criminals wil be suckers 
 Listen up all you skinheads 
 Sewer rats 
 Gangsters 
 Villains and whores 
 The dark figures from the shadows 
 Crept up from behind 
 Well they brandished a gun 
 And pointed it directly at his face 
 And they shuddered at the sight 
 When the words were spoken 
 Go ahead son but youre making a 
 Big mistake 
 When the coolness of the night 
 Reflected off the cobblestone roads 
 And silence took over 
 He said 
 Do you know who the fuck I am 
 David CourtneyGo 
 Go 
 Walk into the party didnt know who you are 
 Said quick quick on the living room floor 
 All I know is about three fucking chords 
 Drumkit bass and electric guitar 
 Were headed out to another show 
 Dont know which way its gonna go 
 Dont even think about it 
 Dont even care 
 When the roadblocks in the way were gonna run around it 
 When the stop signs in the way were gonna run through it all right 
 All right 
 When all the punks come out tonight 
 Go to work go to school get a fucking job 
 Sit at home like a fucking slob 
 I prowl the street like Im the fucking law 
 All too crazy tripped and crawl 
 Depression cant cut me out of the music 
 So I choose it 
 I use it 
 I wont fucking lose it 
 Were not fucking around 
 Were not fucking around 
 Tonight 
 TonightClimb in 
 Better hurry up its getting harder to come backCheck this out 
 War between races war between lies 
 War between something that lays out deep inside 
 The deadliest one come blazin and identified 
 Yeah How many must lay before we realize 
 And I say How many must lay before we realize 
 I caught I caught 
 A glimpse I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 I was jolted I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 One that stops and launches and explosion 
 I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 It falls on you and then it it falls on me 
 Outside the church the streets are wet 
 Its a half past three 
 Well ya ya get your moves all steady 
 Cause no good is up again 
 Mortally wounded the one on the front seat 
 Its the beginning of the end 
 And ah 
 God bless the dead and the family and friends 
 I caught a glimpse of things to comeWithin the same school The idea was that wed later combine both styles 
 Unify the techniques 
 But still we were too young 
 Too full of ignorant pride in our own succulent sorrow 
 Oh no 
 Some people live illegal 
 What you got you cant keep here 
 All their lives are led in evil  Oh they rise a lot of evil  
 Open the jails and set the men free 
 Well the devils and witches are looming on me 
 And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery 
 A decision of descention into insanity 
 Humility will hold you and never let you go 
 To all my friends well much gratitude 
 And to all the wicked Ive got my eyes on you 
 And everyone stands in confusion 
 To do the job youve got to prepare yourself to die die die 
 Put em up put em in run em out run quicker 
 Cool to the breath and quicker than liquor 
 Quicker than any motherfucker that I know 
 Rack em up and stomp em wherever hell go 
 Rancid pack Im a blast it 
 Blasted lyrics of elastic 
 With a 12 gauge double barrel lyric gun 
 Go go  go 
 Reconcile with the culturalist 
 Proclamation to the nihilist 
 Down to the propagandist 
 Take me off of that fucking list 
 A decision of dissension into insanity 
 Go go go 
 All their lives are led in evil  Oh they rise a lot of evil Shes my gogo baby 
 Shes my honky tonk girl 
 She dances on my table 
 She dances on a pole 
 Some citys born some cities burn 
 Some cities die some cities Learn 
 Some cities take the worst of the turn 
 And if it aint your business 
 Then its not your concern 
 Listen brick buildings 
 Broken windows smoke stacks 
 Tell me somethings broken 
 And theres blood tracks 
 And if you see the train coming 
 Youre gonna relax 
 So tell the facts maam only the facts 
 Stand down what you gonna do 
 Shes a wild one 
 Im a wild one too 
 Shes my gogo baby 
 She dances on a pole x2 
 Midnight and Im rolling on 
 Nobody sees me coming home 
 And out here man a lot of things can go wrong 
 Shhh listen to my song 
 The morgue is busy day after day 
 Stick it on the line and throw it away 
 And if you see it coming on then you got it made 
 And the grave diggers laugh as they rot and decay 
 Say it loud 
 What you gonna do 
 And Im a wild one too 
 Im a wild one 
 Im a wild oneTheres a place where 
 Where I like to go 
 When I got no food 
 Or I got no shelter 
 Its a house where I can 
 Get away for maybe three days 
 To get off the drink 
 And stay off the haze 
 Whos the opposition 
 Im seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah Im down down down 
 Woke up in the bushes 
 630 Tuesday morning 
 With a unopened Heineken 
 And a head that was burning 
 For seven years I walked 
 Down the same path 
 Dreams of being loved 
 Was all I ever had 
 Lets go 
 Down on Fifth Avenue 
 Kids smoking crack and drinking 
 They say I dont belong here 
 Fuck you Mohican 
 They call me a faggot 
 And they shove me out 
 But I dont give a fuck 
 I never did 
 BlahHangin out with Lars down on 6th Street 
 He knew I was in trouble 
 I was feeling much like the devil 
 There was something burnin deep inside of me 
 Ran into three Puerto Ricans 
 These girls took us to the funhouse 
 Where we played a lonely pinball machine 
 Hangin on the corner of 52nd and Broadway 
 Cars passin by but none of them seem to be goin my way 
 New York City  well I wish I was on a highway 
 Back to Olympia 
 Im having a hard time understanding 
 It gets all too demanding 
 Shes all gone and Im stranded 
 Something burning deep inside of me 
 All I know its 4oclock and 
 She aint never showed up 
 And I watched a thousand people go home from work 
 How many times will it take me 
 Before I go crazy 
 Before I lose everything 
 Those girls took us to the funhouse 
 I dont wanna be alone again 
 Cars passin by but none of them seem to go my way 
 New York City well I wish I was on the highway 
 Back to OlympiaYeah Are you ready for this I told you he was coming GO 
 These bands call anywhere living in 66 
 I made so many mistakes when I look back it makes me sick 
 Those days are dead and gone and they aint ever coming back 
 I realize that in life it aint free 
 I got so many troubles it brings me to my knees 
 Those days are dead and gone and they aint ever coming back1987 at a 711 
 Police out looking for problems 
 But Im no average hoodlum 
 Still running from the pigs 
 So it seems to me this is not 
 The land of love and liberty 
 Its more like a waiting room in hell 
 Drink a qwart and watch me dwell 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonight 
 Glass towers rise above the filth and the pain 
 Im a moral degenerate feel my pain 
 Pass out in a squat on mission 
 That night I was shocked into submission 
 Straight down straight down to hell I head 
 Systems of sewers is where I lay my head 
 People on their way are like on a different dimension 
 I need no correction 
 Some of my friends moved on a simple domestic life 
 They磖e all gone only a few of us remain 
 Only few of us want to keep in the same 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonightThe way that she moves 
 Well I was aroused impowered impassioned by every move 
 Its so cold outside we need a place to hide 
 Go into the club to thaw out for the night 
 Shes automatic so automatic 
 The way that she moves the way that she moves 
 The way she moves 
 The situation was tricky I was feeling so proud 
 The bass and the drums the music so loud 
 She asked me if I would stand by her side 
 And I knew that I would till the end of the night 
 My head was spinnin a million miles an hour 
 The chance I was takin I get anxious around her 
 She put her head on my shoulder I started to hold her 
 Swingin and swayin the morning began 
 I say the way she moves yeah 
 I say the way she movesShes got her ticket  shes waitin at the station 
 Shes got to get away get away as far as she can 
 Her problems will arise as sure as the sun does shine 
 Shes got to get used to living on the lam 
 Now Marys out the door with a loaded 44 in her hand 
 Shootin down the law that shot down her dear departed man 
 When I last saw her she was lookin troubled 
 She said this is the 90s Im gonna be alright 
 She took the Greyhound into Salinas 
 I got a letter then she dropped out of sight 
 Shrouded in anger 
 Encompassed by pain 
 He was your best friend  youll never ever ever see him again 
 Now Marys out the door with a loaded 44 in her handOn the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 Its the lonely asshole with a glimmer of life 
 With the kill all the life 
 Killer dont care 
 Kill were not going 
 Destroying anywhere 
 Kill the lights kill the lights 
 Im gonna breakout Im gonna throw down 
 Cause I already hate you 
 Its just gonna drag me down 
 On the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 BlahIn the dark with the okland skyline 
 As I cross the city I avoid the landlines 
 All I wanna do is make it through without dying 
 All I wanna do is keep on trying 
 Another night 
 In the streets for me 
 No sanctuary 
 Come and watch me bleed 
 She wouldnt move until the coast was clear 
 She always knew the final battle was near 
 If you have a bag of dope she give it up for free 
 If you got a song of hope it will help her see 
 In the streets for mePick me back up just to throw me back down apoogies too like when youre up 
 Against the wall compassion heals while duplicity kills you say Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you You moved up the ladder 
 At a very rapid speed we mived methodically and calmly when you got to the top 
 You see enemies if I knew back then what I know that it would all turn out 
 Like this Id sit back and Id watch you squirm cause you say Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about youGo to work go to scool 
 Get an education so you wont be a fool 
 Get a doctorate PhD 
 All that shit is not for me 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life live it my own way 
 Was so blind I couldnt see 
 Figures of authority 
 Always standing behind me 
 Ready to come down on me 
 This is my life live it my own wayNever fell in love til I fell in love with you 
 Never knew what a good time was til I had a good time with you 
 If you wanna get the feelin  you wanna get it right 
 Then the musics gotta be loud 
 For when the music hits I feel no pain at all 
 Ya know 
 One summer night I was drinkin with my dad 
 He tried to give me love that I never had 
 But he gave more love to his bottle of wine 
 So I had to go out and find love of another kind 
 Here it is 
 Here I am 
 Turn it up fuckin loud 
 Radio radio radio radio radio radio radio 
 When I got the music I got a place to go 
 Radio clash magnificent 7 
 I was a choir boy you showed me no heaven 
 Two tools surely lost 
 No remorse ignoring the cost 
 Doncha know 
 Well I got a place well I got a place well I got a place to go 
 When I got the music I got a place to goLike Chaucers 
 Canterbury Tales 
 When three men find a pot of gold 
 And end up killing one another in the name of greed 
 Some people are poison 
 Under my skin like opium 
 Ill stare in their eye to annoy them 
 Well theyre poison yeah theyre poison 
 Admissions of liabilities 
 Im livin in my own private cold war 
 In a room full of spies 
 And I cant find the door 
 The violent aspects of the tattered man 
 Let me respond to that if I can 
 Illuminated manuscripts written by hand 
 Accusations have been made from the very beginning 
 Yeah their fuckin poisonYeah 
 Heres the new face of rocknroll 
 Its about fightin toe to toe 
 Hard times come 
 Yeah the hard times go 
 When I say come one come all 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 One mans decision 
 Brings anothers opposition 
 Completely unbound 
 Down on the flats 
 Where the seaside meets 
 My lonely young town 
 Well all the rudies and skins 
 Well theyre out on the streets 
 Making the way on the grill 
 Between the bottles and sex 
 They smash and they wreck 
 For something to live 
 Sometimes you know theres no place to go 
 But to a long life of crime 
 Yeah but its so wrong to steal 
 Someones very last meal 
 To profit up a dime 
 Your poe poes and greys 
 Well they end up in jail 
 Gonna swing the cowboys 
 Well you took a bite 
 Outta the apple of decision 
 That got ya there boy 
 Hooligans and rudeboys 
 I dont want no racial hatred 
 Black and white who are portrayed without bias 
 These are the people whose voice I want to be 
 I said the hooligans 
 Rancid 
 Rudeboys 
 Hooligans 
 Rancid 
 Ah ah ahHe didnt see it comin until it was too late 
 He had a bad feelin cant hesitate 
 And at the end of the day he was so tired 
 And he looked at the television 
 And whose the fuckin liar 
 He hates society he thinks its to big 
 Its just about killin a man with his ring 
 And he knew what was happening millions in gold 
 Hes the first on the case and theres a murder to shoot 
 Bright lights here comes the night 
 Interrogate the kid with the 357 
 Im gonna  Im gonna blast em 
 Question the ethics right or wrong 
 Secret identity started so young 
 He never made friends ah dont get too close 
 For a man whos got nothin hes just got the mercy 
 His family never knows the truth 
 Cause he gets caught when he tells the truth 
 No friends to lose or time to betray 
 The rendition from the papers gonna bake him again 
 See through his eyes his eyes alone 
 Intensified anger cant be controlled 
 He turned his indiscretion he brought it all down 
 If there was ever force of reason it could never be found 
 The timing was perfect this kid he was cleared 
 Computers down hes clasped his fear 
 A different mind lives in a way 
 Its a good good thing that he got it straight 
 Im gonna  Im gonna blast emBroke dough dope the line is choked 
 Smoked the last dollar to her name 
 Are you buying 
 Are you selling girl 
 Talking square never change 
 And if I really wanna know 
 What it means for her to be free 
 Oh shes mixing cocktails 
 In a squat down Avenue C 
 Lord have mercy 
 The parasitic clean on the most list easy 
 Ah dont give her a fight 
 The ditch is shallow so I know 
 There wont be no fucking rainbow inside 
 And they deny allegations so strenuously 
 Oh man dont get outta control 
 She was left wrestling in her silent anger 
 So hell I cant be there for her 
 I aint looking for answers 
 I dont want nothing is for free 
 I sure dont want your respect 
 I just wanna know whos talking to me 
 I just wanna know whos talkin to me 
 I know shes jackin homegirls mackin 
 Tried to make sure am I in love 
 So she fixes them oh to confuse them 
 Oh I know that girl thats what you do 
 She made relationships and then runs the other way 
 Unstoppable for you and me 
 She wont relinquish herself to you and I sense an emergency 
 She can cry she can hide in the lower east side 
 Theres a road in the fast lane cursed 
 Above all the infamous wicked circus of the fools 
 And if I really want to know how the pernicious stay on top 
 Oh they dont break no they dont fake 
 They make her wake 
 They dont stop 
 Yeah

 I just wanna know whos talkin to meIf you lose me you lose a good thing 
 Thats one thing I know for sure 
 If you lose me girl you lose a good thing 
 When you were sick I held your hand 
 When you were in trouble I tried to understand 
 To stay with you Id do anything I can 
 Cause losing you was not part of the plan 
 Melbourne is a tropical London 
 American in a tropical London 
 Abandoned in a tropical London 
 Oh no oh no 
 If you lose me you lose a good thing 
 A souvenir reminds me of you 
 Everyday I cast a glimpse of us two 
 Im the one called to the rescue 
 Thats why Im confused you withdrew 
 Medication lead to an altercation

 And I walk along but it was not my intention 
 Not my invention 
 But now my hearts been ripped wide open 
 Thats one thing I know for sureClimb in 
 Climb in 
 Climb inside me pain 
 Another night of drinkin 
 Another night of being 
 Out of my head and I dont know 
 Where I was last night 
 Drinkin on a empty stomach 
 Or an empty mind 
 It makes no difference when Im way out of line 
 Things I cant remember comes back to haunt me 
 A lot of people out there who seem to want me 
 Climb in the bottle and never come out 
 I may know nothing but Im good at something 
 I will drink till the sun comes up 
 No more one of these days gonna come out of my haze 
 Better hurry up its getting harder to come backIm back Im back Im back Im back Im back where I belong

 From the outside its a hit and run and 
 They look back and 
 You cant count on that and

 Days over at the track

 On his little sisters pink tenspeed

 The prophet speaks his language reeks 
 A vile dogma that schemes and sneaks 
 His blood is weak hes an oil sheik 
 Information leak operation tweek 
 Theres no security in the battlefield 
 Metal cannons shape the human shields 
 A brand new country theyre gonna build 
 One more riot thats selfwilled 
 State out of control 
 Its out of control 
 Were outta control were outta control 
 Were outta control were outta control 
 Inject the poison into the bloodstream 
 Pick up your shovel do what youre told 
 The probe is out the watchdog grows 
 To incredible lengths to incredible lows 
 Well off your target now you have missed 
 Deliberate lying and recklessness 
 Dont get crushed in the iron fist 
 Resist resist resist resist resist 
 Control 
 Were outta controlNever seen it come back again till it dragged my heart around 
 There was nothing coming in and there was nothing to be found 
 See I dont know if I can go through another day like this 
 Americas judging its favorite son and there aint nowhere missing 
 Cause Ive seen it cause I know it 
 Cause its the end of the world tonight 
 Take it down brbrbreak it down cause it aint coming back again 
 And the feeling of the rhythm drums it sings like me 
 See I dont like it you know I  and the rhythm would make you aware 
 Cause this is the end and I wish it was something better than this 
 Thats rightEverybody saying we gotta take a chance 
 And telling me what the hell went wrong 
 We only listen to the words that we sing 
 Now a million are singing along 
 Last one 
 We got it right you got wrong 
 Were still around last one to die 
 Were going up youre going down 
 The ones that counted us out 
 Regret that they picked the fight 
 We sit on top of the world 
 And were proving it every night 
 We got it right you got wrong 
 Through the storm and the gigs 
 And the good and the bad 
 There aint no doubt 
 We knew from the very first show what it was all about 
 Were still around last one to dieWoooooooooh 
 Ghost band ghost band 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our songs now 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our song 
 And they knew all the lyrics by heart now 
 And they play in the perfect key 
 And their tombstones are silhouetted 
 And the band I can barely see 
 Well our spirit fades hard and cheated 
 When the funerals over I cant leave it 
 Everyones going home Im defeated 
 Woooooooooh 
 And the energys so overwhelming 
 And the echo from the crowd is deafening 
 And the music conveyed is convincing 
 And the world doesnt seem so daunting 
 And the shimmer of light tells you secrets 
 In the moon the silhouettes in an instance 
 And we are seen in perfect cadence 
 Theres a ghost band girl playing our songI get violent when Im fucked up 
 I get silent when Im drugged up 
 I want excitement if I dont get none I go wild 
 I dont know what the fuck to do about it 
 If you play the game you get nothing out of it 
 So find out for yourself tryin to be good 
 You better cheat cheat 
 No reason to play fair 
 Cheat cheat you cant get anywhere 
 Cheat cheat if you cant win 
 Nobody knows what the fuck theyre doin 
 Its beyond their control Friday nights a ruin 
 If you wanna survive you better learn how to lie 
 Dont you use the rules 
 Theyre not for you theyre for the fools 
 And youre a fool if you dont know that 
 So use the rules you fuckin foolIf the police come 
 And tromp the state 
 And theres a straight crisis 
 And melee 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go let go let go disgruntled 
 Reflect something 
 Of course you descend 
 Fighting conflict 
 Running fugitive 
 If the police come 
 And meleeThey assumed I was guilty when I committed no crime 
 They said confessions bring lenience 
 So they put me on the line 
 So I protest a massacres at the Tineman Square 
 My friend said yo stay away man you better not go fuckin back there oh 
 They wouldnt let me write about my opinions about the state 
 And the freedom of expression they would never tolerate 
 And the military secrets that I never did steal 
 I didnt start no violence no and there was nobody that I killed 
 So I had a clear account of all the abuses of power 
 And the memories of homeland now gone sour 
 And I only got one weapon and its so plain for me to see 
 My only weapon I call poetry 
 And I dont even know why 
 The truth seems like lie 
 In My cell there is no sky 
 When I was arrested in shanghai 
 In the wealth and privilege huh I was not born 
 But devotion and freedom and liberty I was sworn 
 So every emotion is studied watched and controlled 
 Who gets paid who gets disciplined and who gets rolled so 
 Transmitter beams my coordinates anywhere on earth 
 And as radio waves surviellence satalite burst 
 Open up your skull and let some knowledge come in 
 Yeah crack open the cranium and let awareness begin oh 
 When I was arrested in shanghaiHey you in the red dress 
 I know youre not trying to impress me 
 In line from a distance 
 Too scared at all to ask your name 
 All alone in the dark summer night 
 And I regret to this day 
 That I never got your name 
 Do you wanna dance with me 
 Do you wanna dance rude girl 
 Waiting so patient 
 Waiting waiting for an invitation 
 From excursion 
 Tell my friends a different version 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 My little rude girl 
 Hey you in the red dress 
 My little rude girlAh no 
 No no 
 Yeah 
 With a gleaming success with the different tribes 
 Religious indifference mixed between the lies 
 Territorial companies they legitimize 
 Persecution to form enterprise 
 Now the UN is called to buffer it all 
 The problem is spreading international 
 Like Irelands Belfast its coming to be 
 A brand new key 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test 
 Shes got a new dress 
 Shes gonna look her best 
 Yugoslavias been blown to bits Yeah 
 Shes lookin to the west 
 Well entertain the idea of a peaceful end 
 Serb tanks slow down to the used to been 
 Of a world which has seen the citizens die 
 While the innocent children play near by now 
 When Im not getting through and see evidence 
 Another truth were bombing us 
 The time of civil war is shoot or I live 
 The chivalrous ones are never represented 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test Yeah 
 Yugoslavias been blown to bits Yeah 
 Allocating people for impurity 
 The methods of severance are dastardly 
 Try to cleanse the hands of the murdering 
 But the appendage of guilt is lingering 
 Shadows of soldiers lay nearby 
 The dead ones finally reach a compromise 
 Consumption of war lies in Bosnia 
 The destruction of war lies in BosniaWell the kids are all hopped up and ready to go 
 Theyre ready to go now 
 Theyve got their surfboards 
 And theyre going to the discotheque a go go 
 But she just couldnt stay

 Oh yeah oh yeah 
 Sheena is a punk rocker 
 Sheena is a punk rocker now 
 Shes a punk punk a punk rocker 
 Punk punk a punk rocker 
 Punk punk a punk rockerWell its just another day of getting into trouble 
 Chasing all the booze with another bottle 
 When I went into a bar looking for some quiet 
 I said the wrong thing and it turned into a riot 
 Hand good hand good face good face good 
 Im lucky to wake a face up 
 When I hit that summer with an angel on my shoulder 
 Another day living another day older 
 Thank God I made it out this far 
 Tell my story to the boys with a guitar 
 Im lucky to wake a face upIf you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 Its just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 Living and dying and the stories that are true 
 The secret to a good life is knowing when your through 
 Sarah ceased existing long before she died 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle ride 
 If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle rideSmall sacrifices or otherwise few 
 Unity for the sake of the many forms 
 Oh they use imagination only few can go 
 Touch of madness only few ever know 
 Well you can go on your way 
 Or you can stagger through hell 
 You can lie on your back 
 Or you can stand up tall 
 In a state of confusion 
 Got nothing to do 
 I was connected respected 
 Watching you make it through 
 And all this rhetoric 
 They tell me to sing along 
 They said that you were dying 
 But I know that they were wrong 
 Second generation melting pot 
 Youre ripped apart but youre never done 
 There she goes 
 Its all right 
 Nothing to do 
 Waste your time 
 Or you can lie on your back 
 State of confusion 
 You got nothing to do 
 Connected respected 
 Ill watch you make it through 
 But I know that they were wrongDont worry about me Im gonna make it alright 
 Got my enemies crossed out in my sight 
 I take a bad situation gonna make it right 
 In the shadows of darkness I stand in the light 
 You see its our style to keep it true 
 Ive had a bad year a lot to go through 
 Ive been knocked out beat down black and blue 
 Shes not the one coming back for you 
 If I fall back down youre gonna help me back up again 
 If I fall back down youre gonna be my friend 
 It takes disaster to learn a lesson 
 Youre gonna make it through the darkest night 
 Some people betray one and cause treason 
 Were gonna make everything alright 
 Well the worst of times now they dont phase me 
 Even if I look and act really crazy 
 I went way down she betrayed me 
 Now my vision is no longer hazy 
 Im very lucky to have my crew 
 They stood by me when she flew 
 If I fall back down youre gonna be my friendI got some hard times two punks upon a subway 
 Its a long way to go to get to Leicester Square 
 A hard line  Its the one you gotta cross 
 The one you gotta cross to get you anywhere 
 Michaels on his way to payback syndication 
 Of fisticuffs retired and his backstreet education 
 The 8ball stops him low 
 Then the enemys faces show 
 Its crystal clear it aint so clear 
 For folks who become broken in here 
 I got none 
 I got no mind for nothing 
 I got no insight I got no feelings 
 I got nothing that you want so stay away from here 
 The cocaines out then his world goes down the prime objective is fear 
 To rival forces from different times and places nowhere near 
 The tension begins to grow 
 His instincts tell him so 
 He jumps I jump I watch a punk and its another splatter oh yeah 
 I got some hard times two punks upon a subway 
 Mike gets whipped his bullface slapped around a cheap cigar 
 His gang comes in cause theyre always seeing the trouble from afar 
 He acts so apropos 
 Allusions at his door 
 He makes his point then jumps the joint 
 To the backseat with that mulatto girl yeah 
 The one you gotta cross to get you anywhereOut in the open 
 They aint gonna hide 
 Police state upon us 
 Prepare to collide 
 Theyre gonna keep you down 
 Step on your neck 
 Cant move no more 
 The weapon of their choosing 
 Is censorship and war 
 And I can see the line up now 
 Everyone is just partisan 
 You see one side claims victory 
 But its just a zero sum 
 Liberty and freedom 
 In quotations spray painted on the wall 
 Verbalized explosion 
 We will come back some day 
 If your ideas are suspect 
 Now youre in contempt 
 Report to the committee 
 No one is exempt 
 And the zealots and crusaders 
 They cant justify with threats 
 And intimidation 
 Designed to terrify 
 We will come back some dayGood morning heartache 
 Youre like an old friend 
 Come and see me again 
 Look up youre in Cleveland again 
 A solid line that never ends 
 I got stories that youll never believe 
 And I know it I wear it I wear it on my sleeve 
 There must be something about you that I liked 
 But right here in the rain you know it just dont seem right 
 I always go out I never hide 
 But in Cleveland I shouldve stayed inside 
 Testify my love for you 
 And I know it runs deep through your body too 
 From the cold black top to the hot concrete 
 And the old tin van it aint so sweet 
 Somewhere in America 
 Through the city at night 
 And you were far from home 
 But you knew it was gonna be all right 
 The unfortunate get preyed on by vultures eyes 
 Eightysix cents in these pockets of mine 
 You can take my money you can take my time 
 But you cant take my heart its in the city behindThe ending isnt here theres somethin wrong 
 But its cominreal soon I lock step Im gone 
 I said the feeling isnt fear theres something wrong

 Waitin for the buses but the buses wont come 
 All the docks are quiet theres somethin wrong 
 And theres no ships comin in I lock step Im gone 
 Where there once was a riot theres somethin wrong

 The stop signs broken and the meters goin down 
 Wild dogs are runnin themselves into the ground 
 Everything was clear for that moment in time 
 If I dont come back well throw me a line

 The pigs killed three workers 
 Harry Bridges grabbed the mic 
 The city shut down on July 6th 
 The workers were outraged 
 It was a general strike 
 The media claimed that the commies 
 Were taking over and some believed it was true 
 Three uncompromising strikes paved the way 
 Minnesota San Francisco Toledo 
 Over and over again 
 The doors are locked and the windows are broken 
 Eddie worked for General Motors

 Come along and tell your sister and your brother 
 The force of war dynamite blast 
 Rides on the weak and the poor 
 Dont want to see my brother in pain when the man fights big mans wars 
 Dont know nothing bout no red white and blue 
 Little men big 
 Too many win nobody lose 
 It all comes down to what will they choose 
 The conscience of the public can not be put to sleep 
 The conglomerate of the nations has no bounds in which they seek 
 Was it the Mob tellin the CIA to installrestore this state of fear 
 How many of us wish we were at Jeff Kennedys hearing say 
 Say 
 See them try to rule the world 
 We dont know why 
 Why they want to rule the world

 Dynamite blast of the force of war 
 Government rides on the weak and poor

 Her old man doesnt own her like he did before 
 He once was so clear but now hes a blur 
 Im not the only one whos not afraid of you 
 The avenues the same but the people are changing 
 She said she would be there they understand me 
 The homeless child is no roll she played 
 It is real as anything the system has made 
 Shes a monument forever standing 
 Inner city exposer can be extremely demanding 
 The pattern is circular as we pass the wine 
 She could no longer live with the lying 
 Her family tried to control her feelings 
 It just gave her new life a deeper meaning 
 Either you shut up or you shut down 
 Im not the only one 
 You motherfucker

 I almost had it I almost had it I came so close 
 Man I almost had it 
 Im checkin out Im listed MIAI hold the cold steel of my rifle as I dream of foreign lands 
 And I promise myself I will cherish every moment I can 
 But theres ghosts that follow me around everywhere I am 
 When I say goodbye I try to be strong 
 Now Im going back to the US where I belong 
 I aint never alone the war seems to follow me home 
 No longer an active soldier 
 When I walk down the street 
 Im shaking hands with everyone that I meet 
 And I watch everyone wondering what they see 
 Civilian ways are now whats foreign to me 
 I came off a long tour 
 I left this place in twoohthree 
 May we never forget the sacrifices 
 My friends made for me 
 I live in Marysville out on the county line 
 And my brother and my mother both visit me all the time 
 And visions of you are always running right through my mind 
 We always talk about what were gonna do when the war is won 
 Were gonna fix up them old cars and ride them into the sun 
 When I heard youre no longer with us man I was done 
 My friends made for meSet out to mislead sets out to murder 
 False appearance is everything to him 
 Is he good today or is he evil 
 In a violent craze spewing words of madness 
 It could go either way you never know 
 Conditioned to deceive and thats how he likes it 
 With all the guns going off who could say no to the guy 
 Watch out whos fuckin next 
 Cause Lokis playin tricks again

 Orthodox hasidic OG OisSo I packed everything I owned 
 Midnight christmas eve 
 A kid could feel alone 
 I drink my scotch 
 My mind goes astray 
 Starts out in a way 
 I cried when I had no shoes 
 Till I met the man with no feet 
 Its just a 
 Holiday sunrise 
 I suddenly realized 
 I got no alibis 
 Relatives of mine said 
 They were born again 
 Fucked up world has made me born against 
 Im a sinner and my soul should be cleansed 
 Ill take my chances when Im deadTook the 60 bus out of downtown Campbell 
 Ben Zanotto he was on there he was waiting for me 
 All the punk rockers and the moon stompers are out 
 On the corners where theyre sparing for change 
 I started thinking you know I started drinking 
 I dont really remember too much of that day 
 Something struck me funny when we ran out of money 
 Where do you go now when youre only 15 
 With the music execution and the talk of revolution 
 It bleeds in me 
 And it goes 
 Give em the boot the roots the radicals 
 Give em the boot you know Im a radical 
 Give em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo 
 The radio was playing Desmond Dekker was singing 
 On the 43 bus as we climbed up the hill 
 Nothing incoming but the reggae drumming 
 And we all come from unloving homes I said 
 Why even bother and pick up the bottle 
 Mr bus driver please let these people on 
 Rudegirl Carol was a miniskirt girl 
 My blurry vision saw nothin wrong 
 On my stereo 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Took the 60 bus out of downtown Campbell 
 On the corners where theyre sparing for change 
 And the radio was playing Desmond Dekker was singing 
 On the 43 bus as we climbed up the hill 
 My blurry vision saw nothing wrong 
 It bleeds in me and it goesHey little sister 
 Do you know what time it was 
 When you finally seen 
 All your broken dreams 
 Come crashing down your door 
 They demand an answer 
 And they demand it quick 
 Or the questions fade 
 And then the wasted days 
 Come crawling back for more 
 And I said 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 And who pulls the strings 
 It starts and ends with you 
 The face of isolation 
 Well thats one you recognize 
 Well you cant get straight 
 Its a lonely place 
 And one you do despise 
 Boredom is for sale now 
 And helplessness you feel 
 Its a wounded dove 
 And the hawks are above 
 Blood splattered in a reel to reel 
 I was almost over 
 And my world was almost gone 
 And in a sudden rush 
 I could almost touch 
 The things that Id done wrong 
 My jungles made of concrete 
 And through the silence I could feel 
 My aim is true 
 And I will walk on through 
 These mountains made of steel 
 Oh I say it starts and ends with you 
 I say it starts and ends with youWheres my girl where has she gone 
 She once was beautiful and innocent 
 I cant believe in what she says 
 I look at her and she looked the other way 
 Disconnected from feeling all right 
 Disconnected and it aint black and white 
 Disconnected theres a sword through the dove 
 Disconnected from the country I love 
 I remember you when you we young and strong 
 In your summer dress and legs so long 
 My memories are only for me 
 I prefer them to reality 
 You think its over but you better think again 
 Neither grace nor sweetness just malicious intent 
 Its you and me baby so we better watch our back 
 Cause if we are standing together we aint never gonna crack 
 And we took the Greyhound into the night 
 With the city on the left and the country on the right 
 And I knew when I saw you I read it in your eyes 
 I heard your voice break when were trying not to die 
 Disconnected disconnected disconnected 
 Disconnected from the country I loveYou 
 For Weeks youre fallin 
 Guys are dien 
 Hit the call  Theyll call you back 
 Somenll use you too 
 Usin me usin you 
 What can ya do

 I fuckin hate you  Youre a rattlesnake 
 Yo 
 And I hate you  Youre a RattlesnakeI didnt trust him cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didnt go there I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite me 
 I saw some better days from Beijing to Hunter Place 
 A portrait of the sum of the last couple years 
 See I lost an image an image of chaos 
 All Ive ever known is isolation and pain 
 Im on the verge of losing everything every single day 
 In all this deadly drama you know I see myself fall 
 Ive been confusing 
 A lost canyon 
 Consuming it all 
 I didnt trust him cause he smiled at me first 
 So I may be antisocial and shy and yo I found myself a job 
 But I journey and complain through incredible odds 
 Its the simple things I guess a delicate balance 
 I never really thought I could make it all happen 
 Now the anarchist kid gives a fuck about you 
 I stood up every single time I fell 
 Its just you 
 Just as if it was to despite them 
 YeahI saw a man get the beat down 
 Took his money and his wallet left him dead on the ground 
 I saw them gather celebrate the crime 
 Teaching us the laughter another lesson of mankind 
 I raised my hand I got another question 
 If I start to riot will I get protection 
 Cause Im a kid whos got a lot of problems 
 If I throw a brick maybe the brick will go and solve them 
 Oh yeah I wanna riot 
 Im boiling up the citys on heat 
 Red alert tention you know its on the street 
 Code blue the city of the dead 
 Sirens in the night with the lights bloody red 
 See how we do this see how we ride 
 Throw a brick light the fuse dodge a bullet duck inside 
 A statistic hammered on my brain 
 Branded with another nother pawn in the game 
 Oh yeah I wanna riot 
 In front of me perpetuated 
 Crying in line I got a burning to be 
 My face is burning burning so quick 
 Burning like a candle at the end of its wick 
 Well I turn the dial I turn the channel 
 I turn it to a arab fighting the eternal battle 
 I need some help man there is no doubt 
 If Im gonna go down Im gonna take somebody out 
 Riot 
 RiotBlackhawk down Blackhawk down Blackhawk down below 
 Blackhawk down Blackhawk down Blackhawk down below 
 Theres a Blackhawk down in Mogadishu American government issue 
 Conflict in Somalia never came to an end

 Rollin with the punk rockers

 Fake guns fake bands 
 Fake punk I aint buying 
 Hit the road 
 All I know 
 Rock and roll aint dying about fifteen deep 
 We hit the streets low ridin 
 By the time we made it to New Orleans 
 It must have been half past three 
 By the time we made it to Memphis 
 We were crazy 
 Tonight youre our blanket 
 And youre gonna keep us warm 
 Tonight protect us from the storm 
 He was back causing trouble 
 Times theyre a comin round 
 Oh no let me go to another round 
 Tuesday night is when the storms gonna settle down 
 Had a glance circumstance 
 Dont cause trouble bound 
 Shes the one all alone I come lookin 
 Smoke and mirrors as I watch 
 Aw that girl was trippin 
 Its no fun lost again 
 To have your heart broken 
 Greed is from a world that is built on hustling 
 The breaks were falling when they had failed 
 Every road can lead ya straight down to fucking hell 
 Rain stopped falling when they had failed 
 Every road can take ya straight down to hell 
 Doing nothing here everyone straight trippin 
 Happy at times are gone past starts slippin 
 This will be enough to keep me on the road livin 
 Good every night in a different city Ill be sleepin 
 Let me know here we go met a girl named Lola 
 Is she here Is she there Drinking Jack and cola 
 She says Tim where ya been I got somethin to show ya 
 Lola fired off her clothes and started rock and rollin 
 Tonight protect us from the stormWell I went south with a case of survival 
 To amend my heart thats paper thin 
 You see I felt her words and her images filed 
 Im gonna carry my heart to New Orleans 
 I have no home to go so I wander a while 
 From coast to coast from sin to sin 
 From the coldest shores to the warmest islands 
 Been around the world back to New Orleans 
 Well shes got pride like a million lions 
 Shes got a scar on her velvet face 
 Shes got a smile like a newborn child 
 Shes got a walk a stoic grace 
 I never slept that night until my arrival 
 I romanticized a long embrace 
 You see I lost my tongue and burned my Bible 
 But made it back home to New Orleans 
 Well I held my breath and I swam for miles 
 When all was lost and hell took place 
 You see it rained all night and the city she flooded 
 It rained all night in New Orleans 
 Yeah it rained all night in New OrleansRepeat 2x 
 Back down no back down comin up 
 Rise up no rise up showin up 
 Lock down no lock down comin up 
 International coverup 
 What about the state of the union 
 What about the guns theyre using 
 What about the kids that dont matter 
 What about a genaral strike 
 You dont know what its like 
 Whats its like what its like 
 Repeat 2x 
 What about the cage getting rattled 
 What about the international battle 
 What about the kids who are dreaming 
 What about the kid who got stopped 
 Whats its like what its likeMy life the blessing 
 Understand my aggression 
 I dont regret nothing 
 Its all been a lesson 
 Me and my friend got the music 
 Like a loaded gun were gonna use it 
 Tell us we aint shit I wont listen 
 Try to hit us but you keep on missing 
 I knew the sentence then 
 I knew it was gonna blow 
 Dont say I didnt warn you 
 Apocalypse radio 
 Sometimes Im a total wreck 
 I want to break someones neck 
 I get a subwoofer going 
 Four twelves get my blood stream going 
 Never saw it coming paid my price in time 
 Its been ten years or more with all the 
 Battle scars in my mind 
 Apocalypse radioSolidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 You said it was nothing I knew it was something 
 I was no surprisin I saw you cryin 
 About you  Said now what went wrong 
 About you  Said you cant go on 
 About you  Said it was a long time gone 
 About you  Now your lifes too long 
 Didnt see it comin your fears went hunting 
 9 millimeter stops you running 
 About you  Said the pressure on 
 About you  Now you cant go on 
 About you  Now youre long time gone 
 About you  So what went wrong 
 Bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun 
 Bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gun bullet and a gunYoure making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 Youre making enemies 
 Don killed Anyas father 
 In a brutal sword fight 
 The old man regrouped 
 And came back from the dead 
 Well the old man came back from the dead 
 And dragged Don Giovanni to hell 
 So dont fuck with me kidFor 24 hours on the Ivory Coast 
 They release soldiers from their post 
 They dedicate champagne for a toast 
 They pay dividends to the countrys host 
 They said Tonight you can leave your home 
 But tomorrow but tomorrow its gonna be the way of the gun 
 And the curfew wont allw you to roam roam roam 
 And the bullets will let you know when the big dog comes round your door 
 Who is the killer 
 Wooooh oh oh 
 Stonecold killer 
 Woooooh oh oh 
 Food for the trigger 
 Woh oh oh 
 Ill shoot ya down right on sight 
 If youre out at the wrong time of night 
 And in a civil war theres no civil rights 
 In the dead of day run for your life 
 And tomorrow its gonna be the way of the gun 
 And the curfew wont let you roam roam roam 
 And the trenches are dug 
 And the bones aint too shiver 
 The tastes of war so cold and bitter 
 And the human race is the face of the killer 
 And the cost of life is rarely considered 
 Woh oh ohYeah 
 Theres something in the street tonight 
 Dont know what it is but it wont keep quiet 
 Breaking through your masses on your radio brodcaster 
 Theres something in the air tonight 
 And its turning in to a full fledged riot 
 Singin for a last dance  someone tryin to find the truth 
 Oh Nine Lives  Im gonna come right back for you 
 Theres something in the world today 
 Dont know what it is but it sure smells rotten 
 Babylons burning and the fire seems waterproof 
 Theres someone in your home tonight 
 You think you know who they are but something aint so right 
 I look a different way and boy they dont feel the same about me 
 And I run and I run and I ride and I ride 
 And I live and I live and I die and I die 
 And I know it was all for you and me x4Another lesson has been learned 
 In this days modern times 
 Strangers in the mist appear 
 Now theres war all the time 
 Systematically go and destroy 
 Commit another atrocity 
 Aggressors are in their places 
 Manmade catastrophe 
 Im not looking for a fight now 
 And I dont care whos wrong or right now 
 So release the dove into flight now 
 So we can start right now 
 We can start right now 
 A small keys gonna open the door 
 Across the border to a new land 
 And in the new land a sand storm roars 
 Under spell and the ghost of a man 
 A pack of men theyre yours to stay 
 Their prayers fall upon deaf ears 
 Machiavelli owns a machine gun now 
 And I see it in the mask and a puppeteer 
 Humanity has no blame in this case this big game of chess for us all 
 Hostility explodes in the mess now your arm got blood all over the wall

 And solidarity on the razors edge boy what Youre a big puncher now right

 Ha ha ha 
 We can start right nowOkay check this out 
 It aint impossible it aint easy 
 Opportunities shiftin here 
 So far the strategy aint workin 
 The facts are in its so very clear 
 I do what I want I cant predict the future 
 And those who can I know that they are lyin 
 And then the truth can be hard to swallow 
 In a soap opera world leaders are cryin 
 Correction I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin for direction 
 You can burn a book if you dont like the answers 
 Or join forces with an axe grind 
 USA protecting your cancers 
 A list of hatreds easy to find 
 And theres a growing sentiment in America 
 If you listen closely you can hear them all 
 Right is right wrong is wrong 
 And the evil considered bad behavior 
 Bad generations polarized view 
 No one leaves home to go and help you 
 Watch CNN and then you know

 Hey Hey Hey 
 American shopping malls 
 Where a product is sold and bought here 
 Euthanizing the public 
 While the dead walk the escalators 
 They come from the loudspeakers 
 They hear a subliminal message 
 An ad entices you the consumer 
 And theres no way to find it 
 Is this human freedom 
 Hedonistic excess 
 Junky consumerism 
 Massproduction toxic sickness 
 Everyone is wearing now 
 Plastic masks that they hide behind 
 Marketing massive sales of nothing 
 Everything is selling 
 The arrogance 
 Lost me with nonsense 
 Well its so aggressive 
 Yet so repulsive 
 Well its a noxious culture 
 Of the swarming vultures 
 And I see an imposter 
 And hes coming to get you 
 Is it you whos born frustrated1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 No one is safe here were all in danger 
 Through the corridor I see a stranger 
 Robbin and ransacking I see him walking 
 Lock your doors now I hear him knocking 
 Up to no good up to no good 
 Like a spark on a wire or a splinter in wood 
 Best intentions get misunderstood 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good x6 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 Quick like a snake hes good at stealing 
 Hell even steal the plaster off the ceiling 
 Cloaked in darkness I see him standing 
 Making moves in the night hes a ghost man 
 Criminals I understand them 
 Watch your back cause well come at random 
 Born to lose and you end up in the system 
 Hes our friend now were gonna miss him 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good x8 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Well I drank from Tahwehs songs and I dined on a devils tail 
 Well Im the best at selling Christ and Ill see you all in hell 
 Cause Im already dead 
 Well Ive been to hell and back one million times 
 And the hurricane came and water all the way to sounds 
 If God and Satan both held my hand 
 They said stay with us til you understand 
 Well my mother was a whore she was blind deaf and dumb 
 Well if you look at me across well youre gonna feel my gun 
 You see I lie cheat and steal and Ill break your fucking neck 
 And youll curse out my name when you take your last breath 
 Cause Im alBooks on Emerson 
 Books on Thoreau 
 But all I read was maps of the road 
 And I was three thousand miles away from you 
 All the while I was twentytwo 
 What do you do to know who you are 
 The best way for me to drop out on tour 
 You went to Upstate NxY New York to go to school 
 To secure the roll with your parents 
 I got a new perspective on you 
 All the good and bad that we went through 
 I know you better than you know you 
 Cause I got a new perspective on you 
 I never needed much I never liked to loom 
 But a gesture can get me from across the room 
 The first night we talked until while the sun caught up 
 Transparent people melting all around us 
 You left in a plane I left in a van 
 Played nightclub houseparties and auditoriums 
 Saw Germany England Italy with my band 
 I know you better than your new friends 
 Ford Econdlane September 93 
 Driving 10 hours until my eyes are blurry 
 3 packs of Winstons and a bag of seeds 
 Tapes of x and a thermos of coffee 
 6 weeks on and 10 days off 
 Then I go back on the road for another show 
 This is all that Ive ever done 
 Girl I got nothing to fall back on 
 But I got a new perspective on you 
 All of the good and bad that we went through 
 Cause I got a new perspective on youDont call me white Dont call me white 
 Dont call me white Dont call me white 
 The connotations wearing my nerves thin 
 Could it be semantics generating the mess were in 
 I understand that language breeds stereotype 
 But whats the explanation for the malice for the spite 
 I wasnt brought here I was born 
 Circumcised categorized allegiance sworn 
 Does this mean I have to take such shit 
 For being fairskinned No 
 I aint a part of no conspiracy 
 Im just youre average Joe 
 Represents everything I hate 
 The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind 
 The vast majority of sheep 
 A buttoned collar starched and bleached 
 Constricting veins the blood flow to the brain slows 
 Theyre so fuckin ordinary white 
 Were better off this way 
 Say what youre gonna say 
 So go ahead and label me 
 An asshole cause I can 
 Accept responsibility for what Ive done 
 But not for what I am 
 Dont call me white Dont call me whiteTheres a power in a union theres a power inside 
 Theres a power inside every man alive 
 Theres a power in a union theres a power inside 
 When I look into your empty pockets 
 The storm is nothing cause its already here 
 Look into an honest mans eyes now 
 Oh the only thing youre gonna see is fear 
 Know what its like to be alone now 
 What its like not to have a friend 
 Some make  get a foe now baby 
 But the unions gonna be here all the way to the end 
 Theres a power inside every man aliveShes a Salvador immigrant head through a thin wall 
 A frail hooker holding her carnal walls 
 Gleaming sky scraper bunker he looked down 
 Laugh hysterically and then he spread around 
 On Hoover Street then he must be alone 
 The precious little kid cashed the woes 
 Salvadorian girl she kind of made you spill 
 Her brother Mario got shot 4 times in da head 
 Now see poor Mario he caught a hot one 
 Through the lung now hes done so God bless the man 
 Cocaine moved through that system like a river forever winding 
 To the last party of the lower class 
 Even distance just a bunch of kids who dont wanna finish last 
 Now see the market place has changed the weight of the scale 
 You either get out and die or go to jail 
 And your best intentions splinter and frail 
 And a few weeks of promises and attempts to fail 
 Its a glasspipe murder 
 Glasspipe murder 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 They kick a bottle of beer and a letter 
 Simple things made Mario feel better 
 You see it falls on you and it falls on me 
 Selfannihilation catastrophe 
 Two packs of cigarettes 
 For two dollars and seventy cents and a 
 Bottle of wine thats been opened 
 And he said Why do I do this 
 A shiver through his body like a bottle of CC 
 Not encouraging reality or me 
 He said Its who I am baby back to it 
 Off the deep end the record changed 
 You see no one stood up and cheered for him 
 Everyone sat down with something that happened 
 Began to happen 
 Its an old school dorm mystery 
 And the handcuffs bleed 
 Who was the killer its in theYeah 
 13 red and white stripes flying White for skin and red for dying 
 Why cant I  walk on through And not feel like  one is in hell 
 We dont need no water let the motherfucker burn 
 Whoooo for dying 
 Ah is in hell 
 Why cant I  walk on through And not feel like  one is in hellDead bodies everywhere 
 Piles of blood entrails and hair 
 Im bleeding from the inside 
 From the armageddon outside 
 Disfigured and oblique 
 From the appetite that I seek 
 Im a hungry cannibal 
 Im a rabid animal 
 My remains are being scattered 
 Ive been bludgeoned Im in pain 
 Stomach pains are coming 
 And they strike with demon speed 
 Reaccuring rotting dreams 
 From this place the demons speak 
 My skin exfoliates 
 My patience terminates 
 Unfold to unholy urges 
 Unearthed with urgency 
 The holocaust was nothing 
 Compared to my lividity

 I hear the voices but I cant make out their words 
 Saying things saying things that 
 I got something sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eye 
 I feel unusual from thinking 
 About the underground decay God help me 
 Kill beneath the camera watch the world begin to cry 
 Its not from pity it comes from 
 Whats been sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eyeWell they tell me theres a pie up in the sky 
 Waiting for me when I die 
 But between the day youre born and when you die

 And then the harder they come 
 The harder they fall one and all Oh oh oh

 Didnt hear what they were saying I ran through the mayhem of a police state on my block 
 Like a bombBlood on the situation 
 Blood on the street sometimes 
 Youre gonna hit the cold concrete 
 Ok lets go 
 Bloody Thursday was July 6th

 3 uncompromising strikes paved the way Minn Sf and Toledo 
 Blood on the situation

 Against the power raise your fist 
 Oppress the power that exists 
 Raise your fist raise your fist 
 Oh the power that exists 
 In the land of freedom I will make a claim 
 Forth rack on production politicians this is all insane 
 Heart of the heartland or they stream the blood 
 Where invisibly for one thousand and third 
 No alliance sure no cross to bear 
 No crack to follow no police to share 
 Apathetic revolution people go put to sleep 
 As the people are wake up theyll be rioting the streets 
 Oh the power that existsReconciliation in what they already knew 
 Humanities lost when the powers vested in a few 
 Spread out like a million locusts covering the sun 
 Protagonists and infidels gonna speak out on the run 
 Deep rooted back and forth failed from both sides 
 Triggered a sudden excitement into the battle night 
 Shadow of Robin Island cloud the symbol of change 
 Nelson spent 18 years on Robin Island estranged

 Better days around the corner for you and me 
 Receive the horizon dawns golden glow 
 Lars 
 It takes courage to make it in this land 
 So dont forget but forgive every man 
 And prosperitys river it will forever flow 
 Honor is among us honor is all we knowOn the cusp of an explosion 
 I answer with evil thats the way that I play it 
 Street Turks multiple contusions 
 I gnash spit 
 I grind my teeth 
 Got a gun and a knife 
 Staring back at you 
 No security force or vigilantes 
 Overweight ego can dethrone me 
 Ostracized if not otherwise 
 Left to my own device youll surly see 
 Staring back at youOriginally by Sham 69

 And I say 
 Nobody knows me Im all alone

 Then waited to confide in Hollywoods concert backslide 
 With affordable lives and a sunroof nestled among the filth

 Im a hyena fighting for lion share 
 Sometimes the lions share aint there 
 Absent from political authority an animal Ive become 
 Total disorder and confusion is the lifestyle that I run 
 Permit me to do what I want and I will Im a nomad to travel 
 Concrete glass stone and gravel 
 Every time I turn around its the same sad story 
 Getting ganked I wish it could end and lifes commissary

 Who can I trust in a world of greed 
 When Im taught to take and not to give 
 Who can I trust when Im taught to take and not to give

 Concrete glass stone and gravel

 Punk rockers skinhead misfits and misunderstood kids

 There was romance in the air for sure 
 Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Youth was exhausted 
 Some take it harder then most 
 My best friend he crumbled and he withered away withered away 
 I went back to the palm trees 
 The safest place Ben could ever be 
 Mixed his ashes with the dirt 
 Hell be safe there Yeah 
 There was romance in the airHe was an artist and a writer 
 And a poet and a friend 
 In a mans life he will take a fall

 Hes shooting dope in the mens room 
 At the station Daly City Train 
 Have you ever seen an angel well I know I have 
 You see they stay here for a while then they fly away 
 Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him 
 When he rolled the dice you know he never thought twice 
 Never thought twice about being here 
 Some grow up and some grow old 
 But what about the kid who never learned the rules 
 Spent all these years on this earth 
 When you look back its just a flicker of time 
 Jackyl was one of the ones that perished 
 Yeah he was one of the ones that was already saved 
 Through all this evil and wreckage yeah 
 He maintained a sense of himself 
 Some men are in prison although they walk the streets at night 
 Other men who got the lockdown are free as a bird in flight 
 How about the hour in the system that ended 
 In a oneway line our measures could not stand it 
 Never thought twice about being hereJimmy said he could handle this 
 Oh hes from Los Angeles oh 
 Jimmy said he could handle this 
 Born and raised in West Los Angeles 
 Dads a lawyer Mummys asleep

 I know the Catholic girl was sinning 
 Sabrina Sabrina SabrinaNo God no truce 
 A fire from the sky rains brimstone from above 
 A whole world implosion got too close to the sun 
 A vein from a power struggle explode into a bloody mess 
 Rupturing the nations core blushing from the stress 
 The atheists get in line awaiting the coming destruction 
 Religious dogma corrupted and corrupter 
 With a man made of sin leads a full scale invasion 
 Drains the life from the skins abrasion 
 No restoring order in a full scale attack 
 Theres no fucking vision theres no voice its all black 
 Then you break down with a villainous call 
 Puss bleeding profusely from the city wallsAnother show with a fucked up promoter 
 Kids sent in by the media controller 
 They arrived in a 87 Ford with a gun rack 
 Case of Bud and stiletto blade 
 Its the kind of show you end up at 
 When you get stabbed by the blade 
 Big business made 
 I wanna go boot

 The main controller tried to buy me out but I didnt buy it 
 Some people did and there is nothing I could do about it 
 Case of Bud and a stiletto blade 
 When you get stabed by the blade 
 The kids unloads his glock into the urban blight 
 Bullets sprayed the car as we drove into the night 
 We lived to tell the story and Im goona tell you

 And give compliments and praises 
 To the ones they despite 
 Practicing your smile in the mirror all the while 
 Try to cultivate the style of the bastards in power

 Cause their nervous twitch is telling 
 Youre coming off smelling like the pig of the hour 
 I got a lot of people telling me Im outta my mind 
 And I dont know why 
 My brain was bleeding and my fingers were proceeding 
 Through a notebook I was keeping since the dawning of time 
 Senses were corroded 
 You know that I was loaded 
 You were dealing I was reeling 
 From the feeling and the madness was concealing 
 Its a siren song 
 People that I trusted would surely have me busted 
 If they ever had a clue what was really going on 
 I got a lot of people telling me Im out of my mind 
 And I dont know why I dont know why lets go 
 And I dont know why I dont know why lets goBusiness man come shake my hand

 They said I got some rights and I really shouldnt knock it 
 What can we do x7 
 Broken bones broken rules 
 They can all be fixed oh yeah 
 So let those who battle with the pen 
 And the others with the fist its the gospel now 
 The strong ones will be defiant with words that can convince 
 You can take this as rules but Ill take it as a dis 
 Well they wanna hold me with wrongful suspicion 
 And Im all bundled up in an awkward position 
 And they say its all part of a hundred year tradition 
 And I do feel they got a mental condition

 Tell me what its like to get that old cold feeling 
 Spend all night just looking at the ceiling 
 Living in a blown out hotel building 
 All the machines are broken down 
 Its a narrow path between evil and good 
 Watch the strong man in his decline 
 Another man dying is misunderstood 
 All I see is damnation 
 Whole worlds gone to hell 
 Dont see things the way they were 
 Only see things the way they are now 
 Realize now that its gone too far 
 Look into the eyes of the dead and gone 
 Now all the machines are broken down 
 Its a song and dance between evil and good 
 Early stages of final decline 
 All alone misunderstood 
 Whole worlds gone 
 Whole worlds gone to hellKick the kick drum increase the weight of the sound 
 The dialog of maximum decibles is enough to move the fucking ground 
 Im gonna amplify the rage of a class 
 Thats thought inferior the message in the volume 
 This songs a carrier 
 Unwritten rules 
 Rules understood 
 Boomin out the speakers and amps in the hood 
 I like to drink beer play music and go to shows

 Im just looking for a place that I can call my home and 
 Is anybody out there got a soul 
 Cause Im just looking for a girl 
 The girl with a heart of gold 
 She over turns once again count with her champagne case 
 She goes straight down the rathole with her 
 Total recklessness and 
 Tomorrow will come on through 
 And I got nothing but a sillouette girl 
 Met her in darkness 
 I said Im just looking for a girl 
 Yeah Im in the corner I start over

 Breakdown 
 BreakdownIn the army of Babylon Im a young Al Capone 
 My self an outlaw in the eyes of the Lord 
 Good man lose and the bad man win 
 The blind and the sick I attenuate them 
 Barrels of concrete and melted steel 
 Black smoke rises like a ghost in the field 
 Hardened lungs deep breathing the air 
 That stings the life from within me 
 Succobus catches on and it wont let me go 
 The leprosy sets in and you got no glue 
 The 3rd world working on the factory floor 
 Its so dark in there you cant see the sun no more 
 Cold and burnt are frostbitten hands 
 That leaves you like a flower thats been pulled from the sands 
 Rabid dogs chewing at my feet 
 Trying to protect their side of the street 
 Army of Babylon young Al Capone yeah 
 Young Al Capone yeah young Al Capone yeah 
 In the darkness among lonely spirits 
 Hopeless atmosphere steel gates spear it 
 So simplistic so realistic so sadistic 
 Yea you lose it all yea 
 Ok Tim take this one homeHey ho let the bombs blow 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I aint got control x2 
 No control of destiny 
 Wake me up to reality 
 I can just see anarchy 
 And there aint no telling 
 Whos in charge here 
 Hey ho let the bombs blow 
 Dead men they tell no tales 
 Satan finally broke out of Hell 
 And everybodys got something to sell 
 Cause there aint no good 
 That I can see here 
 People going crazy situation Code Red 
 And the whole worlds out of control 
 The walls and the fences are being torn down 
 And the bodies of the murdered are getting cold 
 Wild dogs gone mad 
 Smell the blood of their own kill 
 The weakest of the pack 
 Nothing is the way that it seems around here 
 Very clear its a very deadly trap 
 I aint got control x2I could not fit in 
 I was the one who got caught 
 I was the one who got realized 
 I was the one who got dropped 
 Shut out banished and locked away 
 The knife that did me in I was carry to this day 
 Rejected 
 Crossing the bridges in the land of the forgotten 
 Distrust existed that I never saw 
 Deep seated trust I was a victim of 
 Rejected 
 Unspoken among the more privileged or the so called 
 I was not good enough not good enough at all 
 At first out of lonliness I tried to conform 
 But all that bullshit just left me all alone 
 Left me all alone yeahPick me back up just to throw me back down 
 Apologies too late when youre up against the wall 
 Compassion heals while duplicity kills 
 You say that Im different you say that Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you 
 You moved up the ladder at very rapid speed 
 We moved methodically and calmly 
 When you got to the top you see enemies 
 If I knew back then what I know now 
 That it would all turn out like this 
 Id sit back and Id watch you squirm 
 Cause you say Im different you say Im different man 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about youRealize youre 
 Dehumanized you 
 Criticize your existence 
 Its your demise when no sun arise when youre 
 Paralyzed by your lack of resistance 
 She dont know who she is 
 She dont know where shes going 
 Down below where the fires glowing 
 Tenderloin Tenderloin Tenderloin 
 The tricks she gets them 
 Shes not a victim 
 She makes a list of them and reads them all alone 
 For money shes walking down on Larkin 
 In TI theyre rocking all night long 
 Tenderloin Tenderloin TenderloinEchoes of reggae 
 Comin through my bedroom wall 
 Havin a party up next door 
 But Im sittin here all alone 
 Two lovers in the bedroom 
 And the other starts to shout 
 All I got is this blank stare 
 And that dont carry no clout at all 
 Destination unknown 
 Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho 
 Hes singin and shes 
 There to lend a hand 
 Hes seen his name on the marquee 
 But she will never understand 
 Once again hes leavin and shes 
 There with a tear in her eye 
 Embraces with a warm gesture 
 Its time time to say goodbye 
 Rubys heart aint beatin 
 Cause she knows the feelin is gone 
 Shes not the only one 
 Who knew theres somethin wrong 
 Her lovers in the distance 
 As she wipes a tear from her eye 
 Rubys fading out she disappears 
 Ruby ruby ruby ruby sohoCrime epidemic  Never going down 
 Unsympathetic  Put you in the ground 
 System systematic  Survival in the town 
 Only if you let it  Gonna drag you down 
 Evils my friend 
 Evils my friend again 
 If you wanna go and get em  you better stand and fight 
 Youre never gonna let em  take away your right 
 And the bad ones forget them  Running to the night 
 And the good ones regret them  Ready to ignite 
 Evils my friend againThe common man doesnt suffer pain like this 
 Only the sort that has never been kissed 
 Let us adore our beautiful son 
 Hes ridin on the rivers of Babylon 
 Burnin up shootin up bring on the brightness 
 See the son of god is comin up and there is a likeness 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin 
 When youre brought up youre caught up in a system thats goin 
 No one answers no one takes that call from you 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is 
 What do what do what do what do I desire 
 Some parents house is on fire 
 Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground 
 The neighborhood will watch without a sound 
 Will someone be a witness please tell me that hes crazy 
 But hes not and they know that and they cant get him cause hes not crazy 
 Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority 
 Hit em ship em club em submitted conformity 
 My hand went blind 
 You were in the vein clairvoyant 
 I make love to my transistor my transistor 
 And my transparency from the balcony 
 I looked out on the big field on the big field 
 It opens like the cover of an old bible 
 And out come the wolves out come the wolves 
 Their paws trampling in the snow the alphabet 
 I stand on my head and watch it all go away 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin when 
 Youre brought up and caught up in a system that is goinEverybody wants to come now but no one wants to pay 
 I like to show em but they do anyway 
 I was knocked down to my knees 
 Same thing for my  
 Gunshot Gunshot Gunshot in my heart 
 Sometimes there are guys I can deal with 
 Everythings imperative but I dont fucking 
 I know where you are but I never know or care 
 Ive got ideas but no decision 
 Gunshoooooot 
 Gunshot Gunshot Gunshot in my heartI want to go where the action is 
 I want to fly through the urban blight 
 I want to live like a shadow in the dark 
 And only move at night 
 A story bought a one story house that 
 Lets the winter bleed 
 21 years old and no money to read 
 How did she know the roof would cave in 
 Beat up bruised a record thats broken 
 Adinas crying again 
 Beat up chevy with a trailer in town 
 Is what they call home now 
 One more hill or river to cross on 
 On the way to another town 
 Crying in her beer and always running away 
 May be not so much running but hopin 
 For better days 
 Repeat 4x 
 Hey Hey 
 Shes crying againEvery city got an artery where the blood breaks down 
 An avenue or a boulevard and a boy who wears a crown 
 Indigant live styles mplies simply lack of means 
 Dogmatical authoritarians dictate the cities remains 
 A promise 
 To go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on me 
 When the factory shut down so did the place he lived 
 Blood money for junk bonds by a white collar fugitive 
 All the tax free insentives aint goin to help him now 
 Generations of job security gone out like the horse and plow 
 To go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 My old man worked his troubled life in a nowhere dead end 
 He drank the pain away Ill be damned if thats me having my dreams robbed 
 The working class carries a country that has been rotting inside for years 
 The rigs cuffed my old man in the front yard I saw through my eyes of tears 
 A promise to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on meNo woman no cry 
 No woman no cry 
 No woman no cry

 When no more machine guns striking and theres silence instead 
 Yeah like a lion1951 small town kids got nothing to do 
 But dream all night of movie stars and Cadillac cars 
 And beautiful girls and big city lights 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 From every corner of this great old nation 
 Good kids succumb to the depths of temptation 
 Homecoming queens get lost in the cracks 
 And quarterback heroes get strung out on smack 
 You wake up one day with a monkey on your back 
 With foil on all your windows and youre hiding all your tracks 
 The sheriffs shotgun dont make a sound 
 When its pointed at your corpse after he shot you down 
 LA River dragnet coming downYou said protect me 
 And you left me 
 On Christmas Eve

 Whoo 
 Sham 69 roots reggae on my temple 
 With a 45 record too on the turntable 
 With the turntable kicking man it took away yeah 
 When the sun come a rising and let the song begins 
 Singing 
 Were on a mission got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour collision course 
 Lars 
 With the glow of the light on my radio dial 
 For better beats from the record file 
 I dropped the needle watching creetons drop 
 While Im playing Pacman at the record shop 
 Deep in the night and the chaos comes 
 My rhythm gets driven by the beat of drums 
 45 33 RPM 
 Hey Mr DJ let us in 
 Tim 
 Check it 
 One hundred miles an hour 
 One hundred miles an hour collision courseCar lights flash my eyes 
 Blinded hypnotized 
 Lord knows Im living and Im never coming back 
 Now one generation dies next one wins the prize 
 And thats the big surprise 
 Theres demise in all of their lies 
 Its never too late to realize 
 Thats just the way things are 
 Thats just the way it is now x2 
 I walk through the cemetery its all empty 
 Now I put a rose on the grave of a fallen hero 
 And I look out into the wild 
 All I see is emptiness so much loneliness 
 I just want forgiveness 
 When dreams fade away it wont be long 
 End up singing the same old song 
 What went right what went wrong 
 Bad times here good times gone 
 First rule  they always sell 
 Second rule  never tell 
 Third rule  straight to hell 
 White collar criminals living in jail 
 Its all that they gave 
 Sold your soul to get paid 
 But you end up in an early grave 
 Your own neck you cant save 
 Its a letter that you cant send 
 Its a wound that will never mend 
 Pain level peaks at ten 
 Some stand out some stand in 
 Thats just the way it is now x2This is where the good times went 
 With his brains lying on the pavement 
 With a broken bottle in his hand 
 And another in his back 
 Do you feel all right Oi Oi Oi 
 Someones gonna die tonight 
 Oi Oi Oi 
 The boys are out tonight 
 Was it something that he said 
 With his footballscarf now stained red 
 You will never understand 
 The boys are out tonightAlways outnumbered never outgunned

 Upon this land 
 Everywhere youre going 
 People they all suffer 
 Everybodys suffering 
 Let me go home 
 Upon this landThe phenomena you are about to witness 
 Could well revolutionize your way of thinking 
 We are presenting startling facts and evidence 
 That take up where explanations leave off 
 Some of these revelations will very well go against things you have been taught 
 And perhaps believed all your life 
 Prepare yourself for the evidence that will followLulu 
 Ah ah ah ah ah 
 Lulu 
 Where the middle class breaks up 
 The working class better wake up 
 When America was dreaming 
 Some pigs stole our country 
 Lulu stands by her family 
 With harmony and history 
 Theres two kinds of stories 
 Either comedy or tragedy 
 Lulu works all day long 
 She goes 9 to 5 just to stay alive 
 Shell do anything just to walk the line 
 Aint no time to wine and dine 
 Her war time now in the USA 
 Her husband goes far away 
 Afghanistan to Iraq 
 Her husband now aint comin back 
 America the beautiful 
 Thats what the sign said 
 And I welcome every single one 
 Cause I want them all to stay 
 And Ill travel and Ill travel 
 Til my very last day 
 Through the New York harbor 
 To the San Francisco bay 
 Lulu Lulu Lulu LuluThats not clear whats this for where or when was the liquor store 
 Stuck it in some fucked up kid stayin here and not musclin 
 I seem to spray paint jet spray on the brick wall 
 An I always remember how he said Lonely no More 
 I say Thats only entertainment 
 Sometimes you need something need to turn it off 
 I went to college Im no proper knowledge 
 Ive seen the spray paint jet spray on the brick wall 
 Ill always remember how he said Lonely no more 
 Said liquor stores fucked the American prices 
 I said time never stopped stopped in front of me 
 He shared three pieces of wisdom 
 Ill always remember how he said 
 Lonely no more 
 I said Thats only entertainment 
 I say Thats only entertainment dopeThis place is a tale of terror 
 This place is a ghost town now 
 This place has lost its people 
 This place has lost its charm 
 The coals on the fire aint burnin no more 
 In the lake shore foundries 
 The workers misled by corporations 
 That knows no boundaries 
 This place is a tale of terror 
 The land of liberty has been betrayed by 
 The monster corporations 
 The monster wont stop til 
 It lays waste to everything 
 This place 
 This placeKristine with the wild grin in the future with the world to end 
 Youll leave my heart broken then one thousand times again 
 Kristine with the wild grin in the future with the world to end 
 The cops will come out when the sun goes down 
 From dawn to dusk while we give up the town 
 With the closest walk they dont make a sound 
 Got the baddest of the bad arent coming around 
 The street is wicked and its wild and its free 
  Fucker heresy 
 You dont hit the top man where you want to be 
 Its a long way to go and its a one way street 
 You aint got nothing when you born to lose 
 Your heart filled up with the filth and the booze 
 Standing on the street corner singing the blues 
 The end of the world is the popular tune 
 The citys hot but you cooled it off 
 The city block is another war zone 
 The city kids aint got no home 
 Hit me a brick and well all get stoned 
 In the streets youre never alone 
 In the streets youre never aloneHold your head up high 
 Cause tomorrow you may die 
 Cause no ones safe around here 
 No ones safe around here 
 Stand your ground 
 Till youre the last one in town 
 Someone that you trust turned out to be a tricker 
 Smoking cigarettes getting stoned on liquor 
 Getting really dizzy only getting sicker 
 Small problems now only seem bigger 
 Americas a safe place 
 If youre gonna leave it 
 And the rhetoric is there 
 If youre gonna read it 
 And the hollow masses 
 The machines defeated 
 And the rich look down to arrive on the bleeding 
 Hold your head up high 
 Hardly enough 
 It gets tough when youre running 
 So you bust out the homeless 
 When they start coming 
 In LA Broadway its wicked when theyre watching 
 And your backup and your backup and your backup aint working 
 Theres no food so youre spurred into action 
 Set up and go to no satisfaction 
 Ice and snow is the city passion 
 When you walk in the shadows girl theres no protection 
 Cause theres no one safe around here 
 Skin head Rob 
 OK well 
 This is the city of Los Angeles 
 And it never sleeps 
 It may look like it 
 But it doesnt 
 It lives and breathes nocturnally 
 So when youve got no place to sleep at night 
 And youre all huddled up 
 And youre cold 
 Well this song goes out to the citys forgotten 
 Hey Tim take us on home 
 Underlying reason well she cant keep it going 
 In the middle of the night 
 They found her frozen 
 And the WalMart sign 
 Keeps on glowing 
 And the winds of change keep on blowing 
 Till youre the last one in townReconciled to the belief consumed in sacred ground for me 
 There wasnt always a place to go 
 But there was always an urge a need to belong 
 All these bands and all these people 
 All these friends and we were equals but 
 Whatcha gonna do when everybody goes on without you 
 To the end to the end Ill journey to the end 
 To the end yeah 
 Started in 87 ended in 89 
 You got a garage or an amp well play anytime 
 It was just the 4 of us yea man the core of us 
 Too much attention unavoidably destroyed us 
 Four kids on tour 3000 miles 
 In a four door car not knowing what was going on 
 Not if we got a billion years it would turn out like this 
 Hell no no premonition could have seen this 
 Matty came from far away 
 From New Orleans then into the East Bay 
 He said this is a mecca 
 I said this aint no mecca man this place is fucked 
 Three months go by he had no home 
 He had no food hes all alone 
 Matty said fool me once shame on you 
 He said fool me twice he went back to New Orleans 
 To the end to the end Ill journey to the endI figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You didnt see us comin now theres nothin you can do 
 Times are gonna change change or step aside 
 Its my point of view that took you by surprise 
 The suns comin up yeah the new dawn arrives 
 New generation standing stand with anger in their eyes 
 No love in the city cause theres no connection 
 Been stricken with disease a racial infection 
 Im a battering ram comin through to you 
 In every alleyway on every avenue 
 Actions could erase all the fear that we suffer 
 People segregated no one understands each other 
 Hes a different color but were the same kid 
 I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his 
 Well an eye for an eye yeah a tooth for a tooth 
 Brother against brother should be singin with the group 
 The inner cities burnin yeah its screamin black and blue 
 The power and the passion of a million youth 
 I figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You dint see us comin now theres nothin you can do 
 All the blood that spills of all the guts that fly 
 The media paints a picture that stands 
 Pits dogs against cats now who is responsible 
 The power in the issue 
 The force is unstoppableI went to Mary 
 Far to too long 
 Jubilee was cold as fuck 
 Why do they make it that cold 
 Stand aside while she 
 Picked me for you 
 For the time you gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 I seen you finish 
 I saw you at the start 
 I remember you straight from my heart 
 Youd ask me and Id say Whatd you say 
 You gave me your heart and then youre taking it 
 You gave it awayWho wouldve thought that dreams come true 
 Who wouldve thought Id end up with you 
 Who wouldve thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming through 
 Sihlouettes of palm trees backing up against the sky 
 Echo park sunset an ambulance drives by 
 Someone went down and I wonder who 
 Faces fall through was it anybody I knew 
 So I drank like a fish till I crawl like a rat 
 In the city of shit I ended up on my back 
 But I cant believe youre with me after dark 
 So let it come together in echo park 
 Who wouldve thought that dreams come true 
 A red flag and your body wins 
 Or a snake bite gotta start again 
 So Im fucked up and watching TV all day 
 I dont wanna see what ricky lakes gotta say 
 And it hits me when Im alone Im an angry man 
 I start singing to myself I got dealt a shitty hand 
 With all these feelings my heart could explode 
 So is it not fear no not at all 
 And I said 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming throughGo 
 Ahahah 
 East Timor 
 Got two they want to set examples down below 
 Emperors gonna use some of that thought control 
 And I can hear the voices 
 Propaganda clogging generations choices 
 Malicious productions of evil on high 
 Frustrates Timors breath 
 They aint gonna learn 
 A misguided hated measure 
 Against a backdrop of wartorn weather 
 Whispering

 Hope youre quite prepared to die 
 Looks like were in for nasty weather 
 One eye is taken for an eye 
 Theres a bad moon on the riseYangon Sule Pagoda hasnt seen since 88 
 Burmas bloody crackdown killing many in the hate 
 Peaceful Buddhist monks soldiers in the hunt 
 Left the bodies in the jungle to be eaten by the lake 
 Oil and Opium 
 The poor have been beaten upside down 
 Bullets are applied to the people who arise 
 Burning stinging tear gas hits you right between the eyes 
 Soldiers locked and loaded this countrys been exploited 
 Raid the monasteries and silence the debate 
 The poor have been beaten upside downYeah yeah 
 The ladies on the corner selling extacy 
 Theyre dressed in fancy get ups like in porno magazines 
 Minors in the disco takes his first drink 
 Cops on the lawn waitin for the kids to leave 
 Willey knew the Brothels Willey had the speed 
 Willey had the friends that had everything you need 
 We have everything you need 
 And when I first did him I knew that he was tough 
 And not to my surprise he really liked it rough

 And I know Im indestructibletonightAnother East Bay night 
 East Bay night 
 When the sun goes down and the night come around 
 And the fog come arolling in 
 When you cast a line to go dance one time 
 And an old friend invites you in 
 Hear a punk rock song and we sing along 
 Everything gonna be all right 
 Another East Bay night 
 Well Granma stands on the very same land 
 On the old house up on the hill 
 You can see the San Francisco Bay Alcatraz Albany landfill 
 And reminisce on the front porch under a yellow light 
 Earthquakes shake and fires take from this view 
 Ive seen it all Ive tasted smoke as the hills burned 
 I heard the freeway fall when theres nothing to say 
 Just look into the bay 
 You know some things they just feel right 
 East Bay nightShe gonna go 
 She gonna seek and destroy 
 She gonna split 
 With the whole damn scene 
 Make a run cause some rebellion 
 Hustle some cash with the danger eyes 
 Repeat 
 Danger eyes 
 I know 
 She go 
 Shes got danger eyes 
 Shes got the danger eye 
 Well an eminent threat boy loose in the corner 
 Lets start over stay clean she said 
 Ideology is the  
  Psychobillys 
  Through over there 
 Scandalous victorious is no longer  
 Odds are only to her dismay 
 Raise up  
 She gonna go 
  Its a whole new night 
 She had a dream of a 60 foot devil dancing 
 Saw a blue sky open hands 
 Some got guns he used life as a weapon 
 Another twilight on the very next  
 An explosive frown  
 That it definitely holds you hostage 
 While death he comes so primitive 
 Shes got the dangerous eyesI saw  a new generationcoming 
 Under  the smoke over Oakland 
 In and out  the streets are breathing 
 Chaos disorder looting and loiter 
 From a blind man praying for some silence  for some silence 
 Take a loot on the moon not a foot in the room 
 My best intentions always ended in a fight  in a fight 
 You can send me to hell expose me Ill tell 
 Just take control and say what theyre doing  what theyre doing 
 Twofifty dead the tribune read Oaklands going off like a bomb 
 I saw  a new generation coming 
 Armageddon is coming so yeah you better start running 
 Cause the big wave is coming to the shore  to the shore 
 No surprise that you see through the lies 
 Of a system rotten to the core  to the core 
 High tech surveillance paranoia and violence 
 Keeping the city at a calm  at a calm 
 Man it just dont seem right 
 You see every time I turn I around its just the same story and its like 
 It just dont seem right and I wonder is it gonna endHit it 
 Knocking down the doors slogans on the walls 
 One said fight back yeah the system will falL 
 The police came out with tear gas and flames 
 Chaos in the city beating them at the game 
 Dont pay the poll tax the headlines read 
 Thirty cops beaten another one dead 
 The fight lasted on through the Brixton night 
 A thousand angry looters who knew they were right 
 Under  the smoke over OaklandLady Liberty come down and bleed for me 
 I want nothing to do with your crazy world 
 Broken promises so full of nonsense 
 Are blanketed by the time 
 I was all abandoned and alone 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanista 
 Lady Liberty come down and bleed on me 
 You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold 
 Some tenderness then the cold hits 
 And then I come to find that the streets arent paved at all 
 From the Kremlin to Afghanistan to our forgotten homes 
 The orphans in confusion to discharged refugees 
 In the fields of poison ivy through the famine and disease 
 You bled my loyalty 
 Lady Liberty come down and bleed for me 
 Oh youre telling me not to worry About the shortcomes of lies 
 And the high cost of living 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanistaHey hey hey hey 
 Come into the union district 
 Drive down on Sharmon Palms 
 White ghettos paint a picture 
 Broken homes and broken bones 
 I was so full of scotch I could not stand up 
 I was hittin the shots and I moved to a cup 
 Release me from moral assumption 
 Total rejection total destruction 
 Nihilistic feelings are movin 
 If you try really hard 
 Youll see right through them 
 Nihilism nihilism nihilism nihilism 
 Drive down in Sharmon Palms 
 Raking a path of self destruction 
 Not affected by the repercusions 
 Lady in the billboard offer me a drink 
 Said not right now I need time to think 
 If I try real hard 
 Ill see right through them 
 Nihilism 
 Nihilism I was so full of scotch I could not stand up 
 Nihilism I was hittin the shots and I moved to a cup

 And her nerves are shot 
 And she starts to rot from the inside out 
 She said I dont need you to save me 
 But theres people here trying to play me 
 And theres no jobs that will pay me 
 Enough to feed my family 
 And I got my back up against the wall 
 And no one hears the call 
 Cause theres no one there at all 
 Alarm clock ringin 
 Fools are trippin 
 Promises broken yeah jobs are leavin 
 And the sky is darkenin 
 And the landlords steppin 
 But the bus be splittin

 To the graveyard shift tonight 
 Under the red hot moon 
 KCs from Campbell California 
 Shes got a reputation 
 That she didnt ask for 
 And shes waiting for an escape 
 Now that escape is called the 164 
 Now KC she wont admit 
 Where she is from 
 And KC she wants 
 To run run run 
 Shes a punk rocker 
 She dont trust no one 
 On a South Bay bus all alone 
 KC was never caught up like 
 The rest of the rats 
 In a fuckin maze 
 Check me out she said 
 Im in a concrete jungle 
 Im an individual and 
 You are stuck in a haze 
 Oh hell no 
 She knows where the truth is 
 Cause she said so 
 And she knows who her friends are 
 So fuck you dont get no closer 
 Itll only make her run far away 
 I knew KCs brother pretty well 
 Lets say we spent alot 
 Of time hangin out 
 I always thought he said 
 That shed be the one 
 To get outta here and 
 Make a life for herself 
 But when we found her 
 In the little league park 
 In the dugouts it was 
 Cold damp and dark 
 And no one knew why 
 She wouldnt wake up 
 I think she finally 
 Made it back home 
 Skinhead Robs part 
 One time for your mind 
 Two times for your soul 
 Three for the graveyards 
 And the money I fold 
 Dipped out in the city 
 Where the sun burns slow 
 No hope its a pity 
 I cant say no 
 Its not my time to go 
 Its not my time to die 
 The last thing I want 
 Is for my mother to cry 
 It was love at first light 
 The very first night 
 Things have never been the same 
 Since I took my first flight 
 The way I live my life 
 I love I live lavish 
 Lost me from the start 
 You lose youll never have this 
 Untouched unleashed 
 Back up you dont want it 
 Stick him for his cash 
 His bad its how he flaunt it 
 Take two and pass 
 Ill take two and blast 
 Bust a mother fucker 
 Im out on the smash 
 Dipped out high as fuck 
 Im outta control 
 Lets bounce rock skate 
 Man Im ready to roll 
 Under the red hot moonGrave digger digging all the way down 
 Grave digger digging all the way down 
 Digging all way down to the underground 
 Well youre born into money with your legacy out 
 You move through the darkness with no sense of sound 
 When your body feels alive when you sleep under the soul 
 You wake up your heart aches your black in your hole 
 Well you prey on the weak who are trying to survive 
 You jump on the backbone thats keeping you alive 
 Well youre the master of your destiny the  blitz of light 
  In your veins and malice in your eyes 
 You prey on the weak who try to survive 
 Digging all way down to the underground1234 
 I saw an old man on the street 
 He was in a dumpster looking for something to eat 
 He moved so slow like a dying dream 
 Like a machinist who got caught in the machine 
 I saw this lady and she was crying 
 She said its hard when someone you love is dying 
 I saw this kid whos about five years old 
 He was in the park all alone he was cold 
 Theres somethine coming around 
 As wicked as it may seem 
 As wicked as anything may be 
 As wicked as anything could be 
 I know this girl shes barely alive 
 Shes all haggard shes only twentyfive 
 She said she never had a friend before 
 I said Hey girl Ill be your friend but who is keeping score 
 I saw this other little girl on the phone 
 Her mothers comforting her from far far from home 
 The little girls very hesitant 
 Her best friend lie dead on the pavement 
 Theres something coming around 
 As wicked as it may seem 
 Nah nah nah yeah 
 I always end up back on the hill

 I caught I caught 
 A glimpse I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 I was jolted I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 One that stops and launches and explosion 
 I caught a glimpse of things to come 
 It falls on you and then it it falls on me 
 Outside the church the streets are wet 
 Its a half past three 
 Well ya ya get your moves all steady 
 Cause no good is up again 
 Mortally wounded the one on the front seat 
 Its the beginning of the end 
 And ah 
 God bless the dead and the family and friends 
 I caught a glimpse of things to comeWithin the same school The idea was that wed later combine both styles 
 Unify the techniques 
 But still we were too young 
 Too full of ignorant pride in our own succulent sorrow 
 Oh no 
 Some people live illegal 
 What you got you cant keep here 
 All their lives are led in evil  Oh they rise a lot of evil  
 Open the jails and set the men free 
 Well the devils and witches are looming on me 
 And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery 
 A decision of descention into insanity 
 Humility will hold you and never let you go 
 To all my friends well much gratitude 
 And to all the wicked Ive got my eyes on you 
 And everyone stands in confusion 
 To do the job youve got to prepare yourself to die die die 
 Put em up put em in run em out run quicker 
 Cool to the breath and quicker than liquor 
 Quicker than any motherfucker that I know 
 Rack em up and stomp em wherever hell go

 Some citys born some cities burn 
 Some cities die some cities Learn 
 Some cities take the worst of the turn 
 And if it aint your business 
 Then its not your concern 
 Listen brick buildings 
 Broken windows smoke stacks 
 Tell me somethings broken 
 And theres blood tracks 
 And if you see the train coming 
 Youre gonna relax 
 So tell the facts maam only the facts 
 Stand down what you gonna do 
 Shes a wild one 
 Im a wild one too 
 Shes my gogo baby 
 She dances on a pole x2 
 Midnight and Im rolling on 
 Nobody sees me coming home 
 And out here man a lot of things can go wrong 
 Shhh listen to my song 
 The morgue is busy day after day 
 Stick it on the line and throw it away 
 And if you see it coming on then you got it made 
 And the grave diggers laugh as they rot and decay 
 Say it loud 
 What you gonna do 
 And Im a wild one too 
 Im a wild one 
 Im a wild oneTheres a place where 
 Where I like to go 
 When I got no food 
 Or I got no shelter 
 Its a house where I can 
 Get away for maybe three days 
 To get off the drink 
 And stay off the haze 
 Whos the opposition 
 Im seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah Im down down down 
 Woke up in the bushes 
 630 Tuesday morning 
 With a unopened Heineken 
 And a head that was burning 
 For seven years I walked 
 Down the same path 
 Dreams of being loved 
 Was all I ever had 
 Lets go 
 Down on Fifth Avenue 
 Kids smoking crack and drinking 
 They say I dont belong here 
 Fuck you Mohican 
 They call me a faggot 
 And they shove me out 
 But I dont give a fuck 
 I never did 
 BlahHangin out with Lars down on 6th Street 
 He knew I was in trouble 
 I was feeling much like the devil 
 There was something burnin deep inside of me 
 Ran into three Puerto Ricans 
 These girls took us to the funhouse 
 Where we played a lonely pinball machine 
 Hangin on the corner of 52nd and Broadway 
 Cars passin by but none of them seem to be goin my way 
 New York City  well I wish I was on a highway 
 Back to Olympia 
 Im having a hard time understanding 
 It gets all too demanding 
 Shes all gone and Im stranded 
 Something burning deep inside of me 
 All I know its 4oclock and 
 She aint never showed up 
 And I watched a thousand people go home from work 
 How many times will it take me 
 Before I go crazy 
 Before I lose everything 
 Those girls took us to the funhouse 
 I dont wanna be alone again 
 Cars passin by but none of them seem to go my way 
 New York City well I wish I was on the highway 
 Back to OlympiaYeah Are you ready for this I told you he was coming GO 
 These bands call anywhere living in 66 
 I made so many mistakes when I look back it makes me sick 
 Those days are dead and gone and they aint ever coming back 
 I realize that in life it aint free 
 I got so many troubles it brings me to my knees 
 Those days are dead and gone and they aint ever coming back1987 at a 711 
 Police out looking for problems 
 But Im no average hoodlum 
 Still running from the pigs 
 So it seems to me this is not 
 The land of love and liberty 
 Its more like a waiting room in hell 
 Drink a qwart and watch me dwell 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonight 
 Glass towers rise above the filth and the pain 
 Im a moral degenerate feel my pain 
 Pass out in a squat on mission 
 That night I was shocked into submission 
 Straight down straight down to hell I head 
 Systems of sewers is where I lay my head 
 People on their way are like on a different dimension 
 I need no correction 
 Some of my friends moved on a simple domestic life 
 They磖e all gone only a few of us remain 
 Only few of us want to keep in the same 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonightThe way that she moves 
 Well I was aroused impowered impassioned by every move 
 Its so cold outside we need a place to hide 
 Go into the club to thaw out for the night 
 Shes automatic so automatic 
 The way that she moves the way that she moves 
 The way she moves 
 The situation was tricky I was feeling so proud 
 The bass and the drums the music so loud 
 She asked me if I would stand by her side 
 And I knew that I would till the end of the night 
 My head was spinnin a million miles an hour 
 The chance I was takin I get anxious around her 
 She put her head on my shoulder I started to hold her 
 Swingin and swayin the morning began 
 I say the way she moves yeah 
 I say the way she movesShes got her ticket  shes waitin at the station 
 Shes got to get away get away as far as she can 
 Her problems will arise as sure as the sun does shine 
 Shes got to get used to living on the lam 
 Now Marys out the door with a loaded 44 in her hand 
 Shootin down the law that shot down her dear departed man 
 When I last saw her she was lookin troubled 
 She said this is the 90s Im gonna be alright 
 She took the Greyhound into Salinas 
 I got a letter then she dropped out of sight 
 Shrouded in anger 
 Encompassed by pain 
 He was your best friend  youll never ever ever see him again 
 Now Marys out the door with a loaded 44 in her handOn the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 Its the lonely asshole with a glimmer of life 
 With the kill all the life 
 Killer dont care 
 Kill were not going 
 Destroying anywhere 
 Kill the lights kill the lights 
 Im gonna breakout Im gonna throw down 
 Cause I already hate you 
 Its just gonna drag me down 
 On the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 BlahIn the dark with the okland skyline 
 As I cross the city I avoid the landlines 
 All I wanna do is make it through without dying 
 All I wanna do is keep on trying 
 Another night 
 In the streets for me 
 No sanctuary 
 Come and watch me bleed 
 She wouldnt move until the coast was clear 
 She always knew the final battle was near 
 If you have a bag of dope she give it up for free 
 If you got a song of hope it will help her see 
 In the streets for mePick me back up just to throw me back down apoogies too like when youre up 
 Against the wall compassion heals while duplicity kills you say Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you You moved up the ladder 
 At a very rapid speed we mived methodically and calmly when you got to the top 
 You see enemies if I knew back then what I know that it would all turn out 
 Like this Id sit back and Id watch you squirm cause you say Im different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about youGo to work go to scool 
 Get an education so you wont be a fool 
 Get a doctorate PhD 
 All that shit is not for me 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life live it my own way 
 Was so blind I couldnt see 
 Figures of authority 
 Always standing behind me 
 Ready to come down on me 
 This is my life live it my own wayNever fell in love til I fell in love with you 
 Never knew what a good time was til I had a good time with you 
 If you wanna get the feelin  you wanna get it right 
 Then the musics gotta be loud 
 For when the music hits I feel no pain at all 
 Ya know 
 One summer night I was drinkin with my dad 
 He tried to give me love that I never had 
 But he gave more love to his bottle of wine 
 So I had to go out and find love of another kind 
 Here it is 
 Here I am 
 Turn it up fuckin loud 
 Radio radio radio radio radio radio radio 
 When I got the music I got a place to go 
 Radio clash magnificent 7 
 I was a choir boy you showed me no heaven 
 Two tools surely lost 
 No remorse ignoring the cost 
 Doncha know 
 Well I got a place well I got a place well I got a place to go 
 When I got the music I got a place to goLike Chaucers 
 Canterbury Tales 
 When three men find a pot of gold 
 And end up killing one another in the name of greed 
 Some people are poison 
 Under my skin like opium 
 Ill stare in their eye to annoy them 
 Well theyre poison yeah theyre poison 
 Admissions of liabilities 
 Im livin in my own private cold war 
 In a room full of spies 
 And I cant find the door 
 The violent aspects of the tattered man 
 Let me respond to that if I can 
 Illuminated manuscripts written by hand 
 Accusations have been made from the very beginning 
 Yeah their fuckin poisonYeah 
 Heres the new face of rocknroll 
 Its about fightin toe to toe 
 Hard times come 
 Yeah the hard times go 
 When I say come one come all 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 One mans decision 
 Brings anothers opposition 
 Completely unbound 
 Down on the flats 
 Where the seaside meets 
 My lonely young town 
 Well all the rudies and skins 
 Well theyre out on the streets 
 Making the way on the grill 
 Between the bottles and sex 
 They smash and they wreck 
 For something to live 
 Sometimes you know theres no place to go 
 But to a long life of crime 
 Yeah but its so wrong to steal 
 Someones very last meal 
 To profit up a dime 
 Your poe poes and greys 
 Well they end up in jail 
 Gonna swing the cowboys 
 Well you took a bite 
 Outta the apple of decision 
 That got ya there boy 
 Hooligans and rudeboys 
 I dont want no racial hatred 
 Black and white who are portrayed without bias 
 These are the people whose voice I want to be 
 I said the hooligans 
 Rancid 
 Rudeboys 
 Hooligans 
 Rancid 
 Ah ah ahHe didnt see it comin until it was too late 
 He had a bad feelin cant hesitate 
 And at the end of the day he was so tired 
 And he looked at the television 
 And whose the fuckin liar 
 He hates society he thinks its to big 
 Its just about killin a man with his ring 
 And he knew what was happening millions in gold 
 Hes the first on the case and theres a murder to shoot 
 Bright lights here comes the night 
 Interrogate the kid with the 357 
 Im gonna  Im gonna blast em 
 Question the ethics right or wrong 
 Secret identity started so young 
 He never made friends ah dont get too close 
 For a man whos got nothin hes just got the mercy 
 His family never knows the truth 
 Cause he gets caught when he tells the truth 
 No friends to lose or time to betray 
 The rendition from the papers gonna bake him again 
 See through his eyes his eyes alone 
 Intensified anger cant be controlled 
 He turned his indiscretion he brought it all down 
 If there was ever force of reason it could never be found 
 The timing was perfect this kid he was cleared 
 Computers down hes clasped his fear 
 A different mind lives in a way 
 Its a good good thing that he got it straight 
 Im gonna  Im gonna blast em
