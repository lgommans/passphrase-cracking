About this planet there is something I know 
 Theres a very big difference between above and below 
 A friend foe or bro leave your body on the floor 
 Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow 
 Here above land man has laid his plan 
 And yes it does include the Ku Klux Klan 
 We got a government so twisted and bent 
 Bombs tanks and guns is how our money is spent 
 We got VD heroin greed and prostitution 
 Tension aggravation L Ron Hubbard solution 
 Not to mention hardcore chemical pollution 
 If you think youre just away youre in a mental institution 
 And thats a heart felt shame 
 Cause everyones crazy everyones the same 
 So why should only Larry Curly and Moe be to blame 
 Time now to take you to a different place 
 Where peace lovin whales flow through liquid outer space 
 A groovin and a gliddin as graceful as lace 
 A never losing touch with the oceans embrace 
 Diviner than the dolphin that there is none 
 Cause dolphins justa like to have a lot of fun 
 No one tells em how their life is run 
 And no one points at them with a gun 
 They have a lot of love for every living creature 
 The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature 
 They be movin in schools but everyones the teacher 
 Someday mister dolphin I know Im going to meet you 
 Back to the land of the policeman 
 Where he does whatever he says he can 
 Including hating you because youre a Jew 
 Or beating black ass thats nothing new 
 Trigger happy cops they just like to brawl 
 They use guns clubs gas but thats not all 
 They got pukeridden prisons and sexsick jails 
 Fuck the poor if youre rich you pay the bail 
 So support your police support your local wars 
 Thats the way to open economic doors 
 Why do we do it Cause the presidents a whore 
 We assume the position to sell the ammunition 
 What the fuck Its the American tradition 
 Along with going fishin apple pies in the kitchen 
 Isnt it bitchin seeing dead men in ditchesWarlocks in wonderland Ive got a 
 Megatropolis in my hand and a 
 Subterranean marching band that making noise for the boys in the Vatican and a 
 Little package and off we go oh tickyticky tackety tictactoe I know 
 Everybodys an Eskimo weve got another thing coming and thats our show well 
 Every night I go looking for you 
 Everyone in the world adores you 
 A little packet of something kind to find your reason 
 Coming up on it every day for 
 Look at me and its what I stay for 
 A little locket of fantasy that we believe in 
 Lilacs and contraband Ive got 
 Santa Monica in my hand a little 
 Beatlemania when I can Ive got 
 Two big bags of old Japan oh 
 Ring side and blowbyblow another 
 Main event at the old rainbow were coming 
 Right on top of the tupelo when she looks just like Bridgette Bardot 
 Make a deal with Uncle Weezer 
 Sign your name to claim 
 ChiChina Chow will try to please her 
 Sweetness came from Jane 
 Warlocks in wonderland Ive got a 
 Rockapotamus in my hand with a 
 Happy ending thats made of sand 
 With a little bit of loving is all I plan 
 A little packet of something kind yo find your reason 
 A little locket of fantasy that we believe in nowClose to my skin Im falling in someone whos been 
 Sittin by the phone Im left alone in another zone 
 John says to live above hell and my will is well 
 No one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail yeah 
 Its such a waste to be wasted in the first place 
 I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace 
 To meditate on the warmest dream 
 And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme 
 Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen 
 Somebody close that can see right through 
 Id take a fall and you know that Id do anything 
 I will for you 
 Sailin for the sun cause ththere is one that knows where Im from 
 I care for you I really do I really do 
 Come closer now so you can lie right by my side 
 Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you Im getting over myself yeah 
 Somebody close that was made for you 
 Close to my skin someone whos been Ima falling in 
 Disasters are just another star falling in my yard 
 Long to be with someone to tell I love your smellI stole your haircut and 
 Your balling personality 
 The perfect pallet for 
 A painting of morality 
 And now I come across without 
 A loss of what to be 
 Add up the two of us and 
 Then subtract the one of me 
 Come meet your maker 
 A different kind of strain 
 Ill turn you into one and 
 Then Ill turn you out for fun 
 Older than days and age 
 In fact you never were that young 
 Decended from a line 
 Of endless oppotunities 
 Ill build a mountain will 
 You bring it down and ruin it please 
 A sweet super tiger 
 Wont it be great 
 We could all do 
 What ever we want 
 What 
 Ever we want to 
 Im dreaming up the thing 
 That no one ever knew was love 
 Ill get your higher than the 
 Hawks of Hollywood above 
 Its up for grabs the ragged 
 String of possibilites 
 To walk away from this could 
 Leave me feeling ill at ease 
 We could all to 
 Ever we want toOn the corner into my car 
 I drive forever never get far 
 The 45 is slowly getting loaded 
 I send another song to my star 
 California mountains in the mornin 
 Stitch it up and get it all 
 All along the womans got a want it 
 We all walk your pavement get it off 
 Take more than your 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 A pendulum inside of my bed 
 Swingin low I hope to get hit 
 The overflow is slow but not enough no 
 Another drop will never fix it 
 Get along and get it all 
 We all walk your pavement get if off 
 Take more than your friends 
 If I call you lately 
 I could be your man 
 I could be your greatness 
 I shut it down the look in my eyes 
 Knock em dead a covered in flies 
 The big sleep without a bed of roses 
 The light of day will never tell lies 
 We all walk your pavement 
 On the river into my dock 
 I paddle thought the shadow and fog 
 To ponder all of those who came before me 
 Another piece for building my archI think Ill go on a walkabout 
 And find out what its all about 
 And that aint hard 
 Just me and my own two feet 
 In the heat Ive got myself to meet 
 A detective of perspective 
 I need to try to get a bigger eye 
 Open wide 
 Bloodwood flowers in my gaze 
 Walkabout in a sunny days 
 Do me now 
 On a walkabout 
 You could do it in the city 
 You could do it in a zone 
 You could do it in desert 
 You could do the unknown 
 High desert skies are what I spy 
 So fly  you gotta wonder why 
 The stingrays must be fat this year 
 Im moving slow in my lowest gear 
 The digirido original man with a dream 
 I believe the Aborigine 
 You could do it with a shuffle 
 You could do it with a stroll 
 You could do it with a stride 
 A walk could cure most all my blues 
 Bare feet or in my two shoes 
 One two 
 I think Ill go on a walkabout 
 Use your legs to rock it wide 
 Take a ride to the other sideThe freakiest show I know is the show of my own 
 Living my life in and out of the twilight zone 
 Bust my britches bless my soul 
 Im a freak of nature walking totem pole 
 Look and see I think youll agree 
 Nobody weird like me 
 Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me 
 Hell bent on inventing a new species 
 Riding down the path on the back of a giraffe 
 Me and the giraffe laughed cause I passed some gas 
 Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream 
 Well everything is never just as it seems 
 The freakiest show I know is the show of my own 
 Living my life in and out of the twilight zonePumping the blood through the heart of New Orleans 
 Shes the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream 
 Shes just made out of flesh and bones 
 But let me tell you little boy you better leave her alone 
 Leroy Brown thought he was bad too 
 Till she left him floating in the old bayou 
 Shes the kind of girl shes built like a bomb 
 Shes the blackeyed blackeyed blackeyed blonde get down 
 That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch 
 French electric sexacock shocking swamp fox 
 Heaten queen of sleaze shes hot to box 
 But let me tell you little boy shell clean your clock 
 A slick and sly spy stuck in the muck of the moat 
 Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat 
 Doubleodooms day for Mr James Bond 
 Shes the blackeyed blackeyed blackeyed blonde get downWhen will it come around 
 The wind that will inspire 
 When will it make a sound 
 The sound I desire 
 Cause we all need something to do 
 A certain something thats true 
 Floating upstream Ive seen 
 The spider and the snake 
 A trip without pause when 
 I saw my mistake 
 All my life I have known who I am 
 A troubled man but I stand 
 All my life I have seen what it means 
 To be myself in this dream 
 A certain someone thats youI was riding 
 Riding on my bike 
 Me with my friend 
 Were so alike 
 Am I all alone 
 She said all we 
 Have is this 
 We just had to stop 
 And share a kiss 
 One hot minute 3x 
 And Im in it come and get it 3x 
 If I chase it 
 I might waste it 
 Come and get it 
 Sitting in the fire 
 Get along and have some fun 
 Floating to be higher 
 Maybe Im your special one 
 Silent testifier 
 Breathe the moon 
 And eat the sun 
 Close your eyes 
 And click your heels 
 Can you believe 
 How good it feels 
 One hot minute x3 
 And Im in it come and get it 
 If a chase it I might waste it 
 A tiny wink is all 
 All we have 
 No its not much more 
 But dont get mad 
 Three lbs of love 
 Inside my skull 
 A million more lives 
 Its never drill 
 Just a few times spun 
 Spun around the sun 
 A couple more or less 
 And then were doneThe crimson tide is flowing through 
 Your fingers as you sleep 
 The promise of a clean regime 
 Are promises we keep 
 Do you like it rough I ask 
 And are you up to task 
 The calicos of Pettibon 
 Where cultures come to clash 
 Several of my best friends wear 
 The colors of the crown 
 And Mary wants to build it up 
 And Sherri wants to tear it all back down girl 
 The savior of your light 
 The monarchy of roses 
 The monarchy of roses tonight 
 The cross between my former queen 
 Her legendary stare 
 The holy tears of Ireland 
 A lovely cross to bear 
 Several of my best friends know 
 The secrets of this town 
 And Mary wants to raise it up 
 And Sherri wants to spin it all around girl 
 The sailors of the night 
 Hey 
 We all want the rose you know 
 I said hey 
 Show us love before you go 
 Say I will then say I want to 
 The story knows that I will never taunt you 
 The story knows that I will always haunt you 
 HeyWell my friend Bobs in jail today 
 His girlfriend is too 
 For stealing change for gasoline 
 Nothing to do but rue 
 Destroy the bruise  
 Cause there will never be another one just like you no 
 Bob 
 I met him on the boulevard Hollywood and Vine 
 He said Youre gonna be a superstar 
 I said Thats fine sublime 
 He loved my crime 
 But there will never be another one just like you no 
 Bob 
 I never see you 
 Something something all through the night 
 Blackest flag at dawn 
 A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong thats wrong 
 Please be lifelong 
 Killing yourself that would be an awesome oath 
 This song is so far away  
 Remember the home and how they left us alone  
 Remember our friendship 
 Stealing everything in the store 
 You know I want you to stay 
 Friends fade away 
 Well my friend Bobs insane today 
 I know I am too 
 The mental patients laugh and cry 
 BobWelcome friends to my thoughts of when 
 The fax city 4 were four young men 
 Time has come and now we jam 
 With the uplift mofo party plan 
 Were the organic antibeat box band 
 One comes from the Holy Land 
 Another was born an Australian 
 Me Im from Michigan 
 But Hollywood is the land of lands 
 Its a Hollywood jam 
 We represent the Hollywood kids 
 Hollywood is where we live 
 We represent the Hollywood jam 
 Organic antibeat box band 
 Life is grand in the land of lands 
 The mind does boggle the mind expands 
 The anarchy 4 have manned their craft 
 Get on your knees and shake your ass 
 To the jam that is 
 We dont ask we demand 
 That you and your clan 
 Listen now to this jam 
 To the power of the drummer cause the drummer is bad 
 Theres a party in my town at 1200 
 Theres a party thats rockin down to the rock 
 Ive got nothin against hip hop 
 But theres a party in my town 
 And no beat box 
 Jam that is 
 The partys got girls the girls got hot 
 The partys got boys and the boys got socks 
 Something popped the doors unlocked 
 House got up ran around the block 
 Sit down house 
 Take off your blouse 
 Any good friend of the lollypop kids 
 Over the rainbow with the wizz 
 With the organic antibeat box band 
 You just might slam 
 Dance that is 
 Its a Hollywood jamWell I was not created in the likeness of a fraud 
 Your hell is something scary I prefer a loving god 
 We are not the center of this funny universe 
 And what is worse I do not serve in fear of such a 
 Curse 
 Shallow be thy game 2000 years look in the mirror 
 You play the game of shame you tell your people live in fear 
 A rival to the way you see the Bible let him be 
 Im a threat to your survival and your control company 
 Youll never burn me 
 I will be your heretic 
 You cant contain me 
 I am the power free 
 Truth belongs to everybody 
 To anyone whos listening youre not born into sin 
 The guilt they try and give you puke it in the nearest bin 
 Missionary madness sweep up culture with a broom 
 Trashing ancient ways is par for the course its 
 Fucking rude 
 To think that youre above the laws of nature what a joke oh 
 Purple sashes feeding masses smoke on which to choke 
 Well I might be a monkey when it comes to being holy 
 Fundamental hatred get down on your knees and 
 Oh yeah 
 I was not created in the likeness of a fraud 
 Truth belongs to everybody x2Someone spilled blood many years ago 
 Someone spilled blood but do you know 
 That from the backwoods 
 Where the Chuck Berries grow 
 Come your long tall 
 Daddies of a rock and roll 
 Take me to your backwoods now 
 Spinning down from the clouds 
 Like a tornado 
 Spinnin out of control 
 Like a psychedelic soul 
 With a rhythm hittin harder 
 Than Larry Holmes 
 Daddies of rock and roll 
 Mr Uplift Mofo  my man Bo Diddley 
 Hit sippin a bottle of nickel ripple 
 Play the lickity split finger licking licks 
 For all you wicked city slick chicks 
 And all you nitty gritty hick 
 Well make your nipples ripple 
 Make you wanna dip your dipple 
 Make you wanna soak your hickory stick 
 Thats right 
 Because my man has a grip on it 
 And I do mean on it 
 Which brings to mind 
 A very sinister minister kind of guy 
 A man named Little Richard 
 Who was born to make them bitches stir 
 Thats right hell make the sweet substance drip 
 From the middle of your hillbilly lips 
 And like the farmer milks his cow 
 The Howling Wolf will howl 
 And since times does allow 
 You all can take me to your backwoods now 
 Take me to your backwoodsThey come from every state to find 
 Some dreams were meant to be declined 
 Tell the man what did you have in mind 
 What have you come to do 
 No turning water into wine 
 No learning while youre in the line 
 Ill take you to the broken sign 
 You see these lights are blue 
 Come and get it lost it at the city limit 
 Say goodbye cause they will find a way to trim it 
 Everybody looking for a silly gimmick 
 Gotta get away cant take it for another minute 
 This town is made of many things 
 Just look at what the current brings 
 So high its only promising 
 This place was made on you 
 Tell me baby whats your story 
 Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw 
 Tell me lover are you lonely 
 The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw 
 Where do you come from and where you want to go this time aw 
 Youre so lovely are you lonely 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind 
 Some claim to have the fortitude 
 Too shrewd to blow the interlude 
 Sustaining pain to set a mood 
 Step out to be reviewed 
 Ill move you like a baritone 
 Jungle brothers on the microphone 
 Getting over with an undertone 
 Its time to turn to stone 
 Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty 
 Life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty 
 What a pity Boston and a Kansas City 
 Lookin for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty 
 Three fingers in the honeycomb 
 You ring just like a xylophone 
 Devoted to the chromosome 
 The day that you left home 
 Tell me baby whats your story 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind behind 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behindIt must have been your funny face 
 It must have been your love 
 Must have been your paper chase 
 That wasnt quite enough 
 Must have been your tiny dance that 
 Made me laugh out loud 
 Must have been your angel dust that 
 Put me on your cloud 
 Youre the reason why 
 Youre the reason I 
 It must have been your love I said 
 It must have been your love in a little bit 
 It must have been your poppy eyes 
 That made me step outside 
 It must have been the sight of tears that 
 Let me know I cried 
 It must have been your bunny shake 
 A lot of girls wont come around they 
 Treat me like a wolf 
 It must have been your love I gotta give it that 
 Youre my angel baby 
 Youre my darling 
 Youre my star 
 Lololololita 
 Let her see me deep in love 
 Youre my angel baby 
 Lopsided eyes and a crooked frown 
 Make more of life just settle down 
 Every single little princess needs a crown 
 It must have been your loveFloozies at the rainbow 
 Superstars that wont get far 
 Who is who that we know 
 Coochie Coo is at the bar 
 Do you really love 
 Do you love do you love 
 Do you want to make the call 
 We all long we all fall 
 Shoelace for the sirens 
 Groupies and the tyrants ply 
 Do you really want 
 Do you want do you want 
 Do you want to have it all 
 We all long we all fall 
 Im so tired 
 Well I get by 
 But I could use a few 
 That I slept 
 Along the way 
 A suitcase of perception 
 Rhinestones and redemption cries 
 The sun beats down 
 Upon my lonely face 
 Do you love do you chase 
 Do you take this town today 
 We all long we all face 
 And Im so tired 
 A perfect world 
 With all its perfect places 
 I could use a few 
 For just in cases 
 Along the wayYou are my god you are my dog 
 You kept me close love never lost 
 I called you hippie you said fuck off 
 Said your brothers a real punk rocker 
 Something gonna happen 
 Something very soon 
 Transcending flesh could be a breeze 
 Sending me oh over the Moon 
 Friends near death you gave respect 
 Sympathetic Intellect 
 Choices are for one and all 
 All we are is leaves that fall 
 Thats all 
 Always be loving you 
 Now Im away from you 
 Round and round inside your head 
 Smartest fucker I ever met 
 Vicious fish bit at your toes 
 Made you lie and numb your soul 
 Mule donkey ass you bore the load 
 Of all creations tortured souls 
 Choices are for one and all 
 All we are are leaves that fall 
 I like no other I love you youre my brother 
 Water flowing and I will drink it 
 I will drink for you 
 A part of me left that only you knew 
 Will never be understood 
 Hey gone to stay 
 Entire lifetime flash before me 
 In a loving stream 
 Hey mother may I have lost a child 
 But she gave birth 
 To a loving stream 
 Ooh never know 
 When the gods will come and 
 Take you 
 Ooh heart of gold 
 The most special things you gave me were 
 From your loving stream 
 Fuck the magazines 
 Fuck the green machine 
 See the human being 
 Fuck the legal greed 
 Fuck the nothing scene 
 See the family 
 In a loving streamYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Shes stone cold bush yeah 
 And baby thats alright 
 And thats alright with me 
 Get up off your knees come on walk with me 
 Tell me what you need to get along 
 A statue come to life I cut you with my knife 
 Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger 
 Shes stone cold bush 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Haight Street got nothing to show 
 Except the skirt on your ass 
 When youre living on the streets youve got to let it roll 
 Get on with what youve got 
 Aw everybody knows that its alright 
 Youve got no secrets to tell 
 But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock 
 You do it oh so well 
 Shes got marble eyes sweet china doll her thighs 
 An animal in pain she starts to cry 
 Her pipes are open wide she blows more than my mind 
 Echo the sounds of soul time after time 
 Shes stone cold bushAll you slingers and fiends 
 Hide behind your rocks 
 Put down your gloves 
 Im not here to box 
 This is no showdown 
 So throw down your guns 
 You see it doesnt matter 
 Where you come from 
 You could be from Park Ave 
 Or from a park bench 
 You could be a politician 
 Or a bitchy princess 
 But if youre lookin for a fist 
 And youre lookin to unite 
 Put your knuckleheads together 
 Make a fist and fight 
 Not to your death 
 And not to your grave 
 Im talkin bout that freedom 
 Fight like a brave 
 Fight like a brave  dont be a slave 
 No one can tell you youve got to be afraid 
 If youre sickasick n tired 
 Of being sick and tired 
 If youre sick of all the bullshit 
 And youre sick of all the lies 
 Its better late than never 
 To setaset it straight 
 You know the lie is dead 
 So give yourself a break 
 Get it through your head 
 And get it off your chest 
 Get it out your arm 
 Because its time to start fresh 
 You want to stop dying 
 The life you could be livin 
 Im here to tell a story 
 But Im also here to listen 
 No Im not your preacher 
 And Im not your physician 
 Im just trying to reach you 
 Im a rebel with a mission 
 You say youre running and youre running 
 And youre running afraid 
 You say you ran across the planet 
 But you couldnt get away 
 The fire in your brain 
 Was driving you insane 
 You were looking for a day 
 In a life that never came 
 So dont tell me that 
 Ive got to take a number 
 Cause Ive been to that doctor 
 And believe me thats a bummer 
 Hes one of a kind 
 Convention of the mind 
 And dont forget to mention 
 That it doesnt cost a dime 
 Come as you like 
 And leave any time 
 And one more thing 
 You know it doesnt have to rhyme 
 No one can tell you youve got to be afraidPsychic spies from China try to steal your minds elation 
 Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations 
 And if you want these kind of dreams its Californication 
 Its the 
 Edge of the world and all of western civilization 
 The sun may rise in the East at least its settled in a finer location 
 Its understood that Hollywood sells Californication 
 Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging 
 Celebrity skin is this your chin or is that war youre waging 
 Firstborn unicorn 
 Hardcore soft porn 
 Dream of Californication 
 Marry me girl be my fairy to the world be my very own constellation 
 A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information 
 And buy me a star on the Boulevard its Californication 
 Space may be the final frontier but its made in a Hollywood basement 
 And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off 
 Station to Station 
  
 And Alderaans not far away its Californication 
 Ooh ooh 
 Born and raised by those who praise control of population 
 Everybodys been there and I dont mean on vacation 
 Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation 
 And earthquakes are to a girls guitar theyre just another good vibration 
 And tidal waves couldnt save the world from Californication 
 Sicker than the rest there is no test but this is what youre craving 
 Dream of CalifornicationBurning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch 
 Burn it up no need to reconcile 
 Come and see me Im your west end perfect stranger in America 
 Lady on that states so full of style 
 Stand up turn around beat it out 
 You gotta sound Joe 
 Swing low and now I know 
 Its hard to let a brother go Joe 
 The many boots that you have laced could tell a story comin night and day  
 No one said that you would need a crowd 
 The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make 
 And now I only see your face in clouds 
 Tell me so  
 Do you know 
 Does it show 
 When Im low 
 And then again when I feel your love from far away I think of yesterday 
 I see a family we know how to smile 
 There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along 
 There comes a time when we will walk that mile 
 Its hard to let a brother go JoeMy love comes 
 And when it does 
 Its a crazy kind of 
 Selective affection 
 My love flows like a wise guys tie 
 In the zaniest of directions 
 My love protection my love erection 
 You better get some of my infection 
 My love can be bigger than 
 The hoover dam 
 My love can hide behind 
 A grain of sand 
 My love for life is fueled by 
 The love for my man 
 I love his mother and 
 The silly mystic man 
 Some people think hes bad 
 They say he doesnt laugh 
 And ask my dad 
 My love is death to apartheid rule 
 My love is deepest depth the ocean blues 
 My love is the zulu groove 
 My love is keep it or move 
 My love is a laughin boozed 
 My love is the pussy juice 
 My love cant be refused 
 My love is gettin my food 
 My love my love 
 My love began from love 
 My love for an unknown grubby bum 
 My love for the baby suckin on his thumb 
 My love for the best set of buns 
 My love for the feel of the drums 
 My love for a butter knuckle hands 
 My love for the swedes in the band 
 My love for the legs that I spin 
 My love for the fat mingy 
 My love is my gross inner self 
 My love is my dick in my head 
 My love is my dick in my headFeeling good and I dont know why 
 Another day and another high 
 I walk around like I am on the ray 
 Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei 
 I met a girl and I liked her vibe 
 Another day and another ride 
 I met a girl who wants to save the world 
 Make it safe 
 For someone else to find their faith 
 Im away Im away Im away Im away 
 Im away Im away Im away 
 Hanalei 
 Im away 
 A simple song and it made me cry 
 I really dont want to pass me by 
 A simple song that spoke of Hemingway 
 The revolution in your blood 
 Creates the wave 
 I picked her up on the road to surf 
 Looked a lot like a Mother Earth 
 She said Hello my name is Charlotte Gray hey 
 Im awayIf you want me to stay 
 Ill be around today 
 To be available for you to see 
 Im about to go there 
 Then youll know 
 For me to stay here 
 Ive got to be me 
 Youll never be in doubt 
 Thats what its all about 
 You cant take me for granted and smile 
 Count the days Im gone 
 Forget reachin me by phone 
 Cause I promise 
 Ill be gone for a while 
 And when you see me again 
 I hope that you have been 
 The kind of person 
 That you really are now 
 You got to get it straight 
 How could I ever be late 
 When youre my woman 
 Taking up my time 
 Oh how could I ever allow 
 I guess I wonder how 
 I could get out a pocket for fun 
 When you know that 
 Youre never number two 
 Number ones gonna be number one 
 Ill be good 
 I wish I could 
 Get this message over to you now 
 When you see me again 
 Ill be so good 
 I wish I couldLooks to me like heaven sent 
 No lullaby kids no five percent 
 Any way you want to cut that cake 
 Shes dying from the likes of abandonment 
 Lost in the valley without my horses 
 She needs somebody to hold 
 It looks to me like heaven 
 Sent this for your roughest night 
 She looks to me she looks to me all right 
 Whos going to take you home 
 And hold you when things arent so bright 
 Its a long walk down those tracks 
 Its a dirty walk in 
 Its a dirty walk back 
 Gonna learn aw way too much 
 Shootin dope in the back 
 Of a Caddillac Jack 
 Slow down the road to my back 40 
 Down in the South seas 
 Give me your mouth please 
 Resuscitation is the way I find things 
 I give you major 
 You give me minor 
 Dont fade away 
 Like an ocean liner 
 No one can tell me what my remorse is 
 God made this lady that stands before me 
 She shows the world up with a smile 
 And then she throws the fight 
 She looks to me she looks to me all right 
 Down on the bathroom floor 
 Shes searching for another light 
 She looks to me she looks to me all rightSuicide a month before I met you 
 Deep regrets I never could forget you 
 Somehow you made your way to my decade 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl 
 In the sun I see you with your guard down 
 Number one youre moving to a hard town 
 Do not dismiss the promise that you made me 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my time 
 Overkill you took another red pill 
 On the sheet is everything that you spilled 
 We are the ones you want to know right now 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo black light 
 Come again to murder your report card 
 Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard 
 You are the one I want to be stuck with 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight 
 Favor some 
 Way too young 
 Slave to none 
 Say goodbye my love 
 I can see it in your soul 
 Thought that I could make you whole 
 Let your lover sail 
 Death was made to fail 
 Sticky fingers find the way to take her 
 Crumple up another piece of paper 
 I know your days are numbered when it comes to 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life 
 Slip away into the solar system 
 Straighter rays you find a way to twist em 
 Some like it dark and now I know where to 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you 
 Serpentine I think she was an Aussie 
 Bloody hell a common kamikaze 
 Give up the ghost before you go under 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo wonder 
 Kicking hard and looking for a rescue 
 Watch me starve was never to impress you 
 I would have killed the part of me to have you 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo story 
 Babe I know love is a funny thing 
 Born to die in the eternal spring 
 Your flickering is more than just a small flame 
 Welcome to the party its a ball game 
 Pick up the stick its time to get hit with 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat 
 Suicide is never going to save you 
 When I cried it was because I came to 
 You are the one I want to know right now 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss thisFlashin lots of cash and spendin lotsoloot 
 Hes sitting at the bar  then hes sittin at the booth 
 Across the dance floor he does scoot 
 Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit 
 The caboose that could he goes toot toot 
 Been known to gag and sometimes puke 
 A very good friend of granny goose 
 Skinny sweaty man in the green suit 
 Hes half man and half cartoon 
 But good buddy dont be confused 
 Hes full blooded looney tune 
 Face to face with the man in the moon 
 His family doctor is doctor seuss 
 If you catch him in your soup please dont shoot 
 He was new in town 
 A free wheelin clown 
 A very funny young duke 
 Hangin under the roof 
 Of a place in time 
 United sound 
 Hell play a little guitar sing a few blues 
 Hes the kinda guy that you cant refuse 
 Despite the fact that hes no brute 
 Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move 
 Like an eight legged freak in snakeskin boots 
 Coming soon to a theatre near you 
 Skinny sweaty man in the green suitNever twentyone when everyones a sailor 
 Coming up strong at the animal bar 
 Everloving mug of Mister Norman Mailer 
 Turn another page at the animal bar 
 And it wont be long 
 No it wont be long 
 Because it cant be long 
 I I I the cry of isolation 
 I I I the high of meditation 
 I I I the sweet precipitation 
 I I I the high of depravation 
 Rain on my frustration 
 Stake my claim now break this 
 Wash me down my station 
 Makes more rain forsaken 
 In between the sky and every piece of the earth 
 One two three lets make this 
 Running through the mud Ive got a feeling of worth 
 One two three forsake this 
 All aboard the ship cause youre gonna need an ark 
 When the wet comes down youll be swimming like a shark 
 Mopping up the pain and Im a little older 
 Right as rain at the animal bar 
 I I I the mild precipitation 
 Raindrops will fall from the sky 
 Stealing their shape from your eye 
 Now we can all get some sleep 
 The water the water the water saving us from the heat 
 Some things will die in their place 
 Others will leave little trace 
 Fire will come by its day 
 The water the water the water washing it all away 
 One two three forsake thisNevermind the Pac Jam 
 Nevermind the Gap Band 
 Nevermind the Zap Band 
 Nevermind the Funk Scam 
 Cause were 
 The Red Hot Chili Peppers 
 Nevermind the English bands 
 Nevermind the Synth Funk bands 
 Nevermind the Wham Wham band 
 Nevermind Duran Duran 
 Nevermind the Soft Cell shit 
 Thats strictly for the twits 
 Nevermind the Men At Work 
 Those tunes are for the jerks 
 Nevermind Hall and Oates 
 Those guys are a couple of goats 
 Nevermind the Culture Club 
 That jives just one big flub 
 The Red Hot Chili PeppersWe got large and we got small 
 We got a swimming pool and a cannonball 
 We turn red and we turn green 
 Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen 
 Lost my mind cause Im on the plastic 
 Who knew its so damn drastic 
 Show me what it is you believe in 
 Slowly she sinks all her teeth in 
 Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans 
 Do you want to get up early in the morning 
 Take me to the river where we do the little storming 
 Hallelujah I feel it warming 
 Sitting here I count the moons 
 The orders we obeyed 
 Every night fore we go to bed 
 I watch while the others pray 
 Send it off through Delaware 
 Just make it fair for the legionnaires 
 Paint a simple portrait of my kind 
 Permission to the heartless bombs 
 GoldPlated Hate and the waitress moms 
 Serving up the stories of my mind 
 Mexico you are my neighbor 
 Home of the lets be braver 
 Give me all your sick and your tired 
 Races that we admire 
 Do you want to go dancing in Chicago 
 Trinidads got it bad for Tobago 
 Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado 
 Hallelujah a desperado 
 Coming down from the deserts where you 
 Caught a glimpse of the billionaire 
 Tell me Im the right one for the ride 
 Paper signs out on the lawns 
 Gold minds and the priceless pawns 
 Does your canyon really open wide 
 We got large and we got small 
 Its the craziest thing Ive ever seenIm a little pea 
 I love the sky and the trees 
 Im a teeny tiny little ant 
 Checking out this and that 
 I am nothing ah ah 
 So you have nothing to hide 
 And Im a pacifist 
 So I can fuck your shit up 
 Oh yeah Im small 
 Fuck you asshole 
 You homophobic redneck dick 
 Big and tough and macho 
 You can kick my ass 
 So fucking what 
 So fucking whatI got more love than anything else 
 But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health 
 Struck by the notion that there just might be 
 A method to the madness that I cannot see 
 Something for the freedom of a roughedup soul 
 Fortytwo years young is a little bit old 
 Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune 
 Got buffalo love living on the moon 
 Save this lady for me x4 
 Call me Alabama Im a Seminole prize 
 Got Times Square hair and a bedroom eyes 
 Keystone Kops and the billy bob chops 
 Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops 
 Vampire blood and a baseball glove 
 Are just a little bit of what the girl is made of 
 National crash into the big lampoon 
 With a creature coming up from the black lagoon 
 Losing ground true sounds of liberty 
 The forest of the north might hold the key 
 Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band 
 Black flag wave on on my truck my man 
 Basketball Jones and the great unknowns 
 Got cheap cologne seventysix trombones 
 Looking for the lady that wont be afraid 
 When heady needs a hammer gonna get things made 
 I got more love than anything else 
 But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my healthI saw your face 
 Elegant and tired 
 Cut up from the chase 
 Still I so admired 
 Bloodshot your smile 
 Delicate and wild 
 Give me shewolf style 
 Rip right through me 
 Silveretta the jets of a lifetime 
 Go and get her Ive got her on my mind 
 Nothing better the feeling is so fine 
 Simply put I saw your love stream flow 
 Come on baby cause theres no name for 
 Give it up and I got what I came for 
 Universally speaking 
 I take it back and you make me nervous 
 Nothing better than love and service 
 I win in the long run 
 I saw your crime 
 Dying to get high 
 Two of a kind 
 Beats all hands tonight 
 Silvretta the jets of a lifetime 
 Nothing better the feeling is so fine 
 Lets goLove is all the world 
 You say the world is gone 
 Love is all the world 
 You say its gone 
 I dont 
 The party in your eyes 
 Says someone to caress 
 A party in the sky 
 I think Ill wear a dress 
 God saves us all and tell us how it ends 
 Laugh till we fall so why cant we be friends 
 Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times 
 Work and play all day until the sun is high 
 Haley and the comets 
 Saving an old rock jam 
 The ukulele play another song Ill brag 
 Stole a lot from Peter 
 Cause had to pay your Paul 
 And when you find thats not enough 
 Hell break your fall 
 Some get on and some 
 Get off the carousel 
 I think its time to go 
 So I will fare thee well 
 Hell break your fallThrow away your television 
 Time to make this clean decision 
 Master waits for its collision now 
 Its a repeat of a story told 
 Its a repeat and its getting old 
 Throw away your television 
 Make a break big intermission 
 Recreate your super vision now 
 Renegades with fancy gauges 
 Slay the plague for its contagious 
 Pull the plug and take the stages 
 Throw away your television now 
 Oi oi oi 
 Take the noose off your ambition 
 Reinvent your intuition now 
 Salivate to repetition 
 Leviate this ill condition now 
 Its a repeat 
 Its a repeatNever too soon to be through 
 Being cool too much too soon 
 Too much for me too much for you 
 Youre gonna lose in time 
 Dont be afraid to show your friends 
 That you hurt inside inside 
 Pains part of life dont hide behind your false pride 
 Its a lie your lie 
 If you see me getting mighty 
 If you see me getting high 
 Knock me down 
 Im not bigger than life 
 Im tired of being untouchable 
 Im not above the love 
 Im part of you and youre part of me 
 Why did you go away 
 Finding what youre looking for 
 Can end up being being such a bore 
 I pray for you most every day 
 My loves with you now fly away 
 Its so lonely when you dont even know yourself 
 Its so lonely 
 Its so lonelyShes the one shes the only one 
 Shes got ripped back light 
 Gonna make me come 
 I say when I smile Im a really smile 
 I got dreams so wide like a country mile 
 I said now Ill take it 
 Its better for you 
 Somehow well make it 
 Cause thats what we do 
 Pick a star in the open sky 
 I see you see me and that is why I 
 Hop along to the cowboy beat 
 When I feel your fire jump up to me 
 Something out there 
 Where love is your only friend and 
 We are the ones 
 That will make you feel better 
 Someone to spare 
 When love is the only end and 
 In a world that has run amok 
 Ive got to set my sights just to get struck 
 I walk away from the rank and file 
 With a punched out mouth and a pack of style 
 I say shes the one shes the only one 
 Make me search myself until Im done and 
 Tell me now in a telegram 
 Do the sea of stars make a diagram and 
 And someone to spare 
 Oh yeah hell yeah yeah 
 So alive I arrive on dust 
 You can search my mind for the red on rust I said 
 Take me there and she really cares 
 Lighting up for me gonna hear my prayers 
 That will make you feel better nowShes a witch 
 A bat 
 A bonafide bore 
 Whats more  she snores 
 And that is a fact 
 Cow eyes lie 
 Yes its time to resist 
 How did I ever 
 Get into this 
 How could I ever 
 Have kissed that bitch 
 So what if shes 
 Got big tits 
 Shes the kinda girl 
 Who changes her mind really quick 
 Shes the kinda girl who 
 Wont just let things sit 
 She came like a cat 
 Like a cat to cat nip 
 She came in my lap 
 With her womanly hips 
 When I first met her 
 I came unglued 
 I played the part of 
 A blueblooded fool 
 Im through with your sewage 
 Im through with your trash 
 I always knew that Id 
 Get the last laugh 
 Like two trains on one track 
 Bound for a crash 
 Two red white and blues we were 
 Destined to clash 
 I cant fix the future 
 I cant change the past 
 Like fly by night news 
 We were not meant to last 
 Im through with your bluefish 
 Im through with your gash 
 Im through being screwed with by 
 You and your wack attack 
 Jump back for chump love 
 You wont be back for cover 
 But no no no no 
 Im no chump love sucker 
 No chump love sucker 
 I thought that your love 
 Was a matter of fact 
 But I lost my pride 
 When I realized that 
 The smack in my bag 
 And my baseball bat 
 Was all you were after 
 You dirty rat 
 Shes a bitch and a brat 
 And a living disaster 
 She thought she was fast 
 But I was faster 
 No chump love suckerKick back a little just to watch and see 
 Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery 
 Whatever your pleasure Im your punk 
 On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk 
 How I listened lo when you told me 
 That I was all you had to hold 
 How I wish it was so when you told me 
 That you were solid gold 
 Gravity free is she look at her 
 Highness on a mattress full of antimatter 
 You never left a very mellow impression 
 Your smell or your gotohell expression 
 Quixoticelixer might 
 But it probably will not fix your bite 
 Tell me now tell me how did I get 
 Your lipstick on my kite 
 I love this weather its a perfect storm 
 Just keep it coming in its perfect form 
 I love this weather cause it keep me warm 
 Everyday depression in a beautiful dress 
 Oh lady made a beautiful mess I guess 
 Dedicated mind in a medicated state 
 Is a highly overrated fate 
 Terrible is it so what you told me 
 That there is such a thing 
 Do you know that you glow when you go 
 From winter into spring 
 The madder the boy the sadder the song 
 Thats a wicked fate but the sick get strong 
 Mad boy sad song 
 Wicked fate but the sick get strong 
 Nobodys right and everyones wrong 
 I refuse to punt on fourth and long 
 Wicked fate but the sick get 
 Kick back a little just to watch and see 
 How I listened low when you told me 
 I wish it was so when you told me 
 I swear to God I could not hurt you 
 Ive got to be inside your virtue 
 I cant contain my urge to search you 
 I stand before this night no curfew 
 I long to be inside your virtue 
 My heart is swollen when I search you 
 Woo woo woo woo woo woo oh 
 Woo woo woo woo woo woo ohHere she comes in a suit and tie 
 Shepherds bush and a leopards pie 
 Shes marching to the funky beat 
 Of James Brown and his dancing feet 
 Gonna set your fish on fire 
 Pistolwhipping of desire 
 So please do not resist your fate 
 Ill pick you up yes its a date 
 How could I forget to mention 
 The bicycle is a good invention 
 Sitting there in a silent movie 
 Beside the only girl who really ever knew me 
 Happy days but sadder face 
 And heaven knows Im on the case 
 How could I forget to mention the bicycle 
 Somebody told the world 
 The beauty of your verse 
 My girl I heard it first 
 A sticky finger and a wicked taste 
 Got a lot of love and a lyrical case 
 Be sure to write it in your book 
 I promise not to look 
 I wanna smell your sunny face 
 Funny place but its never awaste 
 Id hop this fence to make amends 
 I hope this movie never ends 
 Make it up and making you my business 
 A funny buttercup gotta live for forgiveness 
 The beauty of your verseLittle Miss Lover where have you been in this world for so long 
 Well I love a lover who feels like you would you like to tag along 
 Well I really dont need any help little girl 
 But I think you can help me out anyway 
 Ah sock it to me 
 Would you believe baby Ive been lookin 
 For a Sue that feels like you for some time 
 Excuse me while I see if the Gypsy in me 
 Is right if you dont mind 
 Well he signals me okay so I think its safe to say that Im gonna make a play 
 Ah yeah 
 Hey Little Miss Lover 
 Well theres so much you and me can discover 
 Hey Little Miss LoverDriving around Ive got my baby and my top down 
 Marygoround I ride you for my love 
 Throwing me down in the backseat underground 
 Im on the mound I make it for my love 
 Making my way I brake another LA day 
 Time in the town I need it for my love 
 My Chevrolet youre rolling to another play day 
 This is the sound I listen for my love 
 Who you talking to 
 Talk to me you 
 Sound of music 
 I love you 
 Swim through me 
 Good feelings 
 Come to me 
 Sought and I found a life of making my blood sound 
 Do anything for the one I love 
 Something profound the face of God is in Sensurround 
 Come to meAll the creatures 
 On the beaches 
 Making waves in the motion picture 
 Wont you keep this 
 In between us 
 Search and seizure wake up Venus 
 The dollar bill will 
 Mentally ill Bill 
 Mom and Dad take your dont be sad pill 
 Turn the screw and 
 Twist my language 
 Dont forsake me Im contagious 
 Theres a reason for the 21 century 
 Not too sure but I know that its meant to be 
 And that its meant to be 
 Its my favorite 
 Combination 
 Coming down with the favorite nations 
 Deep flirtation 
 Mutilation 
 Learn to give and take dictation 
 Oh 
 Ohoh 
 Like the Cain and Abel 
 Time to run this table 
 Not too sure but I know thats its meant to be 
 Read me your scripture and 
 Read me your scripture 
 Read me your scripture and I will twist it 
 Show me your wrist and I 
 Show me your wrist and 
 Show me your wrist and Ill kiss it kiss it 
 Its time to run this table 
 Simple soldier

 Stop and read what you just wrote her 
 Strangulation 
 Altercation 
 Oral sex and bird migration 
 Cmon

 Police helicopter shot the sky 
 Police helicopter landin on my eye 
 Yeah 
 Police helicopter takes a nosedive 
 Police helicopter he aint shy 
 Unh

 Til death do us part 
 Break my heart so I can start 
 Supercalifragilistic 
 Kiss me in the futuristic 
 Twisted but I must insist 
 Its time to get on top of this 
 Its right on time its right on time 
 Its right on time its right on time its right on time its right on time 
 Looking fine youre looking fine and get on 1999 
 Discard to bombard 
 Calling all you shooting stars 
 Holy cow bowwowwow 
 Now Im here Im nowhere now 
 Joan of Arc reincarnated 
 Maybe we could be related 
 So much blood to circulate 
 And so much space to decorate 
 Plain and simple pain 
 I want to but I cant complain 
 Death row let us go 
 Its time to blow up for the show 
 All the world reverberated 
 Coming through we motorcaded 
 Vibrate when we operated 
 Turning up in solidstated 
 Oh LordI was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call 
 He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall 
 Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine 
 Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline 
 Everything they said about everything 
 Was acoming undone its a life supreme 
 I do and I dont well I do and I dont oh yeah 
 Feasting on the flowers so fast and young 
 Its a light so bright that I bite my tongue 
 The next dimension show me in 
 We were moving in the world expanding your realities 
 A force of nature on the verge commanding abnormalities 
 Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears 
 Twentysix a number much too small for someones golden years 
 You get a little bit more this time when you give a little bit for your mothers kind 
 Like she always said “Oh Dont look back just look ahead” 
 You sing a little bit stronger when you remember the song of your old best friend 
 Like she always said “Oh dont look back just look ahead” 
 I do and I dont well I do and I dont oh yeahPlease start dirty 
 Its 730 
 Loss of mind and 
 Cat alertly 
 My best your rest 
 Send your call 
 And then I nest 
 Perversity in features 
 Adversity that teaches 
 Some call love more 
 Soon Ill call the rhythm song 
 Its over 
 Its over now 
 So long to doodoora 
 I dare not get a look 
 Be yourself 
 Some let her call 
 Never fall 
 See yourself 
 Sit alone and wait 
 To my own call 
 Go ballistic 
 Anarchistic 
 Smack my mouth and 
 Then you kissed it 
 So long my gun 
 Simple run and 
 Letter bum 
 Things are looking good on paper 
 Once when I was in your favor 
 This kiss from a mess 
 Send my girl riddle less 
 So long to riddle songs 
 I dare not read a song 
 Sad alone and wait 
 To my own brawl 
 Free yourself 
 Theres an only count 
 This stands for all of them 
 Just play at any tempo 
 Going mad and going mental 
 All balm said no 
 Just to let him put it wrong 
 Its time to get along 
 Its over nowFlat on my back in a lonely sprawl 
 I stare at the ceiling cause I can not fall 
 Asleep tonight 
 No not at all 
 Head lights flash across my bedroom wall 
 Crying eyes open cause I can not fall 
 In love with you 
 No not at all 
 Walk away and taste the pain 
 Come again some other day 
 Arent you glad you werent afraid 
 Funny how the price gets paid 
 Busted in two like a brittle stick 
 I can not drink because my throat constricts 
 Lovesick from you 
 That will never do 
 Open my mouth I couldnt make a sound 
 I could not scream you know I could not shout 
 It out to you 
 Nothing to do 
 This may come as a shocking surprise 
 I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye 
 Goodbye my love 
 I am not alive 
 How the price gets paidLA Lakers fast break makers 
 Kings of the court shake and bake all takers 
 Back to back is a bad ass fact 
 A claim that remains intact 
 MAGIC 
 See you on the court 
 Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart 
 Magic of the Buck 
 Other teams pray for dreams 
 But he dont give a fuck 
 Penetrating the lane like a bullet train 
 Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain 
 Knucklehead suckers better duck 
 When the Buck comes through like a truck 
 Scott stops pops and drops it in 
 On his way back gets a little skin 
 From the hand of a man named AC Green 
 Slam so hard break your TV screen 
 Worthys hot with his tomahawk 
 Take it to the hole make your mamma talk 
 I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble 
 Is coming to your town and hes going to make rubble 
 LA Lakers fast break makers 
 I see you in purple and gold 
 You can swim but you wont get far so you might as well go home 
 In Buck we trust 
 Restoring order to the court and justice is a must 
 Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly 
 Cause theyve got more moves 
 Than a bowl of jelly 
 The Buck stops here  pops  then cheers 
 A roar through the forum 
 That deafens my ears 
 The one and only know of his kind 
 Sits in a throne 
 Not for the records that he holds 
 But for being bald and bold 
 Kareem Abdul Jabbar 
 All time great super superstar 
 I hate to burst your bubble 
 But triple double trouble 
 Is coming to your town 
 And hes gonna make rubble 
 Does anybody want some Magic Johnson 
 A claim that remains intactOh good god in heaven almighty heavens to Murgatroyd weve got a cataclysmic situation developing somebody get down here now

 WhooptayWhooptaygittagalagoopta

 A tiny storm in your teacup girl 
 I know you can battle the masses dear 
 Oh god oh no oh no its getting worse worse by the minute uhuhuh were down here at division and 5th street somebody send for back up right now 
 Every other day you say

 Famous last words 
 Spoken from the laserium 
 Descendents had a record 
 Sayin somethin bout Milo 
 You can take the ATrain 
 But youre gonna have to lie low 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 I know we may never get out of here 
 A tiny storm in your teacup girlI was walking 
 Through a courtyard 
 Without shoes and 
 Without regard 
 Automatic catacombs 
 Take me where I wanna go 
 All around 
 All in phases 
 It astounds 
 And amazes 
 Built to last and known to roam 
 Touch me Im a chromosome 
 What time 
 Fascinated by the face of time 
 I got it to give and now were gonna make some time 
 Ultrafine and altruistic 
 Can I spy into the mystic 
 System down for infiltration 
 Open mind free of frustration 
 I was driving 
 To a safe place 
 And arriving 
 As I retraced 
 Yell into a telescope 
 Aim it at the star of hope 
 All over the yonder 
 The smell of blood and thunder 
 Im connected by the lightning rod 
 Giving the beauty to it 
 Heaven knows how well I know you 
 TimeGod is good and fate is great 
 When it feels so strong its hard to wait 
 You never know how it might unfold 
 Hearts to break and bodies to hold 
 Time will tell but it never gets old 
 Like I told you Im in for the long long 
 Had tove been one of those things that took place in outer space 
 A match made in heaven not a scratch on her face 
 Angels must have smoked some dust 
 Singing songs about In God We Trust 
 Some things slide but this is a must 
 Like I told you theres a time for finding out 
 Ah people try to tell me what not to do 
 You shouldnt make it with a younger girl and 
 Too many chances for the foot to drop 
 I tried to tell em that I found a pearl well 
 Like I told you be careful what youre asking for 
 Hey sister Brutus 
 Ive got a mess of a better half oww 
 Hey sister Judas 
 Even you never had my back 
 She was the cutest thing that I ever did see 
 A drink in her hand and I dont mean tea 
 She was with a dude but I just didnt care 
 I had to find out these moments are rare 
 And Stevie says All is fair 
 Like I told you there is something for everyone 
 Well I guess I never told you some things 
 That I really really wanted to say 
 Did I do everything I could do 
 Or did the mice just need to play 
 Like I told you theres more than meets the eye 
 I said hey sister Judas 
 Im not trying to point fingers at you 
 And Im not trying to lay any blame 
 But when it comes to the punishment girl 
 You know how to bring the pain 
 Like I told you Id do it all again 
 Come on 
 Theres a fury to the womans wrath oww 
 Even you never had my backMy boys they like to tell me when Im wrong hey now 
 My girl she like to sing now sing my song 
 Everybody tell me when Im wrong today 
 Anyway I say 
 My boys hey they like to tell me when Im bad cmon 
 Make me happy when Im sad cmon now 
 Take it Johnny 
 I said my girl she like to say thats what I had 
 When Im here now when Im wrong and when Im bad 
 Anyway Id like to say oh yeah 
 Cmon Chad 
 My boy he like to tell me what I had 
 Yeah now what dyou do with everything youve had 
 I dont know that aint bad 
 Woo no that aint badSome people say you hate me 
 I dont believe its true 
 Things that youre going through 
 Some people say you hate me 
 I dont believe its you 
 Some people say to pray for 
 The one you want to live 
 The eyes that once were his 
 The way you want to live 
 The eyes you want to give 
 Some people say you played me 
 I dont care if its true 
 Im waiting here for you 
 Some people say you made it 
 Im not afraid to know 
 When things are getting low 
 Things that youre going throughOh give me a home 
 Where the buffalo roam 
 And the death of a race is a game 
 Where seldom is heard 
 A peacable word 
 From the white trash 
 Who killed as they came 
 Though these words dig deep 
 They offer no relief 
 God save the queen 
 I am an Indian chief 
 There is a secret I keep 
 Its called the talking leaf 
 And you better believe 
 That he speaks his beliefs 
 Like a rock that bleeds 
 A sea of grief 
 My talking leaf speaks of 
 A wounded knee creek 
 American ghost dance 
 A new man who is with old ways 
 He walks the streets of life 
 But hes in chains 
 Im alive he cried 
 I can feel the flame 
 Burning red inside 
 I am an Indian brave 
 There is a memory 
 That lives in my blood 
 Of the brand you laid 
 On all you touched 
 But the burning flame 
 Turns to burning pain 
 Genuine genocide 
 And thats truly insane 
 So like a wild hurricane 
 I will dance on the grave 
 Of my race that died 
 When it should have been saved 
 American ghost danceTime to swing a little melody 
 To make you all feel something sexually 
 And now were gonna get it on in the groove 
 The groove that makes those smooth hips move 
 We are pumpin that drivin bad rhythm 
 To make those pretty little pussy lips schism 
 Kissum kissum kissum 
 In the mind is one design 
 To make you feel fine 
 Suckin on mine with a 69 
 Im inclined to fuck fuck fuck fuck your brains out 
 For the moment come on now make her shout 
 Pump that leman till it pouts 
 Open your legs to the sensual sound 
 With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound 
 I can tell youre like a horny bloodhound 
 Feel the bass hug the ground 
 Just drop your knees and come unbound 
 And now you make your mouth to get on down 
 Our lust for notes will boil your blood 
 When they slither and slide on under your hood 
 Makin me shoot my power packed pud 
 Like a wild lady lovin a viable stud 
 Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud 
 Gettin it gettin it gettin it good 
 In my head as a hellified hum 
 I take to rubbin her on the bum 
 Adjust the lips some on the tongue 
 With my thumb I strum her plum 
 Start to make her orgasm 
 Tastes a little bit like ooh how rum 
 Well I like to make her cum 
 To the rhythm of the drums 
 Make cum make cum cumShes only 18 dont like the Rolling Stones 
 She took a shortcut to being fully grown 
 She got that mood ring her little sister Rose 
 The smell of Springsteen a pair of pantyhose 
 This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette 
 She said my man you know its time to get your fingers wet 
 You hustle faster when you cant afford a cigarette 
 The last I heard from you you were screaming handle it 
 Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head 
 The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead 
 Fascinated by the look of you and what was said 
 Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed 
 I heard some PFunk out on the road again 
 To get your head shrunk is what I recommend 
 Its in your bloodline a perfect Frankenstein 
 Out on that lone pine Im gonna make you mine 
 Its understood you wrap your voodoo right around my neck 
 Youve got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque 
 I put my lovin in your oven not a head to check 
 The last I heard from you you were screaming resurrect 
 Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shedIn a world that can be so insane 
 I dont think its very strange 
 For me to be in love with you 
 I want to know more than your brain 
 Into my life you were injected 
 Not something that I expected 
 Now I smile from your affection 
 We have made a soul connection 
 Just for whom does your bell toll 
 Dont be cold show me your soul 
 Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid 
 To show you when I am you 
 Youre my best friend 
 Show me your soul 
 In a world that can 
 Yes I find you so appealing 
 When you show me how youre feeling 
 You my friend need not be kneeling 
 Open up and stop revealing 
 Trust in me my heart is whole 
 I need to see 
 Sentimental gentlemen 
 Dont expect too much from me 
 Perfection is no test for me 
 Because the best Ill ever be 
 I just like you a human being 
 You wont offend I need to know 
 Please my friend 
 Show me your soul 
 Sentimental GentlemenStart marching

 Counting days and 
 Skipping your stones into the sun

 Living the dream of a meteorite 
 Start jumping cause 
 Weve got something to say yeah

 Make time for love and your happiness 
 The Mothers Of Invention are the best

 A tender mess for everyone I guess

 Dirty laundry

 One foot in the astral plane

 Waiting to be strode 
 Ropes untying 
 This power I could not withhold 
 Satisfying 
 What do we contain 
 Cant stop crying 
 These tears of change 
 Remain the same 
 My girl she shoots down 
 The baddest of guys 
 She knows that they 
 Want me dead 
 She fires up the starry night 
 And fills them so full 
 So full of lead 
 Does it go two ways 
 This body I can not detain 
 Wake up flying 
 She the solar shores 
 Passers buying 
 The memories we readorn 
 Nothing to obtain 
 No crawling through 
 The halls of fame 
 Loss becomes the gain 
 Recreate me 
 So I may sustainAll my life I was swinging for the fence 
 I was looking for the triple 
 Never playing good defense 
 Gunnin for the glitter 
 Every hot and heavy hitter 
 She was never really there so I couldnt really get her 
 I said 
 Factually I Im just a piece of it 
 Factually I the very least of it 
 Piece of work I was really quite a jerk 
 Keeping score is such a bore a busy mind could go berserk 
 Feast on this I was fishing for a hook 
 So I took a little trip and I opened up the book 
 Factually I its just a medicine 
 Make you wanna cry why dont they let us in 
 Be my wife I think youre right that we should mate 
 Tell your friends I got a factory of faith 
 Late last night I had a dream that it was great

 Young blood is the lovin upriser 
 How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser 
 Give it away give it away give it away now

 Greedy little people in a sea of distress 
 Keep your more to receive your less 
 Unimpressed by material excess 
 Love is free love me say Hell yes

 Badge out laid off 
 Says hes got a bad cough 
 Wants to get it paid off 
 Look out kid 
 Its somethin you did 
 God knows when 
 But youre doin it again 
 You better duck down the alley way 
 Lookin for a new friend 
 The man in the coonskin cap 
 In the big pen 
 Wants eleven dollar bills 
 You only got ten 
 Maggie comes fleet foot 
 Face full of black soot 
 Talkin that the heat put 
 Plants in the bed but 
 The phones tapped anyway 
 Maggie says that many say 
 They must bust in early May 
 Orders from the D A 
 Dont matter what you did 
 Walk on your tip toes 
 Dont try No Doz 
 Better stay away from those 
 That carry around a fire hose 
 Keep a clean nose 
 Watch the plain clothes 
 You dont need a weather man 
 To know which way the wind blows 
 Oh get sick get well 
 Hang around a ink well 
 Ring bell hard to tell 
 If anything is gonna sell 
 Try hard get barred 
 Get back write braille 
 Get jailed jump bail 
 Join the army if you fail 
 Youre gonna get hit 
 But losers 
 Cheaters 
 Sixtime users 
 Hang around the theaters 
 Girl by the whirlpool 
 Lookin for a new fool 
 Dont follow leaders 
 Watch the parkin meters 
 Ah get born keep warm 
 Short pants romance learn to dance 
 Get dressed get blessed 
 Try to be a success 
 Please her please him buy gifts 
 Dont steal dont lift 
 Twenty years of schoolin 
 And they put you on the day shift 
 They keep it all hid 
 Better jump down a manhole 
 Light yourself a candle 
 Dont wear sandals 
 Try to avoid the scandals 
 Dont wanna be a bum 
 You better chew gum 
 The pump dont work 
 Cause the vandals took the handlesScar tissue that I wish you saw 
 Sarcastic mister knowitall 
 Close your eyes and Ill kiss you cause 
 With the birds Ill share 
 With the birds Ill share this lonely view 
 Push me up against the wall 
 Young Kentucky girl in a pushup bra 
 Falling all over myself 
 To lick your heart and taste your health cause 
 Blood loss in a bathroom stall 
 Southern girl with a scarlet drawl 
 Wave goodbye to ma and pa cause 
 Soft spoken with a broken jaw 
 Step outside but not to brawl in 
 Autumns sweet we call it fall 
 Ill make it to the moon if I have to crawl and 
 Scar tissue that I wish you saw 
 With the birds Ill share this lonely viewBear paws and rascal power 
 Watching us in your garage 
 Big girl you ate the neighbor 
 The nova is over 
 Wake up and play 
 By the radio 
 Make room for Claras bare feet 
 The lover a Martian 
 Tick tock theyre waiting for the meteor 
 This clock is opening another door 
 Lots of love just keep it comin 
 Making something out of nothin 
 These are the best that I 
 I dont know how to say 
 Look at what I love today 
 I dont know what to say 
 Look at what I lost today 
 These are the things that I 
 Blood flowers in the kitchen 
 Signing off and winding down 
 This Martian ends her mission 
 She caught the ball 
 By the mission bell 
 Chase lizards bark at donkeys 
 Lets bow our heads 
 And let the trumpets blow 
 Our girl is gone 
 God bless her little soul 
 Losin what I love today 
 Shes got sword in case 
 Though this is not her lord in case 
 The one who cant afford to face her image is restored to grace 
 Disappeared no trace 
 Musky tear suitcase 
 The downturn brave little burn cub 
 Bear careless turnip snare rampages 
 Pitch color pages 
 Down and out but not in Vegas 
 Disembarks and disengages 
 No loft 
 Sweet pink canary cages 
 Plummet pop dew skin fortitude for the sniffing black noses 
 That snort and allude to dangling trinkets 
 That mimic the dirt cough go drink its 
 Its for you 
 Blue battered naval down slip kisses 
 Delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters 
 Arrive in time to catch the late show 
 Its a beehive barrel race 
 A shehive stare and chase 
 Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her 
 Embossed beneath a box in the closet thats lost 
 The kind that you find when you mind your own business 
 Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters 
 Into the new morning milk blanket 
 Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny 
 Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay 
 Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterdays fallen freckles awayBroke down I found 
 Even when you think you need a rest 
 You will live to fight another round 
 I know its too bad so sad 
 All the things that we couldve been and couldve had 
 Hey girl what sound 
 A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground 
 Now I found you right here 
 A million miles of water 
 You were my muse 
 Just because you happen to have a bomb doesnt mean you light the fuse 
 I know that my girl big lie 
 Four years in and you never even said goodbye 
 A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground 
 A million miles of water dear 
 I want you to remember that some times we have to go without 
 Now I found it right here 
 I want you to remember dear 
 We were two of a funny kind 
 So damn blind but now we got to nevermind 
 I know that this is the end we tried 
 So hard but now I got to lose a friend 
 I want you to remember dearDusting off your savior 
 Well you were always my favorite 
 Always my man  All in a hand 
 To celebrate you is greater 
 Now that I can  Always my man 
 Now you see what I came for 
 No one here is to blame for 
 Misunderstand  All in a hand 
 Just like you cause you made me 
 All that I am  All in a hand 
 A butterfly that flaps its wings 
 Affecting almost everything 
 The more I hear the orchestra 
 The more I have something to bring 
 And now I see you in a beautiful 
 And different light 
 Hes just a man and any damage done 
 Will be all right 
 Call out my name 
 Call and I came 
 Dusting off your savior 
 Forgiving any behavior 
 Hes just a man  All in a hand 
 Your heros destined to waver 
 Anyone can  Always my man 
 I would never betray you 
 Look at me who could raise you 
 Face in the sand  Safe in your hand 
 You were always my favorite 
 We are the red hots 
 And were loving up the lovemenots 
 The flowers in your flower pots 
 Are dancing on your table tops 
 Hes just a man and everything he does 
 The life that you have narrated 
 You were my manRoad trippin with my two favorite allies 
 Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies 
 Its time to leave this town its time to steal away 
 Lets go get lost anywhere in the USA 
 Lets go get lost lets go get lost 
 Blue you sit so pretty west of the one 
 Sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun 
 Just a mirror for the sun 
 These smiling eyes are just a mirror for 
 So much has come before those battles lost and won 
 This life is shining more forever in the sun 
 Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf 
 Staying high and drys more trouble than its worth in the sun 
 In Big Sur we take some time to linger on 
 We three hunky dorys got our snakefinger on 
 Now let us drink the stars its time to steal away 
 Lets go get lost right here in the USA 
 Sparkles light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun 
 Your smiling eyes are just a mirror forA wannabe gangster thinking hes a wise guy 
 Rob another bank hes a sockemintheeye guy 
 Tank head Mr Bonnie and Clyde guy 
 Look him in the eye hes not my kinda guy 
 Never wanna be confusion proof 
 Puddings sweet but too aloof 
 Orangeeye girl with a backslide dew said 
 Yo homie who you talking to 
 A backed up paddywagon mackin on a cats ass 
 One uppercut to the cold upper middle class 
 Born to storm on boredoms face 
 And a little lust to the funkyass Flea bass 
 Most in the race just lose their grace 
 The blackest hole in all of space 
 Crooked as a hooker now suck my thumb 
 Anybody wanna come get some 
 If you have to ask youll never know 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go oh woh woh 
 Dont ask me why Im flying so high 
 Mr Bubble meets Superfly in my third eye 
 Searching for a soul bride shes my freakette 
 Soak it up inside deeper than a secret 
 Much more than meets the eye 
 To the funk I fall into my new ride 
 My hand my hand 
 Magic on the one is a medicine man 
 Thinking of a few taboos that I ought to kill 
 Dancing on their face like a stage in vaudeville 
 I feel so good cant be understood 
 Booty of a hoodlum rocking my red hood 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go oh woh wohDoes it go from east to west ya 
 Body free and a body less ya 
 Come again just to start afresh and 
 Once again to find a home 
 In the moment of the meantime 
 Dropping in coming through the mesh ya 
 Checking in just to get it blessed ya 
 Hard to leave when its picturesque 
 Find a form thats free to roam 
 Ah Where you come from 
 Ah Where you going 
 Do it all then it all again ya 
 Make it up and you make a friend ya 
 Paddle on just around the bend and 
 Find a place where you can see 
 All the mamas and the papas 
 Take a chance on a recommend ya 
 Hard as hell just to comprehend ya 
 Disbelief that I do suspend and 
 Easy now to find a breeze 
 We all want to tell her 
 Tell her that we love her 
 Venice gets a queen 
 Best Ive ever seen 
 We all want to kiss her 
 Tell her that we miss her 
 Best Ive ever

 In God do you still disagree

 Drifting and floating and fading away 
 Porcelain 
 Do you smell like a girl when you smile 
 Can you bear not to share with your child 
 Little lune 
 All day 
 Do you carry the moon in your womb 
 Someone said that youre fading too soon 
 Nodding and melting and fading away 
 Little lune x2Deep inside these sleeping shallows 
 Far away where no one goes now 
 Take my place in Gordon Spacer 
 TV star that no one knows now 
 Deep deep mystery is talking to me 
 Shes a giver of constant animation 
 All around and ready to make a new formation 
 Youre the reason Im in this world 
 I dont believe in everything I see 
 Rivers of Avalon 
 Your supernatural energy 
 Part of my scenery 
 What I belong to is your ecstacy 
 Your faith gone wavering is key 
 The clone of my own lonliness 
 Has got to be what am I known to 
 Little darlin in your starlin 
 Loving ways that Ive succumbed to 
 Shes a giver of constant adulation 
 Wadda you see in me 
 Your the reason Im in this world 
 All out in meAll of my love 
 And most of my fears 
 Been comin on strong 
 For most of my 
 Years add up 
 And end up in a song 
 Cellophane tweeds 
 And revenue streams 
 Blockin my shots 
 And killin my 
 Dreams that showed me 
 How to be the cause 
 Ooh ah yella ooh ah hey ah what now 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man 
 Its a longtime for me I see 
 Shes wants to belong and 
 I want to be free 
 Excommunicated 
 Cause there aint no guarantee 
 Ooh ah yella ooh ah 
 All of my friends 
 And enemies near 
 Were part of this dance 
 That put me right 
 So glad I got this chance 
 Better know plans 
 And lesser known schemes 
 Were all about love 
 And less about 
 Me Id have to say 
 She wore the pants 
 Thats oh 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man thats right 
 Its a longtime for me uhuh 
 Woo Yeah 
 Ah 
 Go 
 Ive been left 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man thats me 
 Its a long time for me uhuh 
 She wants to be rich 
 And I want to be free 
 Keep your plans elastic 
 Cause there aint no guaranteeDeck 
 You start by doing that first okay 
 Okay here we go 
 Deck deck 
 Not you not you 
 Deck deck deck 
 Deck no deck 
 Deck the halls with boughs of holly 
 Falalalalalalalala 
 Tis the season to be jolly 
 Don we now our gay apparel 
 Something something Yuletide carol 
 Merry ChristmasThis is the place where all the junkies go 
 When time gets fast but everything gets slow 
 Can I get some vaseline 
 Step into a modern scene 
 Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream 
 I dont wanna do it like my daddy did 
 I dont wanna give it to my babys kid 
 This is my calling 
 I said my darling 
 Shocking appalling 
 All I can do to you 
 Hammers are falling 
 This is the place where all the devils plead 
 Their case to take from you what they need 
 Can I isolate your gene 
 Can I kiss your dopamine 
 In a way I wonder if shes living in a magazine 
 I dont wanna say it if it isnt so 
 I dont wanna weigh it but Ive gotta know 
 I saw you out there yesterday 
 What did you want to say 
 A perfect piece of DNA 
 Caught in a flashing ray 
 I caught you out there in the fray 
 A masterpiece of DNA 
 Can I smell your gasoline 
 Can I pet your wolverine 
 On the day my best friend died I could not get my carpet clean 
 I dont wanna take it up with little Joe 
 I dont wanna fake it but Ive gotta know 
 I am a misfit 
 Im born with all of it 
 The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split 
 Im in a flash ray 
 A mash of DNA 
 Another poppin Jay who thinks hes got something to saySomeone 
 There are no worries for someone 
 Lifes in no hurry for someone 
 There are no worries for 
 Nothing major or too complicated 
 Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated 
 For someone 
 Someone 
 Cut my heart out 
 With a feather 
 And put an end 
 To any extra pressure 
 Ride around on mellow waves of mercy 
 And fill the space with lack of controversy 
 Set it up to follow you 
 On my aeroplane 
 Heres a present 
 For the future memory lane 
 Light it up the room 
 She sang into any twane 
 Hit em up cause you got me 
 A moth to your flame 
 There are no worries for me 
 For me 
 For meShade stay know all 
 But they communicate 
 Try fade 
 The leverage of space 
 Star jay 
 The fall dawn aim to place 
 With shades on 
 The leverage of 
 Shade shade shade 
 The leverage of the leverage of 
 Space shade shade 
 Hate breaks down 
 Mountains that we 
 Make so tame 
 Oh the leverage of 
 When I was down upon myself 
 I walked a road thats always there 
 You and I were everywhere 
 And Im alone 
 She would never know the reason 
 That I loved to come and see her 
 Where she sits Ill never go 
 You know its always there 
 The leverage of the leverage ofE I O I E I A 
 When you give your love away 
 You get a feeling for 
 E I O I E I A 
 Live to love another day 
 Even when you feel unsure 
 More and more I wanna raise 
 Raise my bar and raise your stakes 
 When I lay there wide awake 
 For my son Ill make 
 Tell my boy I love him so 
 Tell him so he knows 
 Lost in Ethiopia 
 Walk out in that road 
 Something good gonna come your way 
 Just look out your door 
 Tell em what you wanna say 
 No matter what you might incur 
 Steal my heart to give away 
 Make me wanna say 
 You and I are sewn the same 
 More and more and more each day 
 Walk out in that roadThere must be something in the way I feel 
 That she dont want me to feel 
 The stare she bears cut me 
 I dont care you see so what if I bleed 
 I could never change just what I feel 
 My face will never show what is not real 
 A mountain never seems to have the need to speak 
 A look that shares so many seek 
 The sweetest feeling I got from you 
 The things I said to you were true 
 I could have lied Im such a fool 
 My eyes could never never never keep their cool 
 Showed her and I told her how 
 She struck me but Im fucked up now 
 But now shes gone yes shes gone away 
 A soulful song that would not stay 
 You see she hides cause she is scared 
 But I dont care I wont be spared 
 I showed her and I told her how 
 Fucked up nowHow long how long will I slide 
 Separate my side I dont 
 I dont believe its bad 
 Slitting my throat its all I ever 
 I heard your voice through a photograph 
 I thought it up and brought up the past 
 Once you know you can never go back 
 I gotta take it on the other side 
 Centuries are what it meant to me 
 A cemetery where I married the sea 
 Stranger things could never change my mind 
 Take it on the other side 
 Take it on take it on 
 How long how long will I slide 
 Pour my life into a paper cup 
 The ashtrays full and Im spilling my guts 
 She wants to know Am I still a slut 
 A scarlet starlet and shes in my bed 
 A candidate for a soulmate bled 
 Push the trigger and pull the thread 
 Turn me on take me for a hard ride 
 Burn me out leave me on the other side 
 I yell and tell it that its not my friend 
 I tear it down I tear it down and then its born again 
 How long how long 
 I dont I dont believe its bad 
 Slitting my throat its all I everSometimes I feel like I dont have a partner 
 Sometimes I feel like my only friend 
 Is the city I live in the city of angels 
 Lonely as I am together we cry 
 I drive on her streets cause shes my companion 
 I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am 
 She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy 
 Well I never worry now that is a lie 
 And I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Take me to the place I love take me all the way 
 I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Yeah yeahyeah 
 Its hard to believe that theres nobody out there 
 Its hard to believe that Im all alone 
 At least I have her love the city she loves me 
 Well I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Oh no no no yeahyeah 
 Love me I said yeah yeah

 Count on you not to deplete me 
 Count on you not to defeat me

 Oh its what I know 
 A vintage year for pop I hear 
 The middle of the end is near 
 Lets go oh its what I know 
 Torture me and torture me 
 Forcin me so torture me please 
 Torture me with sorcery 
 All the leaves are turning brown 
 The wind is pushing me around 
 Lets go its what I know 
 Its forcin me so torture me please 
 The will of God is standing still 
 Brazilian children get their fill 
 Lets go 
 Lets turn it up and dumb it down

 And all the leaves are turning brown 
 A vintage year for pop I hear 
 Its so 
 Its forcin me and so torture me please 
 Forcin me so torture me pleaseI am a man cut from the know 
 Rarely do friends come and then go 
 She was a girl soft but estranged 
 We were the two our lives rearranged 
 Feeling so good that day 
 A feeling of love that day 
 Twisting and turning your feelings are burning 
 Youre breaking the girl 
 She meant you no harm 
 Think youre so clever but now you must sever 
 He loves no one else 
 Raised by my dad girl of the day 
 He was my man that was the way 
 She was the girl left alone 
 Feeling the need to make me her home 
 I dont know what when or why 
 The twilight of love had arrived 
 He loves no one elseWhy do you do what you do 
 I do what I want to do 
 Who said you could do what you do 
 I told you who told me to 
 Funky crime funky crime 
 Dont you know funks colours blind 
 Well Ive committed a funky crime 
 Against a state of mind 
 Hey you mister interview 
 I dont have to answer you 
 This is what I grew into 
 Dont judge me and my soul stew 
 Funk is my attitude 
 Barriers of race 
 In the media take place 
 Tellin you there is no room 
 For what you do dont budge 
 Theres no groove to your cold gloom 
 And who made you the judge 
 Always room for funky tunes 
 And yes I funk it up 
 I funk it up 
 Funky boy 
 Meets a funky girl 
 Make it funky baby 
 Cause the funk is crazy 
 Why do you do what you do 
 Funky crime 
 A funky funky crime 
 The crime is funkyBang on my window if 
 You want to get your look out 
 I felt the wind blow when 
 She took her little book out 
 Im steady loving on the 
 Lady of these pages 
 Another chapter if you will 
 So advantageous 
 Down on the river tonight 
 Take off your glasses and fight 
 Under the hula moon Im 
 Going to pop the culture 
 Blue cherry dress on you 
 Is looking like a sculpture 
 This recreation is amusing 
 And confusing 
 You never knew that it 
 Could feel so good while losing 
 What you lose 
 Your virginity 
 Ill be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 Get so emotional 
 I got a notion for 
 And when a star gets bent 
 Ill be your parliament 
 My intuition was a 
 Poppin and a shakin 
 The very thought of it was 
 All too much to take in 
 Curl up with lover we 
 Could lie out on the blanket 
 This canopy above Ill 
 Take the time to thank it 
 Take off your panties and fight 
 I want to bury my face 
 Deep in your aroma 
 Her name is Lisa 
 But they call her Desdemona 
 Come out and see me for 
 Some street communication 
 I think its sweet of you 
 To be my motivation 
 Sit back and watch it flowCant stop addicted to the shindig 
 Chop top he says Im gonna win big 
 Choose not a life of imitation 
 Distant cousin to the reservation 
 Defunkt the pistol that you pay for 
 This punk the feeling that you stay for 
 In time I want to be your best friend 
 Eastside love is living on the West End 
 Knocked out but boy you better come to 
 Dont die you know the truth is some do 
 Go write your message on the pavement 
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
 White heat is screaming in the jungle 
 Complete the motion if you stumble 
 Go ask the dust for any answers 
 Come back strong with fifty belly dancers 
 The world I love the tears Ive dropped 
 To be part of the wave cant stop 
 Ever wonder if its all for you 
 The world I love the trains I hop 
 Come and tell me when its time to 
 Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone 
 So smart shes leading me to ozone 
 Music the great communicator 
 Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
 Ill get you into penetration 
 The gender of a generation 
 The birth of every other nation 
 Worth your weight the gold of meditation 
 This chapters going to be a close one 
 Smoke rings I know youre going to blow one 
 All on a spaceship persevering 
 Use my hands for everything but steering 
 Cant stop the spirits when they need you 
 Moptops are happy when they feed you 
 J Butterfly is in the treetop 
 Birds that blow the meaning into bebop 
 To be part of the wave cant stop 
 Wait a minute Im passing out win or lose 
 Just like you 
 Far more shocking than anything I ever knew 
 How about you 
 Ten more reasons why I need somebody new 
 Right on cue 
 Cant stop addicted to the shindig 
 Choose not a life of imitation 
 Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
 In time I want to be your best friend 
 Kick start the golden generator 
 Sweet talk but dont intimidate her 
 Cant stop the gods from engineering 
 Feel no need for any interfering 
 Your image in the dictionary 
 This life is more than ordinary 
 Can I get two maybe even three of these 
 Coming from space to teach you of the Pleiades 
 This life is more than just a read throughSat on a cliff 
 Wondering what did I miss 
 I watch the waves come in 
 Roll in roll out 
 Without a single doubt 
 Love on a bluff 
 Is there ever enough 
 I stare into the air 
 Somewhere out there 
 The family affair 
 Bring home the night 
 Hey I know that you turned on the light 
 Hey so slow but you gave me 
 The love of my life 
 Coming up short 
 And Im sad to report 
 We fuss and fight tonight 
 Your case my case 
 Another day to waste 
 Lovers dont mix 
 When they cant even fix 
 A plot that has a twist 
 To share my prayer 
 I need my baby bear 
 Come home tonight 
 Hey hey hey I know 
 That I waited so long 
 Hey hey hey so slow 
 But you gave me the love of my life 
 Oh she gave me the love of my life 
 Tell her Flea go aheadI like pleasure spiked with pain 
 And music is my aeroplane 
 Its my aeroplane 
 Songbird sweet and sour Jane 
 Pleasure spiked with pain 
 That motherfuckers always spiked with pain 
 Looking in my own eyes hey Lord 
 I cant find the love I want 
 Someone better slap me 
 Before I start to rust 
 Before I start to decompose 
 Looking in my rear view mirror 
 I can make it disappear 
 I can make it disappear Have no fear 
 I like pleasure spiked with pain 
 Sitting in my kitchen hey girl 
 Im turning into dust again 
 My melancholy baby 
 The star of Mazzy must 
 Push her voice inside of me 
 Im overcoming gravity 
 Its easy when youre sad to be 
 Its easy when youre sad sad like me 
 Just one note 
 Could make me float 
 Could make me float away 
 One note from 
 The song she wrote 
 Could fuck me where I lay 
 Could make me choke 
 One note thats not a lie 
 Could cut my throat 
 One note could make me die 
 Thats spiked with pain 
 Its my aeroplaneCatholic school girls rule 
 In the class shes taking notes 
 Just how deep deep is my throat 
 Mother Mary dont you know 
 Shes got eyes like Marilyn Monroe 
 Catholic school girls rule 
 From the cross shes raised her head 
 This is what the sister said 
 Give no love until youre wed 
 Live no life until youre dead 
 The good book says we must suppress 
 The good book says we must confess 
 But who cares what the good book says 
 Cause now shes taking off her dress 
 Lead us into temptation 
 We are pure divine creation 
 Talkin about my generation 
 Injected with the seed of immaculation 
 CatholicI I I I I 
 I I I II I 
 Cry 
 I cry 
 I was born in a land 
 I dont think you understand 
 Goddamn 
 What I am 
 Im a native of this place 
 Please dont kick me in my face 
 My race 
 Has been disgraced 
 Wont somebody testify 
 Kick a hole right in the sky 
 Testify testify 
 Slap a liar in his eye 
 Johnny 
 Johnny Johnny 
 I I I I I 
 Wonder why 
 Oh why 
 Put us in your pumpkin shell 
 Where you keep us very well 
 Its hell 
 Where I dwell 
 When history books are full of shit 
 I become the anarchist 
 Im pissed 
 At this 
 What this country claims to be 
 Its a lie no place 
 I bleed 
 Decide 
 To defy 
 Kill my trust if you must 
 But in my blood there is the lust 
 For life 
 Apache blood is in my heart 
 Thrashing though me like a shark 
 Crashing 
 Though the dark 
 Johnny 
 Confide 
 What am I supposed to do 
 I feel like Im cut in two 
 Confused 
 By rules 
 Do these two cultures clash 
 Or am I living in the past 
 I ask 
 Please tell me fast 
 I 
 To what do I belong 
 And if I change will I be wrong 
 Be wrong 
 Thats wrong 
 I took my foot and kicked 
 A hole in the sky 
 I proceeded to plead 
 Oh fathers help me decide 
 A jagged flash of light 
 Struck me in the eye 
 I turned around and found 
 That I was still alive 
 Snakes rise high 
 From the purple black sky 
 The red cloud rains 
 And the black horse rides 
 Then it dawned on me 
 Like the morning sun 
 Im a part of two worlds 
 And the morning comes 
 Glowing embers tend 
 To remember when 
 The power that is peace 
 Was treated as a friend 
 I am a master of adaption 
 And Ive got to take action 
 Im a man 
 The animal manIm coming for ya cause 
 Cause I adore ya and 
 I like to get inside your mass production 
 This indecision has 
 Has got me cringing well 
 I cant resist the smell of your seduction 
 Did I let you know 
 Would you like to go 
 Unwrap the package without much persuasion 
 I wanna dance to everydays occasion 
 This I know Yeah this I know 
 Take me home well take me home 
 This I know were not alone 
 Take me home take me home 
 When we envision a lack of division and 
 The planet does another revolution 
 The day I blew on ya 
 You said I grew on ya 
 Turns out that we are all the one solution go 
 Im coming at you well 
 You are the cat too and 
 I like the sound of your articulations 
 Want to arouse her and 
 Maybe espouse her well 
 She showed me love without the stipulations 
 I wanna lean on ya 
 Get Jan and Dean on ya 
 Its time to sway a little mass perception 
 I like you cheeky well 
 So Mozambiquey and 
 I think the world could use a clear connection 
 This I know Hey this I know 
 Would you like to goLucy Rebar 
 Shes a friend of mine 
 Later shell go 
 Back and redefine the line 
 Its getting longer all the time 
 Drinkin sunshine 
 She likes the taste of it 
 She had a gold mine 
 But then she wasted it away 
 You should have seen her yesterday 
 Send along the way 
 Nothing stops the ache 
 Sugar daddy 
 Loves her madly 
 Cosma Shiva 
 Got off 
 Made you a believer

 Annie wants a baby now 
 Annie wants a baby any way she can 
 Missing pieces 
 Shes got a lot of em 
 Time decreases 
 I wish I thought of em before 
 Before its time 
 To close the store 
 Distillation 
 A lonely sycophant 
 Some liberation 
 The only seed 
 We ever plant 
 I wanna help you 
 But I cant 
 No no 
 Love er leave er 
 God off 
 Neon soldiers 
 Left her 
 Now youve gotten older 
 Its time to redesign the sign 
 Sings along the wayI called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now 
 Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow 
 She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone 
 Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from 
 I dont take these things so personal 
 Anymore anymore 
 I dont think its irreversible 
 Anymore 
 Somebody hooted and they hollered Can I buy a vowel 
 Dont let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel 
 And when its not as it appears to be the flagrant foul 
 Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl 
 I dont think that its so terrible 
 I dont think that its unbearable 
 Tell me now I know that it just wont stop 
 You will find your flow when you go robot 
 I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin 
 Robots dont care where Ive been 
 Youve got to choose it to use it so let me plug it in 
 Robots are my next of kin 
 Sometimes I feel like Im a sentimental trooper 
 She cried so hard you know she looked like Alice Cooper 
 I dont think that its so personal 
 Im kissing high and low our bodys like two dominoes 
 Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes 
 Lets turn this cosplay holiday what we obey 
 And now were welcoming each other to this cabaret 
 Robots are my next of kinEasily lets get carried away 
 Easily lets get married today 
 Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat 
 Everything must go 
 A lickin stick is thicker when you break it to show 
 The story of a woman on the morning of a war 
 Remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for 
 Calling calling for something in the air 
 Calling calling I know you must be there 
 Easily lets get caught in a wave 
 Easily we wont get caught in a cave 
 Shao Lins shaking for the sake of his soul 
 Looking mighty tired of all the thing that you own 
 I cant tell you who to idolize 
 You think its almost over but its only on the rise 
 Throw me to the wolves because theres order in the pack 
 Throw me to the sky because I know Im coming back 
 I dont want to be your little research monkey boy 
 The creature that I am is only going to destroy 
 EasilyI met a man in a rock and roll band 
 He said Wont you come with me 
 I let him know that I could not go 
 You see I get mine for free 
 We are all just soldiers 
 In this battlefield of life 
 One thing thats for certain 
 Is my burning appetite 
 Step inside the emotional ride 
 I could use some company 
 Illusionary is so damn scary 
 I call my best friend Flea 
 This Ticonderoga 
 Is an element that shines 
 Connected by the great unknown 
 Between us there are lines 
 Yes I told her that Im the older cat 
 Can I scratch your back all day 
 I would not have it any other way 
 Well means so much to me 
 Can you see the we 
 What are we ever gonna do 
 When all I want to be is next to you 
 I took a girl from the underworld 
 And I held her way too tight 
 When its all been said and done 
 She was not up for the fight 
 In this open field of time 
 Hoping to get with you 
 When you get right with your mind 
 Its my favorite so I savor it 
 I must report that life is short 
 So of your love Ill take ten quarts 
 Well theres no end to this 
 Dont pretend to miss 
 You and you would not repent 
 For sitting on my elephant 
 And am I crazy to join the lazy zoo 
 All these human butterflies 
 And cactus flowers swollen eyes 
 And I want the devils share 
 Of you I do declare 
 Again Im asking can I do 
 When all these animals 
 Want to be just like you 
 I met a girl with long black hair 
 And she opened up so wide 
 A daffodil growing in Brazil 
 And I picked her for my bride 
 In this epic loving flight 
 And no one that I know 
 Has ever really done it right 
 Done it right 
 Done it rightHey yeah 
 Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways 
 But we do it with compassion and dont believe in age 
 Travel round the world getting naked on the stage 
 Busting people out of their everyday cage 
 We like to think we make a sad man happy 
 And we like to make proud our mammy and pappy 
 Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul 
 Were the modern day braves with one strong hold 
 Through the world of song our boldness is exposed 
 Im talking bout my buddies  funk it up Fishbone 
 Hey yeah 
 Good good time boys 
 Make me feel good 
 Give me good times 
 Our devotion to emotion is more than evident 
 To the minds that are open its you we represent 
 We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent 
 One day the good time boys might just be president 
 Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space 
 Our swingings gonna shatter every stone cold face 
 Now you may not know the exact reason why 
 A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky 
 Making more than money more than money can buy 
 Stop and take a listen to the monsters try 
 Got me boning 
 Im gonna try try try try try 
 Shes a shes a shes a white girl 
 If you dont believe me you can ask John Doe 
 Cause his heart is made of glory his voice is made of gold 
 Hell tell you in a minute about the men he knows 
 Hell tell you bout a band called fIREHOSE 
 To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit 
 We play it out loud for everyone to hear it 
 Building up our brains with the supernatural powers 
 We take it from the trees and the mighty Watts Towers 
 Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours 
 Were the best of the west and the west is ours 
 Rock it to the bottom 
 Lets funk it to the bottom 
 Lets rock it to the bottom 
 LetsLife is my friend 
 Rake it up to take it in 
 Wrap me in your cinnamon 
 Especially in Michigan 
  Well I could be your friend 
 White clouds Im in 
 A midden full of fishermen 
 Cmon Huckleberry Finn 
 Show me how to make her grin 
  Well Im in Michigan 
 Cry me a future 
 Where the revelations run amok 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Lions and tigers come running 
 Just to steal your luck 
 A rainy Lithuanian 
 Whos dancing as an Indian 
 Painted in my tiger skin 
 Especially in Michigan 
 Double chins and bowling pins 
 Unholy Presbyterians 
 Land is full of medicine 
 I find it when Im slipping in 
  All into Michigan 
 The tainted new librarian 
 Who fainted when she tucked you in 
 Lets float away like zeppelins 
 On stoic gusts of Northern wind 
 Out on the farm well be 
 Swimming with the mother duck 
 Deep in the midden where 
 Life is my friend 
 Underwater violins 
 Order now from Ho Chi Min 
 A porcelain that comes in twins 
  When Im in Michigan 
 Throw me in the looney bin 
 Cause I can take it on the chin 
 The cleavage of your pillow skin 
 Is moving like a violin 
 Just to steal your luckFuck you 
 Fuck your whole family and your bare legged kids 
 Fuck you 
 Fuck your little sister and your little brother 
 Fuck all your friends and everyone 
 Fuck your little puppy and your puppy dog 
 Fuck youI cant rest in war 
 Will you be my friend 
 Dark Ages never change 
 Well I cant comprehend 
 Kiss me we self destruct 
 Can you hear me Lord 
 Yes I think were fucked 
 But I cant rest in war 
 Righteous and the wicked on the war and peace 
 The righteous and the wicked war and peace 
 The killing fist of the human beast 
 POP Prodigies of peace 
 Hear me when Im calling you from my knees 
 I am praying for a better day oh yeah 
 I am praying for a better day anyway oh yeah 
 I am praying for a better day okay 
 Holy Mother Earth 
 Crying into space 
 Tears on her pretty face 
 For she has been raped 
 Killing your future blood 
 Fill her with disease 
 Global abortion please 
 That is what she needs 
 Playing for a better day every way 
 Are we fireflies 
 Flashing in the night 
 Big thunder rumble fish 
 Did you get it right 
 Headstrong battle song 
 Exploding souls be gone 
 Marvin Gaye my love 
 Where did we go wrong 
 POP Prodigies Of Peace 
 I am praying for a better day yeah 
 1 2 crank it 1 this is it 2 3Things will never be the same 
 Still Im awfully glad I came 
 Resonating in the shape of things to come 
 Never waiting when I know theres only one 
 Messed it up but rest assured 
 No one ever thinks theyre cured 
 Just a minute while I reinvent myself 
 Make it up and then I take it off the shelf 
 Over the laws of light 
 Over the moon by midnight 
 Lets do it all this time 
 Everyone wishing well we go and 
 Everyone knows Anything goes and now 
 We are the Lotus kids 
 Oh better take note of this 
 For the story 
 The rising moon is on the shine 
 The blood of scorpios and nine 
 Like the fear thats in eyes of every doe 
 Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know 
 Is it safe inside your head 
 Songs to serenade the dead 
 All along I said I know no enemies 
 Mix it up until there are no pedigrees 
 Into the shadow show and 
 Enter the rolling tide 
 Over the ocean so wide 
 Everyone wishing well we goI used to shout across the room to you 
 And youd come dancing like a fool 
 Shuffle step you funky mother 
 Come to me all warm as covers 
 Rest with me my lovely brother 
 For you see there is no other 
 Memory so sad and sweet 
 Ill see you soon save me a seat 
 Oh well Im crying 
 Oh now my lovely man 
 Oh yes Im crying 
 Oh now and no one can 
 Well ever fill the 
 The hole you left my man 
 Ill see you later 
 My lovely man if I can 
 In my room Im all alone 
 Waiting for you to get home 
 I listen to Roberta Flack 
 But I know you wont come back 
 Just in case you never knew 
 I miss you Slim I love you too 
 Oh see my heart its black and blue 
 When I die I will find you 
 Well Im crying 
 My lovely man yeah 
 Well Im crying yeah 
 They all know yeah 
 Oh I miss you been down 
 My lovely man 
 We have some good time 
 YeahThats right youre right 
 We will do our thing tonight alright 
 But take me through the future 
 It’s time youre fine 
 Just another colorcoded crime 
 Incision and a suture 
 You told my friend 
 We would get it on no matter when 
 A supercavitation 
 Lets go you show 
 Me something no one will ever know 
 A love hallucination 
 Another lonely superstar 
 To get away inside your car 
 Take it much too far 
 Surrender to the brave inside 
 A lover that another tried 
 Take it to my ride 
 You dont have to keep it if its mine 
 Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car 
 Another place maybe another time 
 Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried 
 Complete repeat 
 Sitting in your car and on your street 
 Lost in California 
 Let’s steal this wheel 
 Take a spin to find out how we feel 
 Just around the corner 
 Slow down for sound 
 Turn it up and no we cant be found 
 The body that we transcend 
 Asleep you weep 
 Find out that the trick is never cheap 
 A melancholy girlfriend 
 Thats right youre right 
 Drive the constellation 
 Its time youre fine 
 The song is Fascination 
 The lover that another tried 
 A MayDecember might not be so smart 
 Arrivals that we wish would not depart 
 Dont be late cause youre my savior 
 Make it great whatever stays 
 Golden Gate my rearranger 
 Hold my name inside your raysThis is the kitt I cant compare 
 A delicate new arrival 
 Check the commute I do declare 
 Lets sing a new revival 
 Chemical circus at the pub 
 Mentally shes departed 
 Cut me a check Ill cut your rug 
 Later well get bombarded 
 Cause everybody knows 
 The game is full of highs and lows 
 Like your mother said 
 Girl your father is dead 
 Everybody knows 
 That life is full of highs and lows 
 Is there always red 
 In your wedding bed 
 Officer please I just got there 
 Traveled from door to door 
 Havent you seen my girlfriends hair 
 What are we looking for 
 This is the kitt I cant compare 
 I think we have our bible 
 Take me to the shore 
 Show me what its for 
 The game is full of cons and pros 
 Girl your fathers dead 
 Everybody knowsOoh 
 Readymade readymade 
 Steady as the rhythm rolls 
 And this is how the story goes 
 I got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona 
 Were gonna rocket to Ramones in the city of Pomona 
 Oh readymade readymade 
 Uh And if I give to you my second sight 
 You got it 
 Uh And if I stay the course Ill stay the night 
 Come get it 
 Baby oughta celebrate 
 And now its time to deviate 
 I got a sister making babies with a black and decker blowtorch 
 We gonna flop it all night in the middle of her back porch 
 Yeah readymade readymade 
 Get me out to celebrate 
 Oh clean it up Johnny 
 Rocking for the sake of slade 
 Listen but dont be afraid 
 I got a brother making trouble  in the state of California 
 I wish I knew another way but Im gonna have to clone ya 
 Rock it for the circus slave 
 Come get itOne day while bathing in the sea 
 My talking dolphin spoke to me 
 He spoke to me in symphony 
 From freedoms peace beneath the sea 
 He looked to me eyes full of love 
 Said Yes we live behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 The sun goes up 
 And the sun gets down 
 But like the heart of the sun 
 My heart continues to pound 
 Now while I shower in the rain 
 I watch my dolphin swim away 
 The one who listens to the surf 
 Can feel the pulse beat of the earth 
 And like my dolphin swims so free 
 The sun does swim into the sea 
 An island flying through the sky 
 One day your son might ask you why 
 And if your son should be a girl 
 She too might ask you of this world 
 The sun shines sweet upon your beach 
 And yes my dolphin loves to teach 
 Behind the sunPersistant mystic faults my vision 
 Its like always this point of collision 
 Its raining in my cranium 
 My head feels like a stadium 
 3 pounds of grain 
 About to burst 
 Inside my 3 pound universe 
 These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind 
 Symbols Ive been given to express my goal 
 Always come up short 
 You know they just dont get that low 
 Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision 
 Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation 
 Cleaner than light 
 Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000 
 Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers 
 Of suffering succotash 
 Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation frustration 
 Alone in the constellation of alienation 
 Detached from empty conversation 
 I wait 
 I wait for the wave to breakHair so smooth black as coal 
 Aw baby the way you sway 
 You wear the dress so very blue 
 That you take my blues away 
 She comes and goes that I know 
 She cums at least once a day 
 I cant resist I kiss your lips 
 Youre my sexy Mexican maid 
 She comes 
 Let me please get on my knees 
 I come alone 
 When I wake up in the morning 
 She greets me where I lay 
 I look outside to find 
 Its a bright and sunny day 
 So serene she gives to me 
 My toast and marmalade 
 What more can I say 
 Shes my sexy Mexican maid 
 She puts me in a bubble bath 
 She tickles me and I laugh 
 She washes me until Im clean 
 Then she does a little sexy dance 
 Happy to feel my hand go slap 
 Upon her sexy ass 
 We make fun so very slow 
 Then we make it very fast 
 Oh let me pleaseOh mercy mercy mercy me 
 I look around I need another remedy 
 The I dont know is philosophy 
 Better yet Ill let you get ahead of me 
 Oh mercy mercy mercy me 
 Come around I need another enemy 
 Anyone could clearly see 
 A summer breeze is part of my anatomy 
 When its written in Britain 
 We get a little smitten 
 Like a kitten a cuddle is where Im benefitin 
 Any higher the fire would have to petrify her 
 Upon the wire the flayer is gonna satisfy her 
 My love is forever 
 My love it can feel this 
 My breathless defender 
 Step froward and steal this 
 Mercy mercy mercy me 
 Comin down I gotta catch the gravity 
 Even though we disagree 
 Give a kiss cause life could be the death of me 
 Acrobatic the static is getting to dramatic 
 Comin down with the system 
 Well get it systematic 
 Fascilitatin the maiden my love is circulating 
 Rejuvenating the fading but never dilating 
 Lovin on the color of an Emily 
 Easy as a guarantee 
 Better yet Ill show you what you wanna see 
 I want you to feel this 
 We aim to forever I want you to feel this 
 My gentle defender 
 Step froward and steal thisPTboat on the way to Havana 
 I used to make a living man 
 Pickin the banana 
 Now Im a guide for the CIA 
 Hooray for the USA 
 Baby baby make me a loco 
 Baby baby make me a mambo 
 Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show 
 First stop Havana au gogo 
 Hooray for HavanaPeople keep on learnin 
 Soldiers keep on warrin 
 World keep on turnin

 Powers keep on lyin 
 While your people keep on dyin 
 Im so darn glad he let me try it again 
 Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
 Im so glad that I know more than I knew then 
 Gonna keep on tryin 
 Til I reach the highest ground 
 Teachers keep on teachin 
 Preachers keep on preachin 
 Oh no 
 Lovers keep on lovin 
 Believers keep on believin 
 Sleepers just stop sleepin 
 Cause it wont be too long 
 Im so glad that he let me try it again 
 Til I reach my highest ground 
 No ones gonna bring me down 
 Dont you let nobody bring you down 
 God is gonna show you higher ground 
 Hes the only friend you have aroundTheres a port on a western bay 
 And it serves a hundred ships a day 
 Lonely sailors pass the time away 
 And talk about their homes 
 And theres a girl in this harbor town 
 And she works layin whiskey down 
 They say Brandy fetch another round 
 She serves them whiskey and wine 
 The sailors say Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 What a good wife you would be such a fine girl 
 Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea 
 Doodaditdooda 
 Ditdoodaditdoodadit 
 Brandy wears a braided chain 
 Made of finest silver from the north of Spain 
 A locket that bears the name 
 Of the man that Brandy loves 
 He came on a summers day 
 Bringin gifts from far away 
 But he made it clear he couldnt stay 
 No harbor was his home 
 The sailor saidn Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 But my life my lover my lady is the sea 
 Yeah Brandy used to watch his eyes 
 When he told his sailor stories 
 She could feel the ocean foam rise 
 She saw its ragin glory 
 But he had always told the truth lord he was an honest man 
 And Brandy does her best to understand 
 At night when the bars close down 
 Brandy walks through a silent town 
 And loves a man whos not around 
 She still can hear him say 
 She hears him say Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 But my life my lover my lady is the seaMagpies on fire 
 Making love like little wolves 
 Out on the porch 
 Can lead to medicine 
 Oh well Im game 
 For anything at all 
 Scarecrows a liar 
 Spins a yarn and no one 
 Ever checked it out 
 To see if it was real 
 Sold you the moon 
 Now its time to fall 
 All along 
 Its like a bird 
 Whos trapped alone 
 Inside your cage love 
 What more do you want 
 How much more can you take 
 I love my mistakes 
 Ive been here before 
 All and all 
 Its just the call 
 Of something wild 
 Beyond your room 
 Theres a changing 
 Of the major chord 
 Your minor threat 
 Will do love 
 My gun misfired 
 Shot myself instead 
 I guess I always knew 
 Id be the one to lose 
 That screen door slams 
 Time to make a move 
 All in all its like the bird trapped alone inside the cage love 
 A bird whos born 
 To live at half your age girl 
 A bird whos 
 Never really had a say 
 Least of all 
 Shes like a bird 
 Whos now been freed 
 From someones cageWhat ever never knew 
 That I could feel so good 
 Smile in your eyes 
 What ever never knew 
 That I could walk through wood 
 I guess I never tried 
 A million years old 
 But just a little girl 
 Vibin off the gong 
 Rubbin on the bowls 
 Make you float around 
 Make your lovin strong 
 And when we get 
 In the same place 
 At the same time 
 It is your grace 
 That I want to 
 Fall right into now 
 To love avow 
 Im falling into grace with you 
 Im falling into guru muhk 
 She moves in a rapture 
 That her capsule might 
 Land on your star

 The the twostep goes from intuition that is my liquid fare 
 We are all in favor of the opening 
 Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull 
 Truth be told we let the good times roll 
 Receive it and believe it 
 And its moaning and creating love 
 Tender titilations 
 Im a fish and I can swim all day 
 I can swim in so many ways 
 Make it up as I go along 
 That way it is never wrong

 There must have been a hundred miles 
 Or any of a hundred styles 
 Its not about the smile you wear but 
 The way we make out 
 When I was an allaloner 
 Nothing but a two beach comber 
 Anybody seen the sky 
 Im wide awake now 
 Working the beat as we speak 
 Working the belle du monde 
 Believe in the havoc we wreak 
 Believing  Is that so wrong Can I get my codependent 
 Come on 
 Must have been a hundred miles 
 Any of a hundred styles 
 Gonna get ya 
 Listen to me what I said 
 And try to get it through your head 
 A little bit of circumstance and 
 A chance to make out 
 Living in a citadel 
 Its hard enough to be yourself 
 Waiting for the bell to toll and 
 Im wide awake nowCabron cabron 
 Cabron cabron 
 I see you in the park 
 Youre always wearing Dodger blue 
 Mad doggin me and 
 Anyone from any other crew 
 I am small but I am strong 
 Ill get it on with you 
 If you want me to 
 What else can I do 
 Everyone would take a cue 
 From anything you do 
 If you want them to 
 What else can they do 
 I dont want to fight 
 I want to get along with you 
 This time of nights for singin 
 Songs about the local news 
 Ill come around and make peace 
 Get down have a barbecue 
 Lets keep the moon awake 
 And do electric boogaloo 
 You see Im just like you 
 If you only knew 
 That Im just like you 
 All the world would 
 Take a cue from anything you do 
 That theyre just like you 
 What else can I do 
 Cause Im just like you

 Tugboat Sheila

 She told me too 
 And show me what to do 
 Our Maggie makes it in a cloud 
 I said hey now 
 We gotta make it rain somehow 
 She told me to 
 And showed me what to do 
 She knows how to make it loud 
 Rain dance Maggie 
 Advances to the final 
 Who knew that she had the goods 
 Little did I know her body 
 Was warm delicious vinyl 
 To your neck of the woods 
 I want to lick a little bit 
 Hey now 
 You got the wrong girl 
 But not for long girl

 I want to rock this rowdy crowd 
 But not for long girl

 Cause Ill be gone bye bye bye yeah 
 Bye bye bye girl 
 Bye bye bye girlJaney 
 You are my 
 Victorian machinery 
 Breath yourself to life 
 Later 
 Your tender shape 
 Is bending like the scenery 
 Ride you like a bike 
 You be the sail 
 And baby Ill be the rudder 
 We could make it all day 
 Until it turns into butter 
 I saw your face 
 A seminal pleasure 
 I will love you forever 
 When I heeded your call 
 And every heavy endeavor 
 Ill keep your place 
 Janey 
 Coming down 
 The mountain like a buffalo 
 Seeds deep in your eyes 
 Crazy 
 But then again 
 A girl could like it rough you know 
 Makes up for her size 
 When I saw your all today 
 You be the shack 
 And baby Ill be the desert 
 There is nothing to lack 
 When there is nothing to measure 
 Its all space 
 You are my victorian machinery 
 Nah nah nah nah nah 
 Jaded 
 Make a fist and knock me on the mood again 
 Leave yourself to lie 
 Make me feel like I want more than you again 
 Rock me like the vibe 
 Sing along just like they do in Budapest 
 On the rise 
 Its all all spaceI got dosed by you and 
 Closer than most to you and 
 What am I sposed to do 
 Take it away I never had it anyway 
 Take it away and everything will be okay 
 In you a star is born and 
 You cut a perfect form and 
 Someone forever warm 
 Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on 
 Way up on the mountain where she died 
 All I ever wanted was your life 
 Deep inside the canyon I cant hide 
 Show love with no remorse and 
 Climb onto your sea horse and 
 This ride is right on course 
 This is the way I wanted it to be with you 
 This is the way I knew that it would be with you 
 I got dosed by you and 
 Take it away and everything will be ok 
 All I ever wanted was your lifeGive it up to this planet full of strife 
 Were the brothers cup cuttin sharp as a knife 
 With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap 
 The cups went up like a natural fact 
 It was our shoulder space 
 That made the perfect place 
 For the magic of the cup 
 To style out with grace 
 With a tight turn twist 
 And a slight swerve swank 
 The brothers cup kissed 
 With a kick ass clank 
 We are the brothers cup 
 We like to get it up 
 Give it up to this planet full of strife 
 So love all your brothers 
 And love all your sisters 
 Love all the misses 
 And love all the misters 
 Dont be shy when youre sharin your kisses 
 The brothers cup kiss 
 And we aint sissies 
 It is our notion that the perfect peace potion 
 Can be found in the wake of the green seas motion 
 The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean 
 Is the cradle of peace its the perfect peace motion 
 With the power of the cup we are about to astound 
 All your preconceptions they will come unbound 
 We are the brothers cup coming to your town 
 Bringing tubs of love were going to spread it aroundIm an ocean 
 In your bedroom 
 Make you feel warm make you want to reassume 
 Now we know it all for sure 
 Im a dance hall 
 Dirty breakbeat 
 Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet 
 Not alone Ill be there 
 Tell me when you want to go 
 Im a meth lab 
 First rehab 
 Take it all off and step inside the running cab 
 Theres a love that knows the way 
 Im the rainbow 
 In your jail cell 
 All the memories of everything youve ever smelled 
 Not alone 
 Ill be there tell me when you wanna go 
 So sideways falling 
 More will be revealed my friend 
 Sideways falling Dont forget me I cant hide it 
 More will be revealed my friend Come again get me excited 
 Im an inbred 
 And a pothead 
 Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed 
 I could show you 
 To the free field 
 Overcome and more will always be revealed 
 More will be revealed my friend 
 Theres a match now let me light it 
 Im the bloodstain 
 On your shirt sleeve 
 Coming down and more are coming to believe 
 Make the hair stand 
 Up on your arm 
 Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm 
 Come again and tell me when you wanna go 
 More will be revealed my friendSitting on a sack of beans 
 Sitting down in New Orleans 
 You wouldnt believe what Ive seen 
 Sitting on that sack of beans 
 Lunatics on pogo sticks 
 Another southern fried freak on a crucifix 
 Hicks dont mix with politics 
 People on the street just kicking to the licks 
 Yes my favorite place to be 
 Is not a land called Honalee 
 Mentally or physically 
 I wanna be in New Orleans 
 Oh good brother just when I thought 
 That I had seen it all 
 My eyes popped out my dick got hard 
 And I dropped my jaw 
 I saw a bird walking down the block 
 Name Apache Rose Peacock 
 I could not speak I was in shock 
 I told my knees to please not knock 
 A little boy came along 
 Name of Louis Armstrong 
 Said that girl who left me silly 
 She liked the looks of me and my willy 
 So I found her in the quarter 
 Good God how I adored her 
 Oh she made me feel so cozy 
 When she told me I could call her Rosey 
 I kiss your hair your skin so bare 
 Ill take you with me girl anywhere 
 You fare well in stormy weather 
 I never met a girl that I like better 
 Twinkle twinkle little star 
 Shining down on my blue car 
 Driving down the boulevard 
 She was soft and I was hard 
 Apache Rose gotta rocking peacock 
 Hottest ass on the goddamn block 
 Rocking to the beat of the funkyass Meters 
 She has one of those builtin heaters 
 Voodoo gurus casting their spells 
 Cockatoo drag queens shaking their bells 
 Silver sound escapes the trumpet 
 Watch your leg someone might hump it 
 Chicken strut your butt lets rock 
 Getting it on under your frock 
 Flowing like a flame all through the night 
 My girls insane but its all right 
 I wanna be in New OrleansWoop woop Ha 
 Junior pimp at the old café 
 Got to chase those girls around 
 Westbound drunk with lots to say 
 But he never makes a sound 
 Hustlers get what they deserve 
 But its always half the gate 
 Good things come to those who wait 
 Like an expiration date 
 See you around Ill see you around 
 Ill play all night cant get uptight 
 Ill lead all your mind games astray 
 When I see you around Ill see you around 
 See you so long goodbye hooray 
 Awww 
 Curb your tongue oh scallywag 
 Because you got no flag to wave 
 Save your breath for the black and white 
 Every dog will have its day 
 When I see you around Ill see you around 
 Aw yeah 
 Ill see you around Ill see you around 
 Well Ill see you around Ill see you around 
 Ill see you around 
 Goodbye and hooray 
 When I see you around Ill see you around oh nah nah nah noMe and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friends 
 Me and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friends 
 Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod well 
 Thats my friend and my friendss named Bob 
 Like the devil knows hell I know Bobby well 
 Well enough to tell you bout his sixtyseven smells 
 Well enough to tell you hes a hella swella fella 
 Well enough to tell you that we know each other better than we know our selves 
 Like freaks of a feather we rock together 
 I know Bobby well but I think he knows me better 
 Hes as close to me as a friend can be 
 Well Ill be standing by my buddy hell be standing by me 
 Just another half of the twoheaded freak 
 But I need him like my heart needs to beat 
 At this point in this friendly verse 
 Ive gotta sing a little something that I havent rehearsed 
 Its about my man and his name is Hillel 
 For whom my love is soulbrother sacred 
 Take it Huckleberry 
 Slim boy take it 
 Jackys eyes are closed but hes right on course 
 Because hes guided by the invisible force 
 He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybodys Porsche 
 Hes a working class drummer hes as strong as a horse 
 Me and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friendsOh yeah yeah woah yeah 
 Arthur J did indicate 
 The boulevard would never be 
 So full of love and life again ay 
 Hot as Hades early eighties 
 Sing another song and make me 
 Feel like Im in love again ay 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh please dont strip my mind 
 Leave something behind 
 Please dont strip my mind 
 Oh yeah yeah woah yeah 
 All in favor sign the waiver

 Blow another top and sing ay 
 El Dorado won the lotto 
 All that cash and not a clue 
 But now you know what Ive been through ay 
 Please dont strip my mindStep right up and listen please 
 Youre gonna get it with the greatest of ease 
 Well everybody gather round 
 All aboard the underground 
 Youve got to get in before you get out 
 And getting out is what its gonna be about 
 If you find that you are blind 
 Open your bashful mind 
 Let my band step inside 
 And take you on a cosmic ride 
 With honest sounds Ill paint your brain 
 For in this song I do proclaim 
 That once aboard this moving train 
 Ill do my best to ease your pain 
 Slinky as my speech may be 
 On this trip youll ride for free 
 As we leave our trailer spots 
 Well outer space is lots of dots 
 This axis bold as love you see 
 Comes and goes too easily 
 Space is king or so I sing 
 Subway to Venus 
 Once aboard and feeling smooth 
 Like a liquid you will ooze 
 Into a state of mind that soothes 
 Aw be my quest inside my groove 
 Cause what Ive got to give to you 
 Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu 
 Ill make you wiggle like a wiggly worm 
 Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm 
 Lifes too short to be in a hole 
 So bust into your funkiest stroll 
 Is gonna make you wanna boogalooluau 
 Take your body shake it around 
 Do the dog on the ground 
 And if I cant make you dance 
 I guess Ill just have to make you piss your pants 
 Subway to VenusSay what you need to say 
 Make it clear 
 Make it great 
 Cause its not too late 
 And theres no mistake 
 When you shine 
 Shake it for me anyway 
 Now we crash the gate 
 To investigate 
 Your fate 
 Pleasure to meet you 
 Got so much more 
 To offer the world 
 See whats in store 
 Stay all day 
 Someone to love 
 Thats my boy chip chop 
 Open the doors 
 And we never close shop 
 Take what you need to take 
 To forsake 
 Make it for me anyway 
 When we fill the void 
 That is Pink As Floyd 
 To destroy 
 Records that we file away 
 And Ill clean the slate 
 As I calculate 
 And you shine as you redefine 
 Your time just another time of day 
 Do you feel the spark 
 When you play the part 
 Superstar 
 Fake it for me anyway 
 Time to tell them all 
 Without hem or haw 
 No applause 
 Tell them how to generate 
 How to raise the bar 
 How to keep it hard 
 To be alive make it for me anyway 
 If you care at all 
 You will bare it all 
 You will grind shake it for me anyway 
 Born to play the part 
 Dying for your art 
 Cause its time 
 Take it for me anyway 
 You will clear the air 
 With a single stare 
 Your fateGive it up to this time full of strife 
 Get down you might be fucking with the song of life 
 Extend your deeper senses there will be no fight 
 At the never ending ocean of perfect insights 
 Round your molecule beam with a halo of light 
 The animated aura will give delight 
 Soon your every single worry will be out of sight 
 With the power of It we are about to astound 
 All your preconceptions they will come unbound 
 Listen very close my inner voice expounds 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sound 
 Yes we deliver the truth to our musical birth 
 A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth 
 People have to know that its not about money 
 Cash is not the way to make your life sunny 
 There is no need if you got the soul seed 
 Love life and peace it can only begin 
 When you know in your heart that the change is within 
 Love all your brothers and love all your sisters 
 Love all the missus and love all the misses 
 And dont be shy when youre sharing your kisses 
 Greed jealousy gets boos and hisses 
 What it is what it is so much to be found 
 What it is what it is groove down to the sounds 
 What it is what it is what it is in a song 
 What it is what it is you can do no wrong 
 Balance your life with the right kind of foods 
 To eat a sad cow is to eat another you 
 Well thats an unfair rap its unforgivably rude 
 Itll put your karma in the worst of moods 
 Someones drinking booze and taking too many ludes 
 Cause when you cop dont you cop an attitude 
 And thats an ugly thing its not the real you 
 So please yall take some sound advice 
 Be yourself clear your mind make a sacrifice 
 The always sober you is especially nice 
 Dont loot dont shout give comet the boot 
 I love it kickin back and playin my bamboo flute 
 Refuse to fight wars for political whores 
 Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores 
 It is my notion that the perfect peace potion 
 Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean 
 The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean 
 Is the cradle of peace its the perfect peace potion 
 There you will find it with sweet sea creatures 
 The smile of a dolphin is a builtin feature 
 We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher 
 Good morning class how very nice to meet you 
 Open up your hearts to the planets to the stars 
 With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars 
 You know Einstein did while Hitler hid 
 Now Albert lives forever in every single kid 
 But with Adolph Hitler we are permanently rid 
 Picasso Mister Dali and my man Jimi Hendrix 
 These cool brothers make the world go round 
 Yeah they do it with art and Jimi did it with sound 
 But by all these men it was found 
 Each and every person can be just as renowned 
 Dont let the worlds racist creeds give your pretty face a frown 
 Stand up for equal rights I mean buckle down 
 Go spread the word from town to town 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sounds 
 Now that youve heard what it is in a song 
 From here on in you can do no wrongspoken 
 Could you turn up the track a little bit please 
 sung 
 My mouth fell open 
 Hoping that the truth would not be true 
 Refuse the news 
 Im feeling sick now 
 What the fuck am I supposed to do 
 Just lose and lose 
 First time I saw you 
 You were sitting backstage in a dress 
 A perfect mess 
 You never knew this 
 But I wanted badly for you to 
 Requite my love 
 Left on the floor 
 Leaving your body 
 When highs are the lows 
 And lows are the way 
 So hard to stay 
 Guess now you know 
 I love you so 
 I liked your whiskers 
 And I liked the dimple in your chin 
 Your pale blue eyes 
 You painted pictures 
 Cause the one who hurts can give so much 
 You gave me such 
 I love you soWaking up dead inside of my head 
 Will never never do there is no med 
 No medicine to take 
 Ive had a chance to be insane 
 Asylum from the falling rain 
 Ive had a chance to break 
 Its so bad its got to be good 
 Mysterious girl misunderstood 
 Dressed like a wedding cake 
 Any other day and I might play 
 A funeral march for Bonnie Brae 
 Why try and run away 
 Slow cheetah come before for my forest 
 Looks like its on today 
 Slow cheetah come its so euphoric 
 No matter what they say 
 I know a girl she worked in a store 
 She knew not what her life was for 
 She barely knew her name 
 They tried to tell her she would never be 
 As happy as a girl in a magazine 
 She bought it with her pay 
 Everyone has so much to say 
 They talk talk talk their lives away 
 Dont even hesitate 
 Walking on down to the burial ground 
 Its a very old dance with a merry old sound 
 No matter what they sayBlood sugar suckerfish in my dish 
 How many pieces do you wish 
 Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side 
 Girl please me be my soul bride 
 Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite 
 Copulate to create a state of sexual light 
 Kissing her virginity my affinity 
 I mingle with the gods I mingle with divinity 
 Blood sugar baby 
 Shes magik sex magik sex magik 
 Blood sugar crazy 
 She has it sex magik sex magik 
 Glorious euphoria is my must 
 Erotic shock is a function of lust 
 Temporarily blind dimension to discover 
 In time each into the other 
 Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat 
 Fill a space in which two bodies float 
 Operatic by voice a fanatic by choice 
 Aromatic is the flower she must be moist 
 She magik sex magik sex magik 
 Blood sugar my girl 
 She magik sex magik sex magikSmile 
 When Im shy in ways 
 But I love 
 Everything of first impressions 
 Sweet successions 
 Been around for quite a while 
 I see you kept it versatile 
 Motivated to combine 
 Even when its bad its fine 
 Did she say something 
 That made you cry 
 Have you lost it all 
 The big fall 
 Oh so slowly 
 Comes back holy 
 Bishop takes a knight 
 But I will put up quite a fight 
 Here is your ham on rye 
 Elementary the chemistry 
 Means everything to me 
 The long progressions why 
 Set it off to collect knowledge 
 Quit a job 
 And go to college 
 All about the aftershock 
 Swedish Latin super funk 
 Moses of Manhattan 
 Made it great 
 Pain we celebrate 
 And I love 
 The long progression indiscretion 
 Heres your ham on rye 
 Elementary the chemistry means everything to me 
 In between the reasons 
 Are the psychedelic seasons 
 Simple as your stride 
 Information intimated 
 Elegant and integrated 
 Sweet your floors with pride 
 Smile 
 Cause its all a ride 
 All supplied 
 Everything about this session 
 And this long progression 
 Long progressions why 
 Long progressions whyI am just a lousy burn 
 Searching for the unknown crumb 
 The crumb the crumb 
 Nothing or someone to come 
 Come along illuminate my lust 
 Combust 
 Confucius might have been confused 
 And Buddha might have blown a fuse 
 I ooze 
 The muse 
 Meet me at the coffee shop 
 We can dance like Iggy Pop 
 Another go in the parking lot 
 Freak the cheek on your hotspot 
 Back and forth my bodys jerking 
 Will to thrill will not stop working 
 Work and work 
 Ill take you on a honeymoon 
 Jumping on a bed in a hotel room 
 The room 
 The groom 
 Freak the cheek on your hotspotLets make evil 
 Lets make good 
 Id do anything I could 
 Just to get you in my dirty wood 
 Go down on you 
 Seventeen and thirtyone 
 I am just my mothers son 
 Brown eyes and a silver tongue 
 All the mothers come undone 
 At the sight of me 
 The waters falling clear 
 Interiors deceive I fear 
 I think Ill kiss my shame away 
 My prudence is not dear 
 Inside out and feeling weird 
 Lets get soft 
 Lets get hard 
 Lets get off in my backyard 
 Where the desert wind 
 Will wash our skin 
 A lighter red 
 Lets make peace 
 Lets make war 
 Lets break into heaven for 
 A dance with heavens devils or 
 Is that more than you can store 
 Inside your head 
 I dont want to live alone 
 Get on my throne 
 Slay my shame 
 Lets get gentle 
 Lets get pissed 
 Get your knickers in a twist 
 Cause the angel and the devil kiss 
 They fell in love 
 Some seem dirty 
 Some stay clean 
 Something from a madmans dream 
 Am I really what I seem 
 Rising to my head like cream 
 It feels so strange 
 Slay my shameAll around the world 
 We could make time 
 Rompin and astompin 
 Cause Im in my prime 
 Born in the north 
 And sworn to entertain ya 
 Cause Im down for 
 The state of 
 Pennsylvania 
 I try not to whine but 
 I must warn ya 
 Bout the motherfuckin 
 Girls from 
 California

 Living in and out 
 Of a big fat suitcase 
 Bonafide ride

 And I have seen your love 
 You say hello and then I say I doOn a far away island 
 Of Salamasond 
 Yertle the turtle 
 Was king of the pond 
 A nice little pond 
 It was clean it was neat 
 The water was warm 
 There was plenty to eat 
 Until one day 
 The king of them all 
 Decided the kingdom 
 He ruled was too small 
 Im a ruler of all that I see 
 But I dont see enough 
 And thats the trouble with me 
 With this stone for a throne 
 I am too low down 
 I cannot look down 
 Upon the places beyond 
 So Yertle the turtle king 
 Lifted his hand 
 And Yertle the turtle king 
 He ordered all the turtles 
 Onto one anothers back 
 He piled them high 
 Into a ten turtle stack 
 Im Yertle the turtle 
 The things I now rule 
 Im king of a cow 
 Im king of a mule 
 Then down from below 
 In the great turtle stack 
 Came a burp from a plain 
 Little turtle named Mack 
 Just part of the throne 
 This burpin little turtle 
 Looked up and said I beg 
 Your pardon king Yertle 
 Ive pains in my back 
 My shoulders and my knees 
 How long must we stand 
 Here your majesty 
 Silence the king of the 
 Turtles barked back 
 To the bad burpin 
 Oh marvelous me for 
 I am ruler of all that I see 
 Yertle Yertle the turtle 
 Yertle Yertle the turtleStranded 
 Stranded 
 Stranded on the toilet bowl 
 What do you do when youre stranded 
 And there aint nothing on the roll 
 To prove youre a man 
 You must wipe it with your hand 
 Stranded on the toilet bowlIve got a mellowship Ive got a fellowship 
 Ive got a nonstop Yo swan hello chip 
 Born to adore the big bad bison 
 Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson 
 Popcorn peanuts looking at big butts 
 No I cannot keep my mouth shut 
 Rocking to the beat of the fabulous Forum 
 My Lakers I adore em 
 Blush my lady when I tell her 
 That I do indeed love to smell her 
 Sopping wet your pink umbrella 
 Do the dog with Isabella 
 Im so in love yes with an artist 
 Imagination hes the smartest 
 Robert Williams stroke and splatter 
 I attest to your gray matter 
 Living kings how true it rings 
 These are just a few of my favorite things 
 Good God wheres my sleigh now 
 Good God playing for days now 
 Good God well any day now 
 Good God take me away now 
 Good God the purple haze now 
 Good God the baddest of brains now 
 Good God riding my sleigh now 
 Being that Im the duke of my domain 
 My hat goes off to Mark Twain 
 Singing a song about what true men dont do 
 Killing another creature thats kind of blue 
 Writing about the world of the wild coyote 
 Good man Truman Capote 
 Talking about my thoughts cause they must grow 
 Cock my brain to shoot my load 
 Im on the porch cause I lost my house key 
 Pick up my book I read Bukowski 
 Can I get another kiss from you 
 Kiss me right here on my tattoo 
 Good God De Niros insane now 
 Good God racking my brain now 
 Good God take me away now take me away 
 Me my friends and the sex machine 
 Do unto others like my brother Bean 
 I know youve got a mother so give her a hug 
 I know youve got a mother with a whole lotta love 
 Billy sings and Basie swings 
 These are just a few HoI told you before stay away from my door 
 Dont give me that brother brother brother brother 
 The freaks on the phone wont leave me alone 
 So dont give me that brother brother brother brother 
 No 
 I I found out 
 Now that I showed you what I been through 
 Dont take nobodys word what you can do 
 There aint no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
 Now that I found out I know I can cry 
 Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
 Dont get you nowhere dont make you a man 
 I heard something bout my Ma and my Pa 
 They didnt want me so they made me a star 
 Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
 Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
 Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
 There aint no guru who can see through your eyes 
 Ive seen through junkies Ive been through it all 
 I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
 Dont let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
 No one can harm you feel your own pain 
 I I found this out

 One big mob ah yeah ah yeah 
 Eh bara mala ah yeah ah yeah 
 One big mob is 
 Ooze into into my noodle 
 East or west shepherd or poddle 
 Lady bug pine tree 
 To mingle with the bumblebee 
 A lover to the Sun 
 And a brother to the cool breeze 
 We live in the city 
 We live in the jungle 
 Its time to be drinking 
 A thimble humble 
 Everything you ever see 
 Is never more than you and me 
 Give it on into the beauty of the mystery 
 One big mob is all 
 One big mob in one big home 
 A broken home 
 Id like to share some air with you 
 Some air with you 
 A morning forest full of truths 
 The green is blue 
 The head thats getting pregnant lives 
 To give and give 
 What was I thinking in my head 
 The color red 
 Breaking hearts instead of bread 
 Something I said 
 Checkmated by frustration now 
 Need to be cut loose 
 A different kind of being lost 
 A sullen cost 
 Scrawled upon the wall 
 Of a bathroom stall 
 A stranger wrote a note 
 That spoke to all 
 One two 
 Buckle my shoe 
 Take care of me 
 Cause I might be you 
 Picaboo Street in Timbuktu 
 Do I need repeat 
 That a boy named Sue 
 Rockin to the beat 
 Of the kangaroo 
 Let me kiss your feet 
 And your forehead too 
 One big mob isCan I get your hand to write on 
 Just a piece of leg to bite on 
 What a night to fly my kite on 
 Do you want to flash your light on 
 Take a look its on display for you 
 Coming down No not today 
 Did you meet your fortune teller 
 Get it off with no propeller 
 Do it up its on with Stella 
 What a way to finally smell her 
 Picking up but not too strong for you 
 Take a piece and pass it on 
 Fly away on my Zephyr 
 I feel it more than ever 
 And in this perfect weather 
 Well find a place together 
 Fly on my wind 
 Rebel and a liberator 
 Find a way to be a skater 
 Rev it up to levitate her 
 Superfriendly aviator 
 In the water where I center my emotion 
 All the world can pass me by 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Do you 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Wont you 
 Were gonna live forever 
 ForeverSo we were down in Brazil and man that place is wild 
 We were in Rio de Janeiro and uh we had this this sort of uh 
 Securityguard type guy and he was supposed to take us around and say hey 
 Could you know could you take us to the 
 The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the 
 You know the street life of your town and he said sure so we we pull up to this hooker 
 And shes wearing some kind of a a bright green miniskirt and it turns out its a transsexual 
 And he says Get over here and she comes over and she thinks shes busted but shes not busted 
 Naw shes not busted he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say Hey whats up girl 
 I get out of bed 
 And I clear up my head 
 I dont want to go 
 But I do it instead 
 We are dreams 
 Within a dream 
 I get into bed 
 And I turn off my head 
 I started to float 
 Was it something she said 
 So I remember we got our drivers license and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson painted green and 
 Hollywood would get so crazy in the winterthe rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights 
 And well you know we smoked weed and wed go up in the hills and wed listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and 
 Well we would dream you know we would dream and we would talk about what we wanted to do and we would talk about girls and music 
 And you know Hillel wanted to be a rock starI didnt even know what that was I was like whatever you wanna do man Im coming with you 
 Im right with you my friend 
 Why in the world would you want it to be why would you wanna take it so so literally 
 All these things that come down from the sky raining upon your head make you stop and wonder why ah 
 Cant they just spell it out make it clear make it easy to read for the simple man like me 
 I dont think so 
 I reach out to my family and I say 
 Its not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky 
 With a punishing hand oh 
 Its about heaven in your heart

 Celebrated but undisturbed 
 Serenaded by the terror bird 
 Its seldom seen and its never heard oh 
 Never in the wrong time or wrong place 
 Desecration is the smile on my face 
 The love I made is the shape of my space 
 My face my face 
 Disintegrated by the rising sun 
 A rolling black out of oblivion and Id 
 Like to think that Im your number one oh 
 Rolling black out of oblivion 
 I wanna leave but I just get stuck 
 A broken record running low on luck 
 Theres heavy metal coming from your truck and I 
 Broken record running low on luck 
 We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise 
 Coca Cola doesnt do the justice she enjoys 
 We could all come up with something new to be destroyed 
 We could all go down 
 I love the feeling when it falls apart 
 Im slow to finish but Im quick to start and 
 Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark and Im 
 Slow to finish but I am quick to start

 Do you want me girl to be your thief 
 Oh baby just for you

 Swimming in the sound of Bow Wow Wow 
 Oh baby do me now

 Is she gonna curtsy 
 Give to me sweet sacred bliss 
 That mouth was made to 
 Your mouth was made to suck my kissSwing 
 Ive got a soul that cannot sleep 
 At night when something just aint right yo 
 Blood red but without sight 
 Exploding egos in the night 
 Mix like sticks of dynamite 
 Red black or white this is my fight 
 Come on courage lets be heard 
 Turn feelings into words 
 American equality has always been sour 
 An attitude I would like to devour 
 My name is peace this is my hour 
 Can I get just a little bit of power 
 The power of equality 
 Is not yet what it ought to be 
 ought to be 
 It fills me up like a hollow tree 
 hollow tree 
 Right or wrong my song is strong 
 You dont like it get along 
 Say what I want do what I can 
 Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan 
 I dont buy supremacy 
 A media chief you menace me 
 The people you say cause all the crime 
 Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime 
 Blackest anger whitest fear 
 Can you hear me Am I clear 
 Ive got tapes Ive got CDs 
 Ive got my 
 Public Enemy 
 My lilywhite ass is tickled pink 
 When I listen to the music that makes me think 
 Not another motherfucking politician 
 Doing nothing but something for his own ambition 
 Never touch the sound we make 
 Soulsacred love vows that we take 
 To create straight what is true 
 Yo hes with me and what I do 
 Madder than a motherfucker lick my finger 
 Cant forget cause the memory lingers 
 Count em off quick little piccadilly sickness 
 Take me to the hick oh eat my thickness 
 Ive got a welt from the Bible belt 
 Dealing with the hand that Ive been dealt 
 Sitting in the grip of a killing fist 
 Giving up blood just to exist 
 Rub me wrong and I get pissed 
 No I cannot get to this 
 People in pain I do not dig it 
 Change of brain for Mr Bigot 
 Little brother do you hear me 
 Have a heart oh come get near me 
 Misery is not my friend 
 But Ill break before I bend 
 What I see is insanity 
 Whatever happened to humanity 
 Whatever happened to humanityWell Im walking on down the road 
 But it cant be heaven 
 Cause the streets arent gold 
 And everybody knows what Bobby D was told 
 Im walkin on down the road 
 Groovin a tune straight out of the womb 
 Cause trust is a must to be a true blue dude 
 Thats a matter of fact dont be confused 
 Everybody knows true friends are few 
 Everybody come in everybody sing sing my song 
 Everybody knows everybody thinks that Ive done wrong 
 Well Im walking on down the road 
 And Im walkin on down the road 
 Like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs 
 A dude he cant lose when he lives on love 
 Like the bark on a tree 
 Like the skin on my knees 
 Im standin by my blood 
 Im walkin on down the roadIm afraid that Im never afraid 
 Ive got combat boots 
 And Im American made 
 For your eyes girl 
 Mormon lover on a delicate day 
 Gonna marry the boss 
 Get carried away 
 War cries girl 
 Im not immune to Canadian snow 
 Now teach me everything 
 That I should know 
 Your eyes girl 
 Freeze on the radio 
 Ive got to leave and more 
 Ive got to bleed into snow 
 Hold on 
 Let go 
 We know 
 Do you shine like a temple inside 
 Can I open your core 
 So gentle and wide 
 Like your eyes girl 
 Rack em up stretch em out 
 When theyre tight 
 This acetylene torch is giving me sight 
 Ive got to leave and alone 
 Black and blue from the hullabaloo 
 Do the caribou bite 
 When they look into you 
 And your eyes girl 
 We knowFind me in the suburbs 
 And the shadow of decay 
 Rolling rings of rubber 
 And the band begins to play 
 Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain 
 Can you see the rising of old yesterdays remains 
 Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest 
 Time dont stand a chance against this motor madness 
 Dont you worry baby 
 Im like Detroit Im crazy 
 Dont you worry baby Im like 
 The Stooges and J Dilla yeah 
 They tore this town apart 
 Put me back together well 
 I guess thats quite an art hit me 
 Henry won the war you see but not with pen or sword 
 He did it with the little thing I think its called a Ford 
 Everythings so hazy 
 Everythings so hazy ahhhWont somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive 
 To survive 
 Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes 
 Take away the tourniquet 
 I used to be so full of my confidence 
 I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go 
 More than ever I could use a coincidence 
 But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know 
 Hey ah yeah how long 
 I guess I ought to walk away 
 Hey ah yeah so long 
 What you gonna do today 
 I dont wanna have to but I will 
 If thats what Im supposed to do 
 We dont wanna set up for the kill 
 But thats what Im about to do 
 Later on Ill cut you off when youre screaming into the phone 
 Hard to own 
 Anyway I wanna let you know that everything is on hold 
 What you gonna do to me 
 You used to be so warm and affectionate 
 All the little things I used to hear my fairy say 
 But now youre quick to give in to your regret 
 Ill take the fall and now you gotta give it all away 
 Hey what would you say if I stayed 
 Stay for a while if I may 
 Say it again and Ill come around 
 But not for the last time 
 Hey what would you say if I changed 
 Change everything with my name 
 Play it again and Ill come around come around 
 But not for the last time not for the last time 
 And now youre quick to give into your regret 
 And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know 
 I guess you gotta walk away 
 Hey ah yeah how long 
 I guess you gotta get away 
 What you gonna do todayBrave from afar 
 When I hold you for country 
 Saved by a star 
 Can I hold you to one thing 
 Do you feel safe when 
 They tell you they sell you 
 Pray for your children 
 The shelter theyre building 
 Prime time the perfect crime 
 Bow my head the axe we grind 
 Ruse cruise Ps and Qs 
 I got beat up by the evening news 
 Deep hits the media blitz 
 Lost my mind to keep my wits 
 Maintain the same old same 
 Goodbye shiz and so long game 
 Brave from afar 
 Plain Jane the big campaign 
 Last detail has been restrained 
 Fraud fraud the lightning rod 
 See that sign time to applaud 
 The shelter theyre buildingStanding naked in your kitchen 
 Feeling free that I could be alive 
 Clearly Im a contradiction 
 Too young to be my wife 
 A peaceful storm is never hectic 
 Her mellow voice that I could be within 
 The uniform is anorexic 
 A jealous choice wont win 
 A metamorphosis samurai 
 You got a little lord fish 
 And you dont know why 
 I got a metamorphosis samurai 
 Paint your face cause Im a Blackfoot 
 I thought I counted up the fireflies 
 Close enough to get a good look 
 Time to mobilize 
 And I dont know why 
 Im a lonely lad 
 Ive lost myself out on the range 
 I dont remember much 
 So dont ask me Ive gone insane 
 Taking acid in a graveyard 
 Stealing food to keep the night alive 
 Every day I try to play hard 
 Even with my lies 
 The day they found you on a tour bus 
 The news was barren as a desert bone 
 The tabloids made a kind of small fuss 
 A couple pictures shown 
 Slowly turning into driftwood 
 No one ever wants to die alone 
 Thinking that a pretty gift could 
 Make you less unknown 
 Dirty sneakers on the pavement 
 The brilliant features of a common man 
 See the miracle of your life 
 No one ever can 
 See the world go by 
 The changes that we entertain 
 I dont recall it all 
 Remember I have gone insaneThe California animal is a bear 
 Angeleno but the devil may care 
 Summer  time to talk to and swear 
 Later maybe we could share some air 
 Ill take to you the movies there 
 We could walk through Leicester Square 
 What could be wetter than 
 An English girl American man 
 London in the summertime 
 Call me now use the satellite 
 Cuss me out and itll be all right 
 Hesitate but dont refuse 
 The choice is yours but you said choose 
 The look she used was green and sharp 
 Stabbed that boy all in his heart 
 Come what may the cosmos will 
 Take me up and down on Primirose Hill 
 Cuss me out and itll feel all right 
 Its all right now 
 Its all right 
 Down and out and itll sound all right 
 The California flower is a poppy child 
 Felony sends me all the gold in your smile 
 Drift away from anyone you can 
 Nothing ever goes according to plan 
 Though I know that every river bends 
 Time to say hello to snow on the Thames 
 Cuss me out and itll feel all rightGet on top get on top 
 Hit me come get me 
 I bite but she bit me 
 Gorilla Cuntilla 
 Sammy D and Salmonella 
 Come with me cause Im an ass killer 
 Youre ill but Im iller 
 Ill malinger on your block and 
 Give the finger to a cop and 
 Pick a lock before Ill knock and 
 Set you up to get on top 
 Complications of a mastermind 
 Last temptation of my kind 
 Extra planetary sign 
 When do we align 
 All in time 
 Right on 
 Get up and come sit up 
 I light up but she lit it 
 Grasshopper show stopper 
 The life of a wife swapper 
 Come with me cause Im a big bopper 
 You do but I wopper 
 Exterminate my cause 
 You want to draw some straws 
 Be the one to see my flaws 
 Make me bleed with painted claws 
 Get on top get on top 
 Speedballer Rhodes Scholar 
 Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar 
 Come with me cause Im a free faller 
 You hoot but I holler 
 Get on top

 All over town 
 Workin it out 
 When you want to 
 Soldiering my style and smiling 
 Turn it into whatever I choose 
 Take me now to the water 
 Dont be late I hear its gonna be so very great and 
 Out the door Im walkin like a runaway 
 All the reasons that I count of you cant haul away and 
 More and more Im walkin like a runaway 
 Kick it around 
 Stare at the ground 
 Breakin it down 
 Soldiering my desert shows on 
 Dance around do whatever I want to 
 Take me now its the water

 Out the door Im walkin like a runawayFlea

 She claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me fuck me 
 Every day when Im in the hay 
 I want to party on your pussy baby

 Or just turn me loose 
 I know whats right in life you better buckle down 
 Dont give up your fight in life you better buckle down 
 Two days with might in life you better buckle down 
 Leave dreams tonight in life you better buckle down 
 Cause I know whats right 
 Reds are 
 Back bills 
 I know I know I know whats right 
 I know I know I know whats rightThe curtain is open 
 A head to put dope in 
 Now we will come clean it 
 The future weve seen it 
 No no I know I said no no 
 Its like a dream that falls away 
 Into the night where we can play 
 Im on a train one happy day 
 Two eyes for sight three times I pray 
 Soda pop weve got to set up shop 
 And when the weather comes 
 Weve got a pressure drop 
 We dont know 
 But everyday I go 
 To see what I can bring 
 Into a cameo 
 Oh oh oh no 
 We believe We believe 
 Climb a tree for monkey business 
 Write a check out to forgiveness 
 All the world on half an acre 
 Pushing dirt into a quaker 
 The mission the method 
 The downfall arrested 
 Cause its not the first time 
 Nor is it the worst time 
 No no oh no 
 To see the bird without a care 
 For in a word its nice out there 
 In a tree my mama bear 
 Will be all right with proper care 
 Hey hey hey do 
 Boomerang into a bigger bang 
 A little cry of love because they cannot sing 
 Cherokee what did the pharaoh see 
 Another time and space another place to be 
 The motive the measure 
 The purpose the pleasure 
 The risk is it worth it 
 The disc is it perfect 
 I found you amongst them 
 The flower with young stem 
 Disparage the broken 
 The marriage elopinSay it loud 
 Im freaky styley 
 And Im proud 
 repeat many timesSome of us get a little and some a lot 
 Weve got to make due with what ever we got 
 We get it hot we cool it down and then we pass it around 
 You can dance for the sake of a golden day 
 Take a chance on getting rid of whatevers in your way 
 Next stop big hop its turning night into day 
 Sometimes when Im lying there all alone 
 I think of every little nothing that we could own 
 To overthrow all of you who have overgrown 
 All my friends 
 Like to spend 
 Days on end 
 On the mend 
 I turn to you I turn into and then I turn it again 
 All we know 
 Heavy load 
 Start to float 
 Without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again 
 Ive come to learn whatever time I can find to spend 
 Taking flight into whatever light we bend 
 Out in the street I get a beat and then I turn it to ten 
 Lace boots and the ladies of Kazakhstan 
 Kick em high to the sky 
 All of this just because we can 
 I turn to Cuba then Aruba then the Dominican 
 Two things I want to say now 
 You make it all okay now 
 I need to know that you are there 
 Weve got to move it if we want to do our best 
 Weve got to shake it if we want to keep it fresh 
 Im turning down all the heavy psychology 
 To cut a rug and I make no apology 
 I turn a cheek I turn a key and then I turn it for free 
 Weve got to move it just a little to hit the spot 
 A whirling dervish in a flurry a fox to trot 
 Come clown around a robot doing the astronaut 
 I need to know that you are thereListen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon we got high 
 Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space too much pride 
 Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut Soviet Spy 
 Every now and then when I remember to befriend the little things in life 
 Hey youre fine 
 I wanna listen to the radio 
 Driving down Calexico highway 
 And now I know the signs for sure 
 I want to share it all with Mary 
 Results are gonna vary now 
 Later on Ill read to you the things that Ive been needing to say goodbye 
 Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had tell no lies 
 Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off fore you die 
 Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky 
 Skinny brains and little stains upon your face teenage remains tell me more 
 Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time lets soar 
 I wanna listen to your radio 
 And now I know the signs for sure for sure 
 Results are gonna vary nowBlue jean baby LA lady 
 Seamstress for the band 
 Pretty eyed pirate smile 
 You married the music man 
 Ballerina you mustve seen her 
 Dancing in the sand 
 And now shes in me always with me 
 Tiny dancer in my hand 
 Jesus freaks out in the street 
 Handing tickets out for God 
 Turning back she just laughs 
 The boulevard aint that bad 
 Piano man he makes his stand 
 In the auditorium 
 Looking on she sings the songs 
 The words she knows the tunes she hums 
 But oh how real it feels 
 Lying here with no one near 
 Only you and you can hear me 
 When I say softly slowly 
 Hold me closer tiny dancer 
 Count the headlights on the highway 
 Lay me down in sheets of linen 
 You had a busy day today 
 Blue jean baby LA lady 
 You had a busy day todayMaybe if I pray every night 
 Youll come back to me 
 Maybe if I cry every day 
 Youll come back to stay 
 Oh maybe 
 Maybe if I hold your hand 
 Ill be at your command 
 And maybe if I kissed your lips 
 Youll be at my command 
 Ive cried and prayed to the Lord 
 To send you back my love 
 But instead you came to me 
 But only in my dreams 
 Maybe if I pray every night 
 And maybe if I cry every day 
 Maybe maybe maybe 
 Maybe 
 Maybe maybe maybeAll I got is a black cross 
 And two crabs in my left eye 
 What you say you want you want 
 Like a lump in your right thigh 
 Were going left on right 
 And I dont want to see you again 
 Going left on right 
 And I dont wanna be your friend 
 You the users of the wheel 
 Stink of oil and electric eels 
 Users of forbidden tools 
 We must be the fools 
 Cancel the world 
 Erase history 
 There is no future 
 As far as I can see 
 And I dont wanna be your friendShe 
 She 
 Lock the bus undo the chain 
 Getting all to hot gotta head on Fifth and Main

 Well Im a millionaire too but not like you 
 As far as Im concerned I got a job to do 
 Ive got to pave the way Ive got to save the day 
 Ive got to make it better Ive got to say 
 You and I were millionaires 
 But were a million miles away from the saint who stares 
 Upon the millions who die every day of the week 
 Just because they cant get enough to eat 
 While we the rich dine on all these feasts 
 And everythings fine yeah peaches and creme 
 But it just isnt something youve got to realize 
 Theres something wrong weve got to open our eyes 
 When the world cries we just cant hide 
 Weve got a job to do weve got to save some lives 
 Were millionaires 
 Hey hey Mr Millionaire 
 Twice as nice when you share 
 A spiritual price Do you care 
 Dice the mice when you share 
 Pave the way take the dare 
 Well Im a millionaire too all I know that is true 
 Is that Ive got more cash than I can use 
 I want anything that I can have 
 But I dont need nothin and I never have 
 Each damn day my hearts set far 
 But Ill be okay cause I dont starve 
 Kids from the street the losing their emotion 
 So damn snobby so out of touch 
 With two hungry people who die as they stare 
 At the city at night you know it gives to share 
 So listen up you millionaires 
 Every woman every man help all you can 
 All races unite and I will now concern 
 To the type of problem that helps us learn 
 Pave the way take the dareHey man 
 Oh leave me alone you know 
 Hey man 
 Oh Henry get off the phone I gotta 
 I gotta straighten my face 
 This mellowthighed chick just put my spine out of place 
 My schooldays insane 
 My works down the drain 
 Well shes a total blamblam 
 She said she had to squeeze it but she and then she 
 Oh dont lean on me man 
 Cause you cant afford the ticket 
 Back from Suffragette City 
 Cause you aint got time to check it 
 You know my Suffragette City 
 Is outta sight 
 Shes all right 
 Oh Henry dont be unkind go away 
 I cant take you this time no way

 Oh shes all right 
 My Suffragette City 
 Ooh oh Suffragette City

 Ah wham bam thank you maam 
 My Suffragette City  Quite alright 
 My Suffragette City  Too fine 
 Oh my Suffragette City 
 SuffragetteDown the street you can hear her scream Youre a disgrace 
 As she slams the door in his drunken face 
 And now he stands outside 
 And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool 
 He cries Oh girl you must be mad 
 What happened to the sweet love you and me had 
 Against the door he leans and starts a scene 
 And his tears fall and burn on the garden green 
 And so castles made of sand 
 Fall in the sea 
 Eventually 
 A little Indian brave who before he was ten 
 Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends 
 And he built a dream that when he grew up 
 He would be a fierce warrior Indian chief 
 Many moons passed fore the dream grew strong 
 Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song 
 And fight his first battle but something went wrong 
 Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
 Melts into the sea 
 There was a young girl whose heart was a frown 
 Because she was crippled for life and she couldnt speak a sound 
 And she wished and prayed she could stop living 
 So she decided to die 
 She drove her wheelchair to the edge of the shore 
 And to her legs she smiled You wont hurt me no more 
 But then a sight shed never seen made her jump and say 
 Look a golden winged ship is passing my way 
 And it really didnt ever stop 
 It just kept on going 
 Slips into the sea 
 EventuallyLet me tell you now 
 When I had you to myself 
 I didnt want you around 
 Those pretty faces always made you 
 Stand out in a crowd 
 But someone picked you from the bunch 
 One glance was all it took 
 Now its much too late for me 
 To take a second look 
 Oh baby give me one more chance 
 To show you that I love you 
 Wont you please let me 
 Back in your heart 
 Oh darling I was blind to let you go 
 Let you go baby 
 But now since I see you in his arms 
 I want you back 
 Yes I do now 
 Ooh ooh baby 
 Na na na na 
 Trying to live without your love 
 Is one long sleepless night 
 Let me show you girl 
 That I know wrong from right 
 Every street you walk on 
 I leave tear stains on the ground 
 Following the girl 
 I didnt even want around 
 Let me tell you now 
 Oh baby all I need is one more chance 
 Oh darlin I was blind to let you go 
 Let you go baby 
 But now since I see you in his arms uh huh 
 A buh buh buh buh 
 All I want 
 All I need 
 Oh just one more chance 
 To show you that I love you 
 Baby baby baby baby baby baby 
 Forget what happened then 
 And let me live again 
 Oh baby I was blind to let you go 
 Spare me of this cause 
 Gimme back what I lost 
 Oh baby I need one more chance ha 
 I tell ya that I love you 
 Baby ow baby baby 
 I want you back 
 I want you backWoke up this morning like I always do 
 I still like to think that Im new 
 Time just gets its way 
 Strawberries left to decay 
 Cant find my pants or my bank account 
 Dont you slip away 
 Voices that start to betray 
 Even though you raised me I will never be your father 
 King of each and every Sunset Marquis 
 Even though youre crazy you will never be a bother 
 Youre my Old Man In the Sea 
 I still like to laugh when I make a joke 
 I still like to think that theres hope 
 Time just has its say 
 Struck by the sight of an empty hall 
 Dont you fade away 
 Youre my Old Man in the Sea 
 The hunter gets hunted 
 We all get confronted 
 Dont just slip away 
 Youre my Old Man In the SeaComing on to the light of day 
 We got many moons that are deep at play 
 So I keep an eye on the shadow smile 
 To see what it has to say 
 You and I both know 
 Everything must go away 
 What do you say 
 Spinning knot that is on my heart 
 Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark 
 You got sneak attack from the zodiac 
 But I see your fire spark 
 Eat the breeze and go 
 Blow by blow and go away 
 What do you say Yeah 
 You dont know my mind 
 You dont know my kind 
 Dark necessities are part of my design 
 Tell the world that Im 
 Falling from the sky 
 Stumble down to the parking lot 
 You got no time for the afterthought 
 Theyre like ice cream for an astronaut 
 Well thats me looking for we 
 Turn the corner and 
 Find the world at your command 
 Playing the hand 
 Do you want this love of mine 
 Darkness helps us all to shine 
 Do you want it do you want it now 
 Do you want it all the time 
 But darkness helps us all to shine 
 Pick you up like a paperback 
 With the track record of a maniac 
 So I move it in and we unpack 
 Its the same as yesterday 
 Any way we roll 
 Falling from the sky and 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh ohEverything inside of me 
 Is burning up for you to see 
 And if we should get into it 
 A twoway kind of syndicate hold me 
 Compare us to a ferris wheel 
 Just be sure of what you want to steal 
 Some people do it by the book 
 But I prefer to go by feel tell me 
 I wanted to get outta here 
 But every time I reappear 
 And know I have the words my dear 
 To whisper right into your ear hey yeah 
 Cmon girl 
 Lets get it right 
 The spirit of a dragons tear 
 Is lovely at this time of year 
 The cave within your mountainside 
 Is deeper than it will be wide hold me 
 My disenchanted diplomat 
 Asleep inside the laundromat 
 Conveyor belts are moving 
 And I want you to be sure of that tell me 
 And if you let it germinate 
 I know it will be worth the wait 
 Disputed by the news that it was you 
 Who tried to instigate hey yeah 
 Blessed are the hypocrites 
 Outwitted but she never quits 
 The trouble with a band of slits 
 Is washing off the muddy bits hey yeah 
 Oh yeah shes with me and Im your man 
 If I cant find you no one canA long long long long time ago 
 Before the wind before the snow 
 Lived a man lived a man I know 
 Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho 
 Sir Psycho Sexy that is me 
 Sometimes I find I need to scream ah 
 Hes a freak of nature but we love him so 
 Hes a freak of nature but we let him go 
 Deep inside the Garden of Eden 
 Standing there with my hardon bleeding 
 Theres a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen 
 Good God no that would be treason 
 Believe me Eve she gave me good reason 
 Booty looking too good not to be squeezing 
 Creamy beaver hotter than a fever 
 Im a giving cause shes the receiver 
 I wont and I dont hang up until I please her 
 Making her feel like an overachiever 
 I take it away for a minute just to tease her 
 Then I give it back a little bit deeper 
 Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yeah 
 Hes the man that I met one time 
 Hes the man that left me blind 
 Hes the man hes the man hes the man 
 Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yeah yeah 
 I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile 
 She said get out and spread your legs 
 And then she tried to cop a feel 
 That cop she was all dressed in blue 
 Was she pretty Boy Im telling you 
 She stuck my butt with her big black stick 
 I said whats up now suck my dick 
 Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb 
 She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand 
 On her crotch so very warm 
 I could feel her getting wet through her uniform 
 Propping her up on the black and white 
 Unzipped and slipped Ooh thats tight 
 I swatted her like no SWAT team can 
 Turned a cherry pie right into jam

 In your arms in your legs in your pussy Id kill 
 To be with you 
 To kiss with you

 Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down 
 Descending waves of graceful pleasure 
 For your love there is no measure 
 Her curves they bend with subtle splendor 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the funk will make me freak 
 If I should die before I waked 
 Allow me Lord to rock out naked 
 Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip 
 Calling up a little girl with a bull whip 
 Licketysplit go snapsnap 
 Girl getting off all in my lap 
 The tallest tree the sweetest sap 
 Blowing my ass right off the map 
 Ooh and its nice out here

 New Jerseys guns get ready to shoot 
 Take a walk down the firing room 
 Fire one its shakedown cruise

 Cheer the change to make the news 
 Send the shell down the spiral groove 
 Bombs away its a shakedown cruise yeah 
 Battle ship battle shipHoo Lord

 Through the Hollywood hills 
 The farther west the farther out

 Well I dig the dirt an I dig the dust

 Ridin wild on a paisley dragon 
 Through the Hollywood hills yeah 
 Huh Hollywood hills

 Passion dripping from the coyotes eyes 
 He can taste his blood

 Intimate sight has come in to lightBells around St Petersburg 
 When I saw you 
 I hope I get what you deserve 
 And this is where I find 
 Smoke surrounds your perfect face 
 And Im falling 
 Pushing a broom out into space 
 And this is where I found a way 
 The stadium arcadium 
 A mirror to the moon mirror to the moon 
 Well Im forming and Im warming to you 
 State of the art until the clouds come crashing 
 Stranger things have happened both 
 Before and after noon before and after noon 
 Pushing myself and no I dont mind asking now 
 Alone inside in my forest room 
 And its storming 
 I never thought Id be in bloom 
 But this is where I start 
 Derelict days and the stereo plays 
 For the all night crowd that it cannot phase 
 And Im calling 
 Tedious weeds that the media breeds 
 But the animal gets what the animal needs 
 And Im sorry 
 And Im forming and Im warming to you 
 Rays of dust that wrap around 
 Your Citizen 
 Kind enough to disavow 
 This is where I stand 
 A state of the art until the clouds come crashing 
 Im pushing myself and no I dont mind asking 
 And Im forming and Im warming to youDeep inside the soul hole 
 Of Mother Earth 
 Father Time came 
 With a supersonic supersonic burst 
 His soul monkey sperm tribes 
 Racing to be first 
 Her ruby fruit jungle 
 Givin bush baby bush baby birth 
 The baby was a boy 
 But I think what stunned her 
 Is that this bare breasted baby 
 Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder 
 Crackin from his thumb bone 
 Came thelonious thunder 
 Fill the sky with hellfire 
 From way down down down under 
 I am a jungle man 
 I get all the bush I can 
 Erupting from the ground 
 In Hollywood he glowed 
 His jungle turned to concrete 
 His funk bone bone bone bone to stone 
 Like a full blown volcano 
 I must let it be known 
 That through this boys vein 
 Atomic lava blood flows and flows 
 His soul shocking sounds 
 They make the mountains moan 
 This boys become a man 
 Its time to take take take 
 Take the throne 
 I get all the bush I canIve got a bad disease 
 Up from my brain is where I bleed 
 Insanity it seems 
 Has got me by my soul to squeeze 
 Well all the love from thee 
 With all the dying trees I scream 
 The angels in my dreams yeah 
 Have turned to demons of greed thats me 
 Where I go I just dont know 
 I got to got to gotta take it slow 
 When I find my peace of mind 
 Im gonna give you some of my good time 
 Today love smiled on me 
 It took away my pain say please 
 Aw let your ride be free 
 You gotta let it be oh yeah 
 I got to gotta gotta take it slow 
 Oh so polite indeed 
 Well Ive got everything I need 
 Oh make my days a breeze 
 And take away my selfdestruction 
 Its bitter baby and its very sweet 
 A holy rollercoaster but Im on my feet 
 Take me to the river let me on your shore 
 Well Ill be coming back baby Ill be coming back for more 
 Doodoodoodoo dingle zingadong bone 
 Badi bada bazumba crungacong gone bad 
 I could not forget but I will not endeavor 
 Simple pleasures are much better but I wont regret it never 
 I might end up somewhere in Mexico 
 Im gonna keep you for the end of timePlease dont ask me who 
 Oh who you think I am 
 I could live without that 
 Im just a modest man 
 Meet at the corner and oh 
 Tell me what to do 
 Cause Im messed up on you 
 And had I known all that I do now 
 Im guessing were through now 
 Receding into the forest 
 I will lay around and wait and Ill wait for you 
 Please dont ask me where 
 Oh where you think Ive been 
 Ive been a lot of places 
 But this could be my win 
 Im guessing were through now 
 I feel so bad I thought youd wanna know 
 Something I wanna show 
 I thought youd wanna know 
 Please dont say you want 
 To keep in touch out there 
 To see you on the corner 
 Well that I just cant bear 
 Meet me at the corner and oh 
 I will lay around and wait 
 Hey and I turn 
 I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods 
 A sign from the gods that you werent meant to be mine 
 And its fine 
 Taking it all for a ride 
 Till the day when its gone 
 Mystified by where it all went wrong 
 When its gone 
 I live and I learn 
 And I lose and I win 
 But its better than ever whenever Im in 
 Thank you girl for everywhere that Ive beenSomething inside the cards I know is right 
 Dont wanna live somebody elses life 
 This is what I want to be 
 And this is what I give to you because I get it free 
 She smiles while I do my time 
 I could die for you 
 Oh this life I choose 
 Im here to be your only gobetween 
 To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen 
 What I really want to do is turn it into motion beauty that I cant abuse 
 You know that I use my senses to 
 You can see that its only everywhere 
 Id take it all and then Id find a way to share 
 Come along and go alone with me 
 Wander with me yo its all for free 
 What you wanna do 
 Come again and tell me where you wanna go 
 What it means for me to be with you alone 
 Close the door and no one has to know 
 How we are 
 Oh this life I chooseHistorys so strong 
 Historys so strong 
 Sing another drinking song 
 The honkytonk will do 
 Make another breaking bong 
 Your favorite ingenue 
 This the distant dawn 
 I put my cards upon the table 
 I do to speak as I am able 
 One pixies brokendown devotion 
 I threw my pistol in the ocean 
 Eyes wide with revelation 
 Shine at the police station 
 And when the burden comes round 
 Im sure that you will go down 
 Stay all night we save the population 
 This the land its pawn 
 Sailing through the Lexicon 
 A pistol and its hot 
 Blood and border lines withdrawn 
 Take another bottle down the block 
 To land the shrew 
 Make another awful sound 
 To ride the gothic through 
 Stay all night we save the populationShow me a sign that I love you 
 Blow me a mind as you always do 
 Remind me to tell you that Ive come to 
 Believe in the beauty the power of you 
 Woman dissolve into the sea 
 The body of water is calling me 
 The god of my daughter is always free 
 Theres nothing to solve and youre solving me 
 Ooh Im in your company 
 Ooh body thats calling me 
 Throw me a line I could use one 
 I specialdesign me cause Im your son 
 Two thousand below where I feel my love 
 The body of water where I come from 
 Im dreaming got a reason to steal 
 Fire from the other side out there 
 Formations flow like screams 
 Im made with a life to spare 
 Get the jizz Mister sism got a rhythm 
 Technology of a prayer 
 Scientist to the prism of faith 
 And hope so I am there 
 Baby Im old can you come here 
 The science of love is becoming clear 
 Invisible love with the color still 
 I need to a place in the atmosphere 
 And I may believeI saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say 
 Your eyes had wandered off to something distant cold and grey 
 I guess you didnt see it coming 
 Someones gotten used to slumming 
 Dreaming of the golden years 
 I see you had to change careers 
 Far away but we both know its somewhere 
 I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday 
 The driftwood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pay 
 I know you from another picture 
 Someone with the most conviction 
 We used to read the funny papers 
 Fooled around and pulled some capers 
 Not today I send a message to her 
 A message that Im coming coming to pursue her 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I got you ten times over Ill chase you down til youre dead 
 I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray 
 An empty shell of loveliness now dusted with decay 
 What happened to the funny paper 
 Smiling was your money maker 
 Someone oughta situate her 
 Find a way to educate her 
 All the way time to come and find you 
 You cant hide from me girl so never mind what I do 
 I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head 
 I saw you in the churchyard there was no time to exchange 
 You were getting married and it felt so very strange 
 I guess I didnt see it coming 
 Now I guess its me whos bumming 
 You and I were mixing tears 
 Not today not for me but someone 
 Never could get used to so now I will refuse to 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I got my best foot forward and Ill chase you down til youre deadNever too soon to be through 
 Too much for me and too much for you 
 Youre gonna loose in time 
 Every turn looking to burn 
 Some never learn live and learn 
 Stop searching for a curse 
 Before you end up in a hearse 
 That you hurt inside inside 
 Pains part of life dont hide behind your false pride 
 Dont slip away and dont forget 
 Ill give you more than you can get 
 Too late to tell you how I feel 
 I want you back but I get real 
 Can you hear my falling tears 
 Making rain where you lay 
 Can end up being such a bore 
 Its so lonely when you dont even know yourselfThis is my time this is my tear 
 I can see clearly now that this is not a place for playing solitaire 
 Tell me where you want me 
 This is my time this is my tear 
 Coming on strong Baudelaire 
 Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare 
 Let it rise before you 
 This is my crime 
 All in all and Im loving every rise and fall 
 The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this 
 In the end and then all will be forgiven 
 When surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give 
 Say it now because you never know 
 Devil may cry devil may care 
 Distillers got a scream and now I know just why when shes moving air 
 Can you feel the voltage 
 This is my time 
 California skies got room to spare 
 Oh never know 
 Take it outside take it out there 
 In the final moment 
 Oh never knowDeath 
 Let me catch my breath 
 Let me see whats left 
 Let me see whats true 
 Do I really want to 
 Run from my depths 
 Will I have regrets 
 Will I ever find you 
 Will I ever find words 
 That give me motive to express 
 Bread 
 Will I go unfed 
 Will I be that who rushes on in 
 To where angels fear to tread 
 Was it me who bled 
 On the new death bed 
 And there is no fear 
 When youre leaning on love 
 Those grateful dead 
 Someone like you 
 To research the meaning of love 
 Someone I do 
 To be there when push comes to shove 
 I know that you know 
 The ending the must 
 Chess let me play my best 
 When I do regress let it all unwind 
 Cause were never confined 
 To the board unless 
 Less I second guess 
 Look into the sky where we all comply 
 With something higher than the 
 Rest of my love sail through 
 Sky all around 
 Fell to the ground 
 Now Im a child 
 Stayed for a while 
 Flesh  is it meaningless 
 But we all protest 
 To the last request 
 Is there anything you 
 Could now suggest 
 Did I do my best 
 Did I leave it better 
 Even though we look to be 
 Just mildly obsessed with you 
 Sail through 
 To be thereIf I stall at all or 
 Hesitate 
 The world of always 
 Never seems to wait 
 A comedy that could be 
 So divine 
 Never Is A Long Time 
 A shadow born 
 To steal the light of day 
 You woke me up 
 And said cmon lets play 
 Well now I know 
 That never has its way 
 You are you are 
 The star I say 
 From far from far 
 From far away 
 The laws that cause 
 It all to stay 
 By you by you 
 For you I do 
 I thought Id done it all 
 I thought I knew 
 But nothing ever looked 
 As good as you 
 Now every never 
 That I knew was fine 
 Never is a long time 
 And now I share 
 This feeling with my dad 
 Stolen goods arent always 
 Half that bad 
 The never that well always 
 The faded piping on your press 
 Will always have its place I guess 
 A common love 
 That we can bless 
 The pleasure of 
 My childs mess 
 Golden books 
 And tenderness 
 Have rescued me 
 From emptiness 
 It all it all it all 
 It all it all it all to stayAnd if I had a clue 
 Id know exactly what do to 
 If I were the wiser of the two 
 And if I saw it all so clear 
 Id write it down and bend your ear 
 If I were the clearer of the two 
 We can take a walk 
 Into the canyons of 5th Avenue 
 Sing and dance just to name a few 
 All I do 
 And if I heard the angels sing 
 Id sing it back to you and bring 
 Sound of heaven ringing just for you 
 And if I saw the sun fall down 
 Id pick it up and make a crown 
 One that was a perfect fit for you 
 Into the apple orchard by the school 
 We could make a little residue 
 We can find a place to stay 
 A secret little hideaway 
 Spend a little time inside of you 
 All eyes 
 All eyes on you hey 
 All I do hey 
 All I doIve got myself 
 In a masochistic hold 
 Why dont you let go 
 Shake it off 
 Just to redirect my flow 
 Come on lets go 
 Sit up straight 
 Im on a double date 
 Ive got to find my way 
 Into the light heavy middle weight 
 We dont stop rock around the clock 
 Motor mouthing off 
 In front of every other road block 
 Come again and tell me 
 What youre going through 
 Like a girl who only knew 
 Her child was due 
 Memories of everything 
 Of lemon trees on mercury 
 Come to me with remedies 
 From five or six of seven seas 
 You always took me with a smile 
 When I was down 
 That blew through 
 Looking up into 
 A reverse vertigo 
 What an undertow 
 Give it up 
 Another stubborn scorpio 
 Come on lets go 
 To the moon she gave 
 Another good review 
 Turn around and look at me 
 Its really really you 
 That blew throughDeep inside of a parallel 
 Universe 
 Its getting harder and harder 
 To tell what came first 
 Under water where thoughts can breathe 
 Easily 
 Far away you were made in a sea 
 Just like me 
 Christ Im a sidewinder Im a 
 California king 
 I swear its everywhere 
 Its everything 
 Staring straight up into the sky 
 Oh my my 
 A solar system that fits in your eye 
 Microcosm 
 You could die but youre never dead 
 Spider web 
 Take a look at the stars in your head 
 Fields of space kid 
 Psychic changes are born in your heart 
 Entertain 
 A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same 
 Bless your heart girl 
 Kill the pressure its raining on 
 Salty Cheeks 
 When you hear the beloved song 
 I am with you 
 Its everythingIts always half and half 
 Im happy and Im sad 
 Everything thats beautiful 
 Always kills me too 
 The highest I get up 
 Is the deepest I get down 
 Youre up there with your life 
 Thats why I gotta shout shout 
 And then gotta shout shout 
 Blues for Meister 
 You sweet little thing 
 Im so sad I gotta sing 
 A cozy little kitty up 
 Sittin on the couch 
 Oh kitty cat oh baby 
 I really miss you now 
 Well have some respect 
 For my cat 
 He got squashed by the wheel 
 Of a Cadillac 
 Well me and my pussy 
 We lost our flow 
 Well goodbye my little calico 
 Your foods still in the cupboard 
 Hangin in its can 
 You used to love to eat it 
 Down 
 Ill always love you Meister 
 You were so good to me 
 Theres nothing like you nowhere 
 As far as I can seeNot another motherfucking 
 Politician 
 Doin nothin but something for his own ambition 
 HuhEverybody knows about Hollywood skunks 
 Soulful sex and funky monks 
 My tinsel town is made of steel 
 Lets whimp lets shout lets make a deal 
 Hollywood or Hollywood not 
 We are so lively on the spot 
 Feel so alive dont know where to stop 
 Are you deaf or dumb or what 
 Silly little creature Sikamikanico 
 Sittin on a bleacher Sikamikanico 
 I dont want a teacher Sikamikanico 
 If were gonna reach ya Sikamikanico 
 Dont you know bout Frank Sinatra 
 Thats all gone because I got up 
 We dont just play we display 
 Gotta give it up gotta do it my way 
 Shootin my sex up to the cave 
 You might receive my radio wave 
 Shake it girl you wont get hurt 
 I knock my dick into the dirt 
 Anybody want some Sikamikanico 
 Everybody on the run Sikamikanico 
 Rock it more breeza Sikamikanico 
 If were gonna treasure Sikamikanico

 Hey Joe a radio chump 
 Ill never gonna overcome in Hollywood Ill come alone 
 Oh no it would now leave my nose that you blow 
 Hey ho lets go 
 So big boy say you want bad news

 If you dont like it time to move 
 And all the press you dont amaze me 
 Im not your dick so dont appraise me 
 Never gonna fit your critical shit 
 You better watch out you might get hit 
 If were gonna treasure SikamikanicoDrivin up the coast 
 To find a version of the truth 
 Left the backdoor swinging 
 Like a dirty little sleuth 
 The truth is I have never left 
 Felt half this alive 
 Now its time to dance 
 Upon the grave called fortyfive 
 Jacked up on some Kerouac 
 And surely bulletproof 
 The girl who taught me what to do 
 Was missing her front tooth 
 Gentle as a storm 
 Inside your mental health 
 I want to find the answer 
 But I just cant find myself 
 I say so long 
 To the way I played 
 The way I played 
 Inside of yesterday 
 Hey lets run around 
 The great escape 
 From out of my hometown 
 Later I would look for love 
 Inside a womans dorm 
 A couch to keep me humble 
 And her breath to keep me warm 
 Ophelia was the girl 
 That I was feeling for 
 Come to realize 
 It was me who was the whore 
 A captain lost himself 
 Inside a forty year old skull 
 The drink of choice was knowledge 
 And we always wanted more 
 Drunken sailors 
 Seeking their Geronimo 
 Instead they found the things 
 That they really didnt want to know 
 Country roads 
 Would never let me stay 
 A devils growl and cats meow 
 Were blended into one 
 Termites called suburbanites 
 Were eating all the fun 
 A juggernaut of comedy 
 And blasphemy 
 I wanna stop the madness 
 But I think it has to be 
 From out of my hometownWere all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way 
 Along with six million others in this place called LA 
 LA is the place sets my mind ablaze 
 For me its a race through a cotton pickin maze 
 The town makes me jump its got a bunch of bad chicks 
 Well sure its got some chumps but I still get my kicks 
 My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick 
 Like a come on a thumb 
 Poppin hump hump hump pop out 
 The action never stops Im as wild as can be 
 Cause Im shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea 
 Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop 
 But he never met the Tree so he never bebopped out hop 
 Antwan the Swan from the pretty fish pond 
 Was a bad mother jumper you could tell he was strong 
 He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat 
 And between his legs was a sweat young lass 
 He threw a hundred women up against the wall 
 And he swore to fear that hed love em all 
 By the time he got to ninety nine he had to stop 
 Because thats when he thought that he heard a phone 
 Last night and the night before I heard a 
 Fop outside then I came in doors 
 Freak out 
 Now that I told you a little something about the Flea 
 A little something about the Tree a little something about me 
 I cant leave you hangin but my man Shermzy he swings the yang he bangs the 
 Yang 
 And now its time to hear him do his playin you better be burning Sherman 
 Were all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way 
 Step outWhoo 
 Stiff club 
 Its my nature 
 Custom love 
 Is the nomenclature 
 Turn down 
 Mass confusion 
 Hit the road cause we just keep cruising 
 Double my fun 
 Double my vision 
 Long hard look at my last decision 
 Hustle here 
 Hustle there 
 Hustle me bitch and you best beware 
 Its emotional 
 And I told you so 
 But you had to know 
 So I told you 
 Soft walk 
 To horizon 
 One big crash that no one dies in 
 This is for the folks in Fayetteville 
 Itll come true if you say it will 
 Look around look around look around 
 All around all around all around 
 Please dont 
 Look right through me 
 It hurts my heart 
 When you do that to me 
 Street life 
 Out my window 
 City may breeze gonna stroke my skin though 
 Just a lot of words 
 On an old brick wall 
 Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree straw 
 Put my peg 
 Into your square 
 Run around like we just dont care 
 All around oh yeah 
 Move it I gotta get ya wanna getcha 
 When Im feeling small and Im hitting a wall 
 Wanna feel it all around 
 Wanna feel it all aroundGettin born in the state of Mississippi 
 Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie 
 In Alabama she would swing a hammer 
 Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama 
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor 
 What in the world does your company take me for 
 Black bandanna sweet Louisiana 
 Robbin on a bank in the state of Indiana 
 Shes a runner rebel and a stunner 
 On her merry way sayin Baby whatcha gonna 
 Looking down the barrel of a hot metal fortyfive 
 Just another way to survive 
 California rest in peace 
 Simultaneous release 
 California show your teeth 
 Shes my priestess Im your priest 
 Yeah yeah 
 Shes a lover baby and a fighter 
 Shoulda seen it comin when it got a little brighter 
 With a name like Dani California 
 Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya 
 A little loaded she was stealin another breath 
 I love my baby to death 
 Who knew the other side of you 
 Who knew what others died to prove 
 Too true to say goodbye to you 
 Too true to say say say 
 Push the fader gifted animator 
 One for the now and eleven for the later 
 Never made it up to Minnesota 
 North Dakota man was agunnin for the quota 
 Down in the Badlands she was savin the best for last 
 It only hurts when I laugh 
 Gone too fast 
 Yeah yeahShiver for me girl 
 Deliver for me my darling 
 Pushing up to you 
 A river that runs right through you 
 Swim for your smile in a blue rock quarry 
 Make it for me baby you wont be sorry 
 Shiver for me now 
 Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam 
 Settle for love youre never far from home 
 Carry me down into the waters of 
 Carry me down into the water of love 
 Two of us were made of angel dust 
 Ive been around but not around enough 
 Shadow my free form 
 A woman that I could keep warm 
 Quiver for me girl 
 Give me your head and shoulders 
 Shot from the pages of love and glory 
 Sleeping next to you and Im in your story 
 Lets go I know Ill make it for two 
 And then intuitions only what you take from it 
 I know Ill make it for two 
 And then you were there and I was fortunate 
 And then a messy bed apology that I will fall for you yeah 
 Ill make it for two Ill make it for two and 
 A living that I could 
 Be given to you my sweet love 
 Sleeping next to you and Im in your dream 
 Settle for love 
 Settle for loveBehold I am Funkadelic 
 I am not of your world 
 But fear me not 
 I will do you no harm 
 Loan me your funky mind and I shall play with it 
 For nothing is good unless you play with it 
 And all that is good is nasty

 Cause Im so afraid

 For nobody but you

 Im betting that when we collide 
 The universe will shift into a low 
 The travesties that we have seen

 Automatic laughter from a pro 
 My what a good day for a walk outside 
 Id like to get to know you a little better baby 
 God knows that I really tried 
 My what a good day for a take out bride

 Python power straight from Monty 
 Celluloid love got a John Frusciante 
 Spread your head and spread the blanket 
 Shes too free Im the patient 
 Black and white red and blue 
 Things that look good on you 
 And if I scream dont let me go 
 A purple stain  I know 
 Knock on wood we all stay good 
 Cause we all live in Hollywood 
 With Dracula and Darla Hood 
 Unspoken words were understood 
 Up to my ass in alligators 
 Lets get it on with alligator haters 
 Did what you did  did what you said 
 Whats the point yo whats the spread 
 And if I call for you to stay 
 Come hit the funk on your way 
 Its the way out there but I dont care 
 Cause this is where I go 
 Its way out there 
 But I dont care 
 Cause this is what 
 I want to wear 
 To finger paint is not a sin 
 Feather light but you cant move this 
 Farley is and angel and I can prove this 
 Purple is the stain upon my pillow 
 Lets sleep weeping willow 
 Its way out there but I dont care 
 Cause this is where  I go 
 Cause we all live in HollywoodSay goodbye to Oz and everything you own 
 California dreamin is a Pettibon 
 LAs screaming youre my home 
 Vanity is blasted but its rarely fair 
 I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair 
 Got a lot of friends but is anyone there 
 I dont know but its been said 
 Your heart is stronger than your head 
 And this location is my home 
 Stick and move youre living in a quick world 
 Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl 
 Born into it thats for sure 
 Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected 
 Well sick love comes to wash us away 
 Prisons of perspective how your vision gets corrected 
 And sick love is my modern cliché 
 People talk and tell you what you want to hear 
 Do you really need another souvenir 
 Superheroes tend to disappear 
 Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass 
 Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast 
 Chase your tail my baby itll be your last 
 Openly defective is the lover you elected 
 And a portrait she was bound to portrayThey say in chess youve got to kill the queen and then you made it 
 Oh I do you 
 A funny thing the king who gets himself assassinated 
 Hey now every time I lose altitude 
 You took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated 
 Now put away your welcome soon youll find youve over stayed it 
 So divine hell of an elevator 
 All the while my fortune faded 
 Never mind the consequences of the crime 
 This time my fortunes faded 
 The medicated state of mind youve found is overrated 
 You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it 
 Come on God do I seem bullet proof 
 This time my fortunes fadedOoh 
 Fallin free fallin free 
 Fallin free 
 Ooh 
 You and me you and me 
 You and me 
 I feel love I feel love 
 I feel love 
 I feel love I feel love I feel love 
 OohThirty dirty birds 
 Sitting on a curb 
 Chirping and Burping 
 And eating 
 Dirty earthworms 
 Along comes Herbie 
 From thirtythird 
 And third 
 Saw the thirty 
 Dirty birds 
 Boy he was 
 DisturbedHow strong is my love Oh 
 How strong is my love Oh 
 How wrong could it be 
 Ill walk a water mile 
 Rest a while to kiss your smile 
 Laugh and roll and after a while 
 Ill begin to like your style 
 She turned me down this time she 
 She turned me down 
 Lord I cant believe she 
 She turned me inside out 
 All I ask of you 
 Is turn me up this time 
 Come on over show me your 
 Your glow soul I do adore 
 Ill be sure to drop my guard 
 Give it up its not that hard 
 She turned me inside out she 
 Tested life but thats all right 
 Darker than the darkest night 
 Living hell and pollocks at you 
 Getting new down your back 
 How wrong could it beMy friends are so depressed 
 I feel the question of your loneliness 
 Confide cause Ill be on your side 
 You know I will 
 Exgirlfriend called me up 
 Alone and desperate on the prison phone 
 They want to give her seven years 
 For being sad 
 I love all of you 
 Hurt by the cold 
 So hard and lonely too 
 When you dont know yourself 
 My friends are so distressed 
 And standing on the brink of emptiness 
 No words I know of to express 
 This emptiness 
 Imagine me 
 Taught by tragedy 
 Release 
 Is peace 
 I heard a little girl 
 And what she said was something beautiful 
 To give your love no matter what 
 Is what she said 
 When you dont know yourselfLeaving town to find the flower that I could deserve 
 Someone moves someones bound to get their feelings hurt 
 Im loving you youre out of range 
 I wanted you youre out of range 
 As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill 
 I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil 
 Wanted to youre out of range 
 I dont want to much more than 
 Than to be reborn in the morning 
 Reborn so I can feel ya 
 The thorns are blooming with ya 
 I feel ya 
 I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times 
 Barely there your voice is cracking up across state lines 
 Loving you youre out of range 
 Wanted you youre out of range 
 Skies of ecstasy were breaking up 
 While I do believe the tears of God were 
 Falling down upon my swollen cheeks 
 I know it hurts when its taken away 
 I tell you that I could be living 
 Today with you or without you ok 
 Lost by the rain and its all gonna change 
 No sir not to much more than 
 Than to be 
 Reborn in the morning 
 I feel yaIt started when we were little kids 
 Free spirits but already tormented 
 By our own hands given to us by our parents 
 We got together and wrote on desks 
 And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
 And slipped through whatever cracks 
 We can find minds altered 
 We didnt falter in portraying hysterical 
 And tragic characters 
 In a smog filled universe 
 We loved the dirty city 
 And the journeys away 
 From it we had not yet been 
 Or seen our friends selves 
 Chase tails round and round in 
 A downward spiral leaving a trail 
 Of irretrievable vital life juice 
 Behind still the brothers blood 
 Comrades partner family 
 Cuzz was impenetrable 
 And we lived inside it laughing 
 With no clothes and everything 
 Experimental till death was upon us 
 In our face mortality 
 And lots of things seemed futile 
 Then but love and music can save us 
 And did while the giant grey monster grew 
 More poisoned and volatile around us 
 And jaws clamping down 
 And spewing ugly shit around 
 Nothing is the same so we keep moving 
 We keep moving 
 Went off and off and got some hair cuts 
 Lookin wild and got all drugged up 
 Hopped a train into the night 
 Got a ride with a transvestite 
 Two boys in San Francisco 
 Blasted off in a Bart bathroom 
 Those coppers woke us up 
 Mothersfuckers woke us up 
 Two young brothers on a hover craft 
 Telepathetic love and bellylaughs 
 Storm the stage of Universal 
 Slim shine talk boy go subversal 
 Papas proud and so he sent us 
 Pounding hearts full and relentless 
 Two boys in London England 
 Climbing out of hostel windows 
 Wearing gear so out but in though 
 Come on kind and do the no no 
 Two young brothers on a hovercraft 
 Telepathics love and belly laughs 
 We went to Fairfax High School 
 Jumped off buildings into their pools 
 Wed sit down and grease at Canters 
 Run like hell they cant catch us 
 Two boys in LA proper 
 Stealin anything that we could 
 Gotta sneak into the Starwood 
 Gotta peak into the deep good 
 I remember ten years ago 
 In Hollywood we did some good 
 And we did some real bad stuff 
 But the Butthole Surfers 
 Always said its better to regret 
 Something you did than something you didnt do 
 We were young and we were looking looking for the deep kick 
 Seen em come seen em goThrow me all around like a boomerang sky 
 Whatever you do dont tell me why 
 Poppies grow tall then say byebye 
 The wave is here 
 A seamless little team and then we tanked 
 I guess were not so sacrosanct 
 The tip of my tongue but then we blanked 
 Waiting on the wind to tell my side 
 Ready set jet but she never gets far 
 Listen to your skin from the seat of my car 
 Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar 
 The longest wave 
 Whatcha want 
 Whatcha need 
 Do you love 
 Maybe Im the right one 
 Maybe Im the wrong 
 Just another play the pirate and the papillon 
 Time to call it a day 
 Maybe youre my last love 
 Maybe youre my first 
 Just another way to play inside the universe 
 Now I know why we came 
 Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gage 
 Under my skin and half my age 
 Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage 
 Waiting on the wind to turn my page 
 Steady your sails for the butterfly flap 
 Whatever you do dont close that gap 
 Im dreaming of a woman but shes just my nap 
 Your ship is in 
 Waiting on the tide so I can swim 
 Now I knowWhy dont you love me like you used to do 
 How come you treat me like a worn out shoe 
 My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue 
 So why dont you love me like you used to do 
 Why dont you spot me like you used to do 
 When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do 
 Im the same old trouble that youve always been through 
 Why dont you be the way you used to be 
 How come you fight so many fights with me 
 Somebody changed so lemme give you a clue 
 Why dont you love me like you used to do 
 Why dont you say the things you used to say 
 How come you treat me like a piece of clay 
 You cant keep a lovin and a huggin and a kissin and I dont know why 
 We dont get near or further closer land of country mouths 
 I dont love like a huggin and a kissin and I dont know why 
 Take the ball 
 We dont get near or further closer land of country mouthsI should be on my way 
 I really ought not stay 
 Far to strong with the pinnup on 
 Hear my conscience Im gone 
 I should have let you know 
 This boy was made to roam 
 The band is who Im married to 
 And this is what god said to do 
 I let my motor stray 
 Forgive me where I play 
 Sendin my love to a Tennessee 
 She got style now lets see 
 I remember who 
 To surrender to 
 The captain of my ship is brave 
 Its brothers hood on a mothers day 
 Do do do dit do 
 Aw sure enough I love you 
 Aw sure enough I do 
 So just remember who you 
 Who you surrender to 
 Im off to wonderland 
 Just in my second hand 
 Life is short but aint it grand 
 Im a way outside but in demand 
 Ill take it on my chin 
 Go back and forth again 
 Find me on some telephone 
 With a broken down voice and a shakeed tone 
 Do unto others who 
 You would have do to you 
 Aint no way Id ever trade 
 That sparer life for this piece of shade 
 Destined for battle zone 
 Whys there no lesson known 
 The lessons not to wait for me 
 Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet 
 Let your joy decide 
 Let your joy divide 
 Everything we do 
 Let your motor ride 
 Ow help me 
 We could have made it my love 
 We could have skated through

 When its killing me what do I really need 
 Come back and hey oh 
 Look at what I say oh 
 The more I see the less I know 
 The more I like to let it go 
 Hey oh woah 
 Deep beneath the cover 
 Of another perfect wonder 
 Where its so white as snow 
 Privately divided 
 By a world so undecided 
 And theres nowhere to go 
 In between the cover 
 And its so white as snow 
 Running through the field 
 Where all my tracks will be concealed 
 When to descend to amend for a friend 
 All the channels that have broken down 
 Now you bring it up Im gonna ring it up 
 Just to hear you sing it out 
 And I do believe what we rely on 
 The more I see the less I know 
 I said hey hey yeah 
 Oh yeah tell my love now 
 Hey hey yeah 
 I said hey oh yeah 
 Hey yeah yeah oh yeahIf I die before I get it done will you decide 
 Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive 
 Because a long time ago I knew not to deprive 
 Its safe out there and now youre everywhere just like the skies 
 You are love you are the love supreme you are the rise 
 And when you hear this you know its your jam its your goodbye 
 Like I said you know Im almost dead you know Im almost gone 
 And when the drummer drums hes gonna play my song to carry me along 
 And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong 
 We all crossed when we were feeling lost its just the tide 
 Katari cried the day her lover died she recognized 
 Because he gave her a life of real love its no surprise 
 The nights are long but the years are short when youre alive 
 Way back when would never be again it was a time 
 Its gonna catch you so glad I met you to walk the line 
 And when the drummer drums hes gonna play my song to carry me along 
 Come get me 
 Hey Hey 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah

 So when its time to die 
 Even the reaper cries 
 Let me die 
 So when its time to leave

 Crosstown traffic So hard to get through to you 
 Crosstown traffic I dont need to run over you 
 Crosstown traffic All you do is slow me down

 Move over heh 
 YeahAbout this planet there is something I know 
 Theres a very big difference between above and below 
 A friend foe or bro leave your body on the floor 
 Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow 
 Here above land man has laid his plan 
 And yes it does include the Ku Klux Klan 
 We got a government so twisted and bent 
 Bombs tanks and guns is how our money is spent 
 We got VD heroin greed and prostitution 
 Tension aggravation L Ron Hubbard solution 
 Not to mention hardcore chemical pollution 
 If you think youre just away youre in a mental institution 
 And thats a heart felt shame 
 Cause everyones crazy everyones the same 
 So why should only Larry Curly and Moe be to blame 
 Time now to take you to a different place 
 Where peace lovin whales flow through liquid outer space 
 A groovin and a gliddin as graceful as lace 
 A never losing touch with the oceans embrace 
 Diviner than the dolphin that there is none 
 Cause dolphins justa like to have a lot of fun 
 No one tells em how their life is run 
 And no one points at them with a gun 
 They have a lot of love for every living creature 
 The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature 
 They be movin in schools but everyones the teacher 
 Someday mister dolphin I know Im going to meet you 
 Back to the land of the policeman 
 Where he does whatever he says he can 
 Including hating you because youre a Jew 
 Or beating black ass thats nothing new 
 Trigger happy cops they just like to brawl 
 They use guns clubs gas but thats not all 
 They got pukeridden prisons and sexsick jails 
 Fuck the poor if youre rich you pay the bail 
 So support your police support your local wars 
 Thats the way to open economic doors 
 Why do we do it Cause the presidents a whore 
 We assume the position to sell the ammunition 
 What the fuck Its the American tradition 
 Along with going fishin apple pies in the kitchen 
 Isnt it bitchin seeing dead men in ditchesWarlocks in wonderland Ive got a 
 Megatropolis in my hand and a 
 Subterranean marching band that making noise for the boys in the Vatican and a 
 Little package and off we go oh tickyticky tackety tictactoe I know 
 Everybodys an Eskimo weve got another thing coming and thats our show well 
 Every night I go looking for you 
 Everyone in the world adores you 
 A little packet of something kind to find your reason 
 Coming up on it every day for 
 Look at me and its what I stay for 
 A little locket of fantasy that we believe in 
 Lilacs and contraband Ive got 
 Santa Monica in my hand a little 
 Beatlemania when I can Ive got 
 Two big bags of old Japan oh 
 Ring side and blowbyblow another 
 Main event at the old rainbow were coming 
 Right on top of the tupelo when she looks just like Bridgette Bardot 
 Make a deal with Uncle Weezer 
 Sign your name to claim 
 ChiChina Chow will try to please her 
 Sweetness came from Jane 
 Warlocks in wonderland Ive got a 
 Rockapotamus in my hand with a 
 Happy ending thats made of sand 
 With a little bit of loving is all I plan 
 A little packet of something kind yo find your reason 
 A little locket of fantasy that we believe in nowClose to my skin Im falling in someone whos been 
 Sittin by the phone Im left alone in another zone 
 John says to live above hell and my will is well 
 No one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail yeah 
 Its such a waste to be wasted in the first place 
 I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace 
 To meditate on the warmest dream 
 And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme 
 Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen 
 Somebody close that can see right through 
 Id take a fall and you know that Id do anything 
 I will for you 
 Sailin for the sun cause ththere is one that knows where Im from 
 I care for you I really do I really do 
 Come closer now so you can lie right by my side 
 Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you Im getting over myself yeah 
 Somebody close that was made for you 
 Close to my skin someone whos been Ima falling in 
 Disasters are just another star falling in my yard 
 Long to be with someone to tell I love your smellI stole your haircut and 
 Your balling personality 
 The perfect pallet for 
 A painting of morality 
 And now I come across without 
 A loss of what to be 
 Add up the two of us and 
 Then subtract the one of me 
 Come meet your maker 
 A different kind of strain 
 Ill turn you into one and 
 Then Ill turn you out for fun 
 Older than days and age 
 In fact you never were that young 
 Decended from a line 
 Of endless oppotunities 
 Ill build a mountain will 
 You bring it down and ruin it please 
 A sweet super tiger 
 Wont it be great 
 We could all do 
 What ever we want 
 What 
 Ever we want to 
 Im dreaming up the thing 
 That no one ever knew was love 
 Ill get your higher than the 
 Hawks of Hollywood above 
 Its up for grabs the ragged 
 String of possibilites 
 To walk away from this could 
 Leave me feeling ill at ease 
 We could all to 
 Ever we want toOn the corner into my car 
 I drive forever never get far 
 The 45 is slowly getting loaded 
 I send another song to my star 
 California mountains in the mornin 
 Stitch it up and get it all 
 All along the womans got a want it 
 We all walk your pavement get it off 
 Take more than your 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 A pendulum inside of my bed 
 Swingin low I hope to get hit 
 The overflow is slow but not enough no 
 Another drop will never fix it 
 Get along and get it all 
 We all walk your pavement get if off 
 Take more than your friends 
 If I call you lately 
 I could be your man 
 I could be your greatness 
 I shut it down the look in my eyes 
 Knock em dead a covered in flies 
 The big sleep without a bed of roses 
 The light of day will never tell lies 
 We all walk your pavement 
 On the river into my dock 
 I paddle thought the shadow and fog 
 To ponder all of those who came before me 
 Another piece for building my archI think Ill go on a walkabout 
 And find out what its all about 
 And that aint hard 
 Just me and my own two feet 
 In the heat Ive got myself to meet 
 A detective of perspective 
 I need to try to get a bigger eye 
 Open wide 
 Bloodwood flowers in my gaze 
 Walkabout in a sunny days 
 Do me now 
 On a walkabout 
 You could do it in the city 
 You could do it in a zone 
 You could do it in desert 
 You could do the unknown 
 High desert skies are what I spy 
 So fly  you gotta wonder why 
 The stingrays must be fat this year 
 Im moving slow in my lowest gear 
 The digirido original man with a dream 
 I believe the Aborigine 
 You could do it with a shuffle 
 You could do it with a stroll 
 You could do it with a stride 
 A walk could cure most all my blues 
 Bare feet or in my two shoes 
 One two 
 I think Ill go on a walkabout 
 Use your legs to rock it wide 
 Take a ride to the other sideThe freakiest show I know is the show of my own 
 Living my life in and out of the twilight zone 
 Bust my britches bless my soul 
 Im a freak of nature walking totem pole 
 Look and see I think youll agree 
 Nobody weird like me 
 Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me 
 Hell bent on inventing a new species 
 Riding down the path on the back of a giraffe 
 Me and the giraffe laughed cause I passed some gas 
 Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream 
 Well everything is never just as it seems 
 The freakiest show I know is the show of my own 
 Living my life in and out of the twilight zonePumping the blood through the heart of New Orleans 
 Shes the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream 
 Shes just made out of flesh and bones 
 But let me tell you little boy you better leave her alone 
 Leroy Brown thought he was bad too 
 Till she left him floating in the old bayou 
 Shes the kind of girl shes built like a bomb 
 Shes the blackeyed blackeyed blackeyed blonde get down 
 That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch 
 French electric sexacock shocking swamp fox 
 Heaten queen of sleaze shes hot to box 
 But let me tell you little boy shell clean your clock 
 A slick and sly spy stuck in the muck of the moat 
 Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat 
 Doubleodooms day for Mr James Bond 
 Shes the blackeyed blackeyed blackeyed blonde get downWhen will it come around 
 The wind that will inspire 
 When will it make a sound 
 The sound I desire 
 Cause we all need something to do 
 A certain something thats true 
 Floating upstream Ive seen 
 The spider and the snake 
 A trip without pause when 
 I saw my mistake 
 All my life I have known who I am 
 A troubled man but I stand 
 All my life I have seen what it means 
 To be myself in this dream 
 A certain someone thats youI was riding 
 Riding on my bike 
 Me with my friend 
 Were so alike 
 Am I all alone 
 She said all we 
 Have is this 
 We just had to stop 
 And share a kiss 
 One hot minute 3x 
 And Im in it come and get it 3x 
 If I chase it 
 I might waste it 
 Come and get it 
 Sitting in the fire 
 Get along and have some fun 
 Floating to be higher 
 Maybe Im your special one 
 Silent testifier 
 Breathe the moon 
 And eat the sun 
 Close your eyes 
 And click your heels 
 Can you believe 
 How good it feels 
 One hot minute x3 
 And Im in it come and get it 
 If a chase it I might waste it 
 A tiny wink is all 
 All we have 
 No its not much more 
 But dont get mad 
 Three lbs of love 
 Inside my skull 
 A million more lives 
 Its never drill 
 Just a few times spun 
 Spun around the sun 
 A couple more or less 
 And then were doneThe crimson tide is flowing through 
 Your fingers as you sleep 
 The promise of a clean regime 
 Are promises we keep 
 Do you like it rough I ask 
 And are you up to task 
 The calicos of Pettibon 
 Where cultures come to clash 
 Several of my best friends wear 
 The colors of the crown 
 And Mary wants to build it up 
 And Sherri wants to tear it all back down girl 
 The savior of your light 
 The monarchy of roses 
 The monarchy of roses tonight 
 The cross between my former queen 
 Her legendary stare 
 The holy tears of Ireland 
 A lovely cross to bear 
 Several of my best friends know 
 The secrets of this town 
 And Mary wants to raise it up 
 And Sherri wants to spin it all around girl 
 The sailors of the night 
 Hey 
 We all want the rose you know 
 I said hey 
 Show us love before you go 
 Say I will then say I want to 
 The story knows that I will never taunt you 
 The story knows that I will always haunt you 
 HeyWell my friend Bobs in jail today 
 His girlfriend is too 
 For stealing change for gasoline 
 Nothing to do but rue 
 Destroy the bruise  
 Cause there will never be another one just like you no 
 Bob 
 I met him on the boulevard Hollywood and Vine 
 He said Youre gonna be a superstar 
 I said Thats fine sublime 
 He loved my crime 
 But there will never be another one just like you no 
 Bob 
 I never see you 
 Something something all through the night 
 Blackest flag at dawn 
 A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong thats wrong 
 Please be lifelong 
 Killing yourself that would be an awesome oath 
 This song is so far away  
 Remember the home and how they left us alone  
 Remember our friendship 
 Stealing everything in the store 
 You know I want you to stay 
 Friends fade away 
 Well my friend Bobs insane today 
 I know I am too 
 The mental patients laugh and cry 
 BobWelcome friends to my thoughts of when 
 The fax city 4 were four young men 
 Time has come and now we jam 
 With the uplift mofo party plan 
 Were the organic antibeat box band 
 One comes from the Holy Land 
 Another was born an Australian 
 Me Im from Michigan 
 But Hollywood is the land of lands 
 Its a Hollywood jam 
 We represent the Hollywood kids 
 Hollywood is where we live 
 We represent the Hollywood jam 
 Organic antibeat box band 
 Life is grand in the land of lands 
 The mind does boggle the mind expands 
 The anarchy 4 have manned their craft 
 Get on your knees and shake your ass 
 To the jam that is 
 We dont ask we demand 
 That you and your clan 
 Listen now to this jam 
 To the power of the drummer cause the drummer is bad 
 Theres a party in my town at 1200 
 Theres a party thats rockin down to the rock 
 Ive got nothin against hip hop 
 But theres a party in my town 
 And no beat box 
 Jam that is 
 The partys got girls the girls got hot 
 The partys got boys and the boys got socks 
 Something popped the doors unlocked 
 House got up ran around the block 
 Sit down house 
 Take off your blouse 
 Any good friend of the lollypop kids 
 Over the rainbow with the wizz 
 With the organic antibeat box band 
 You just might slam 
 Dance that is 
 Its a Hollywood jamWell I was not created in the likeness of a fraud 
 Your hell is something scary I prefer a loving god 
 We are not the center of this funny universe 
 And what is worse I do not serve in fear of such a 
 Curse 
 Shallow be thy game 2000 years look in the mirror 
 You play the game of shame you tell your people live in fear 
 A rival to the way you see the Bible let him be 
 Im a threat to your survival and your control company 
 Youll never burn me 
 I will be your heretic 
 You cant contain me 
 I am the power free 
 Truth belongs to everybody 
 To anyone whos listening youre not born into sin 
 The guilt they try and give you puke it in the nearest bin 
 Missionary madness sweep up culture with a broom 
 Trashing ancient ways is par for the course its 
 Fucking rude 
 To think that youre above the laws of nature what a joke oh 
 Purple sashes feeding masses smoke on which to choke 
 Well I might be a monkey when it comes to being holy 
 Fundamental hatred get down on your knees and 
 Oh yeah 
 I was not created in the likeness of a fraud 
 Truth belongs to everybody x2Someone spilled blood many years ago 
 Someone spilled blood but do you know 
 That from the backwoods 
 Where the Chuck Berries grow 
 Come your long tall 
 Daddies of a rock and roll 
 Take me to your backwoods now 
 Spinning down from the clouds 
 Like a tornado 
 Spinnin out of control 
 Like a psychedelic soul 
 With a rhythm hittin harder 
 Than Larry Holmes 
 Daddies of rock and roll 
 Mr Uplift Mofo  my man Bo Diddley 
 Hit sippin a bottle of nickel ripple 
 Play the lickity split finger licking licks 
 For all you wicked city slick chicks 
 And all you nitty gritty hick 
 Well make your nipples ripple 
 Make you wanna dip your dipple 
 Make you wanna soak your hickory stick 
 Thats right 
 Because my man has a grip on it 
 And I do mean on it 
 Which brings to mind 
 A very sinister minister kind of guy 
 A man named Little Richard 
 Who was born to make them bitches stir 
 Thats right hell make the sweet substance drip 
 From the middle of your hillbilly lips 
 And like the farmer milks his cow 
 The Howling Wolf will howl 
 And since times does allow 
 You all can take me to your backwoods now 
 Take me to your backwoodsThey come from every state to find 
 Some dreams were meant to be declined 
 Tell the man what did you have in mind 
 What have you come to do 
 No turning water into wine 
 No learning while youre in the line 
 Ill take you to the broken sign 
 You see these lights are blue 
 Come and get it lost it at the city limit 
 Say goodbye cause they will find a way to trim it 
 Everybody looking for a silly gimmick 
 Gotta get away cant take it for another minute 
 This town is made of many things 
 Just look at what the current brings 
 So high its only promising 
 This place was made on you 
 Tell me baby whats your story 
 Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw 
 Tell me lover are you lonely 
 The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw 
 Where do you come from and where you want to go this time aw 
 Youre so lovely are you lonely 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind 
 Some claim to have the fortitude 
 Too shrewd to blow the interlude 
 Sustaining pain to set a mood 
 Step out to be reviewed 
 Ill move you like a baritone 
 Jungle brothers on the microphone 
 Getting over with an undertone 
 Its time to turn to stone 
 Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty 
 Life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty 
 What a pity Boston and a Kansas City 
 Lookin for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty 
 Three fingers in the honeycomb 
 You ring just like a xylophone 
 Devoted to the chromosome 
 The day that you left home 
 Tell me baby whats your story 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind behind 
 Oh giving up on the innocence you left behindIt must have been your funny face 
 It must have been your love 
 Must have been your paper chase 
 That wasnt quite enough 
 Must have been your tiny dance that 
 Made me laugh out loud 
 Must have been your angel dust that 
 Put me on your cloud 
 Youre the reason why 
 Youre the reason I 
 It must have been your love I said 
 It must have been your love in a little bit 
 It must have been your poppy eyes 
 That made me step outside 
 It must have been the sight of tears that 
 Let me know I cried 
 It must have been your bunny shake 
 A lot of girls wont come around they 
 Treat me like a wolf 
 It must have been your love I gotta give it that 
 Youre my angel baby 
 Youre my darling 
 Youre my star 
 Lololololita 
 Let her see me deep in love 
 Youre my angel baby 
 Lopsided eyes and a crooked frown 
 Make more of life just settle down 
 Every single little princess needs a crown 
 It must have been your loveFloozies at the rainbow 
 Superstars that wont get far 
 Who is who that we know 
 Coochie Coo is at the bar 
 Do you really love 
 Do you love do you love 
 Do you want to make the call 
 We all long we all fall 
 Shoelace for the sirens 
 Groupies and the tyrants ply 
 Do you really want 
 Do you want do you want 
 Do you want to have it all 
 We all long we all fall 
 Im so tired 
 Well I get by 
 But I could use a few 
 That I slept 
 Along the way 
 A suitcase of perception 
 Rhinestones and redemption cries 
 The sun beats down 
 Upon my lonely face 
 Do you love do you chase 
 Do you take this town today 
 We all long we all face 
 And Im so tired 
 A perfect world 
 With all its perfect places 
 I could use a few 
 For just in cases 
 Along the wayYou are my god you are my dog 
 You kept me close love never lost 
 I called you hippie you said fuck off 
 Said your brothers a real punk rocker 
 Something gonna happen 
 Something very soon 
 Transcending flesh could be a breeze 
 Sending me oh over the Moon 
 Friends near death you gave respect 
 Sympathetic Intellect 
 Choices are for one and all 
 All we are is leaves that fall 
 Thats all 
 Always be loving you 
 Now Im away from you 
 Round and round inside your head 
 Smartest fucker I ever met 
 Vicious fish bit at your toes 
 Made you lie and numb your soul 
 Mule donkey ass you bore the load 
 Of all creations tortured souls 
 Choices are for one and all 
 All we are are leaves that fall 
 I like no other I love you youre my brother 
 Water flowing and I will drink it 
 I will drink for you 
 A part of me left that only you knew 
 Will never be understood 
 Hey gone to stay 
 Entire lifetime flash before me 
 In a loving stream 
 Hey mother may I have lost a child 
 But she gave birth 
 To a loving stream 
 Ooh never know 
 When the gods will come and 
 Take you 
 Ooh heart of gold 
 The most special things you gave me were 
 From your loving stream 
 Fuck the magazines 
 Fuck the green machine 
 See the human being 
 Fuck the legal greed 
 Fuck the nothing scene 
 See the family 
 In a loving streamYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Shes stone cold bush yeah 
 And baby thats alright 
 And thats alright with me 
 Get up off your knees come on walk with me 
 Tell me what you need to get along 
 A statue come to life I cut you with my knife 
 Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger 
 Shes stone cold bush 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Haight Street got nothing to show 
 Except the skirt on your ass 
 When youre living on the streets youve got to let it roll 
 Get on with what youve got 
 Aw everybody knows that its alright 
 Youve got no secrets to tell 
 But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock 
 You do it oh so well 
 Shes got marble eyes sweet china doll her thighs 
 An animal in pain she starts to cry 
 Her pipes are open wide she blows more than my mind 
 Echo the sounds of soul time after time 
 Shes stone cold bushAll you slingers and fiends 
 Hide behind your rocks 
 Put down your gloves 
 Im not here to box 
 This is no showdown 
 So throw down your guns 
 You see it doesnt matter 
 Where you come from 
 You could be from Park Ave 
 Or from a park bench 
 You could be a politician 
 Or a bitchy princess 
 But if youre lookin for a fist 
 And youre lookin to unite 
 Put your knuckleheads together 
 Make a fist and fight 
 Not to your death 
 And not to your grave 
 Im talkin bout that freedom 
 Fight like a brave 
 Fight like a brave  dont be a slave 
 No one can tell you youve got to be afraid 
 If youre sickasick n tired 
 Of being sick and tired 
 If youre sick of all the bullshit 
 And youre sick of all the lies 
 Its better late than never 
 To setaset it straight 
 You know the lie is dead 
 So give yourself a break 
 Get it through your head 
 And get it off your chest 
 Get it out your arm 
 Because its time to start fresh 
 You want to stop dying 
 The life you could be livin 
 Im here to tell a story 
 But Im also here to listen 
 No Im not your preacher 
 And Im not your physician 
 Im just trying to reach you 
 Im a rebel with a mission 
 You say youre running and youre running 
 And youre running afraid 
 You say you ran across the planet 
 But you couldnt get away 
 The fire in your brain 
 Was driving you insane 
 You were looking for a day 
 In a life that never came 
 So dont tell me that 
 Ive got to take a number 
 Cause Ive been to that doctor 
 And believe me thats a bummer 
 Hes one of a kind 
 Convention of the mind 
 And dont forget to mention 
 That it doesnt cost a dime 
 Come as you like 
 And leave any time 
 And one more thing 
 You know it doesnt have to rhyme 
 No one can tell you youve got to be afraidPsychic spies from China try to steal your minds elation 
 Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations 
 And if you want these kind of dreams its Californication 
 Its the 
 Edge of the world and all of western civilization 
 The sun may rise in the East at least its settled in a finer location 
 Its understood that Hollywood sells Californication 
 Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging 
 Celebrity skin is this your chin or is that war youre waging 
 Firstborn unicorn 
 Hardcore soft porn 
 Dream of Californication 
 Marry me girl be my fairy to the world be my very own constellation 
 A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information 
 And buy me a star on the Boulevard its Californication 
 Space may be the final frontier but its made in a Hollywood basement 
 And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off 
 Station to Station 
  
 And Alderaans not far away its Californication 
 Ooh ooh 
 Born and raised by those who praise control of population 
 Everybodys been there and I dont mean on vacation 
 Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation 
 And earthquakes are to a girls guitar theyre just another good vibration 
 And tidal waves couldnt save the world from Californication 
 Sicker than the rest there is no test but this is what youre craving 
 Dream of CalifornicationBurning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch 
 Burn it up no need to reconcile 
 Come and see me Im your west end perfect stranger in America 
 Lady on that states so full of style 
 Stand up turn around beat it out 
 You gotta sound Joe 
 Swing low and now I know 
 Its hard to let a brother go Joe 
 The many boots that you have laced could tell a story comin night and day  
 No one said that you would need a crowd 
 The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make 
 And now I only see your face in clouds 
 Tell me so  
 Do you know 
 Does it show 
 When Im low 
 And then again when I feel your love from far away I think of yesterday 
 I see a family we know how to smile 
 There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along 
 There comes a time when we will walk that mile 
 Its hard to let a brother go JoeMy love comes 
 And when it does 
 Its a crazy kind of 
 Selective affection 
 My love flows like a wise guys tie 
 In the zaniest of directions 
 My love protection my love erection 
 You better get some of my infection 
 My love can be bigger than 
 The hoover dam 
 My love can hide behind 
 A grain of sand 
 My love for life is fueled by 
 The love for my man 
 I love his mother and 
 The silly mystic man 
 Some people think hes bad 
 They say he doesnt laugh 
 And ask my dad 
 My love is death to apartheid rule 
 My love is deepest depth the ocean blues 
 My love is the zulu groove 
 My love is keep it or move 
 My love is a laughin boozed 
 My love is the pussy juice 
 My love cant be refused 
 My love is gettin my food 
 My love my love 
 My love began from love 
 My love for an unknown grubby bum 
 My love for the baby suckin on his thumb 
 My love for the best set of buns 
 My love for the feel of the drums 
 My love for a butter knuckle hands 
 My love for the swedes in the band 
 My love for the legs that I spin 
 My love for the fat mingy 
 My love is my gross inner self 
 My love is my dick in my head 
 My love is my dick in my headFeeling good and I dont know why 
 Another day and another high 
 I walk around like I am on the ray 
 Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei 
 I met a girl and I liked her vibe 
 Another day and another ride 
 I met a girl who wants to save the world 
 Make it safe 
 For someone else to find their faith 
 Im away Im away Im away Im away 
 Im away Im away Im away 
 Hanalei 
 Im away 
 A simple song and it made me cry 
 I really dont want to pass me by 
 A simple song that spoke of Hemingway 
 The revolution in your blood 
 Creates the wave 
 I picked her up on the road to surf 
 Looked a lot like a Mother Earth 
 She said Hello my name is Charlotte Gray hey 
 Im awayIf you want me to stay 
 Ill be around today 
 To be available for you to see 
 Im about to go there 
 Then youll know 
 For me to stay here 
 Ive got to be me 
 Youll never be in doubt 
 Thats what its all about 
 You cant take me for granted and smile 
 Count the days Im gone 
 Forget reachin me by phone 
 Cause I promise 
 Ill be gone for a while 
 And when you see me again 
 I hope that you have been 
 The kind of person 
 That you really are now 
 You got to get it straight 
 How could I ever be late 
 When youre my woman 
 Taking up my time 
 Oh how could I ever allow 
 I guess I wonder how 
 I could get out a pocket for fun 
 When you know that 
 Youre never number two 
 Number ones gonna be number one 
 Ill be good 
 I wish I could 
 Get this message over to you now 
 When you see me again 
 Ill be so good 
 I wish I couldLooks to me like heaven sent 
 No lullaby kids no five percent 
 Any way you want to cut that cake 
 Shes dying from the likes of abandonment 
 Lost in the valley without my horses 
 She needs somebody to hold 
 It looks to me like heaven 
 Sent this for your roughest night 
 She looks to me she looks to me all right 
 Whos going to take you home 
 And hold you when things arent so bright 
 Its a long walk down those tracks 
 Its a dirty walk in 
 Its a dirty walk back 
 Gonna learn aw way too much 
 Shootin dope in the back 
 Of a Caddillac Jack 
 Slow down the road to my back 40 
 Down in the South seas 
 Give me your mouth please 
 Resuscitation is the way I find things 
 I give you major 
 You give me minor 
 Dont fade away 
 Like an ocean liner 
 No one can tell me what my remorse is 
 God made this lady that stands before me 
 She shows the world up with a smile 
 And then she throws the fight 
 She looks to me she looks to me all right 
 Down on the bathroom floor 
 Shes searching for another light 
 She looks to me she looks to me all rightSuicide a month before I met you 
 Deep regrets I never could forget you 
 Somehow you made your way to my decade 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl 
 In the sun I see you with your guard down 
 Number one youre moving to a hard town 
 Do not dismiss the promise that you made me 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my time 
 Overkill you took another red pill 
 On the sheet is everything that you spilled 
 We are the ones you want to know right now 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo black light 
 Come again to murder your report card 
 Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard 
 You are the one I want to be stuck with 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight 
 Favor some 
 Way too young 
 Slave to none 
 Say goodbye my love 
 I can see it in your soul 
 Thought that I could make you whole 
 Let your lover sail 
 Death was made to fail 
 Sticky fingers find the way to take her 
 Crumple up another piece of paper 
 I know your days are numbered when it comes to 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life 
 Slip away into the solar system 
 Straighter rays you find a way to twist em 
 Some like it dark and now I know where to 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you 
 Serpentine I think she was an Aussie 
 Bloody hell a common kamikaze 
 Give up the ghost before you go under 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo wonder 
 Kicking hard and looking for a rescue 
 Watch me starve was never to impress you 
 I would have killed the part of me to have you 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo story 
 Babe I know love is a funny thing 
 Born to die in the eternal spring 
 Your flickering is more than just a small flame 
 Welcome to the party its a ball game 
 Pick up the stick its time to get hit with 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat 
 Suicide is never going to save you 
 When I cried it was because I came to 
 You are the one I want to know right now 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss thisFlashin lots of cash and spendin lotsoloot 
 Hes sitting at the bar  then hes sittin at the booth 
 Across the dance floor he does scoot 
 Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit 
 The caboose that could he goes toot toot 
 Been known to gag and sometimes puke 
 A very good friend of granny goose 
 Skinny sweaty man in the green suit 
 Hes half man and half cartoon 
 But good buddy dont be confused 
 Hes full blooded looney tune 
 Face to face with the man in the moon 
 His family doctor is doctor seuss 
 If you catch him in your soup please dont shoot 
 He was new in town 
 A free wheelin clown 
 A very funny young duke 
 Hangin under the roof 
 Of a place in time 
 United sound 
 Hell play a little guitar sing a few blues 
 Hes the kinda guy that you cant refuse 
 Despite the fact that hes no brute 
 Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move 
 Like an eight legged freak in snakeskin boots 
 Coming soon to a theatre near you 
 Skinny sweaty man in the green suitNever twentyone when everyones a sailor 
 Coming up strong at the animal bar 
 Everloving mug of Mister Norman Mailer 
 Turn another page at the animal bar 
 And it wont be long 
 No it wont be long 
 Because it cant be long 
 I I I the cry of isolation 
 I I I the high of meditation 
 I I I the sweet precipitation 
 I I I the high of depravation 
 Rain on my frustration 
 Stake my claim now break this 
 Wash me down my station 
 Makes more rain forsaken 
 In between the sky and every piece of the earth 
 One two three lets make this 
 Running through the mud Ive got a feeling of worth 
 One two three forsake this 
 All aboard the ship cause youre gonna need an ark 
 When the wet comes down youll be swimming like a shark 
 Mopping up the pain and Im a little older 
 Right as rain at the animal bar 
 I I I the mild precipitation 
 Raindrops will fall from the sky 
 Stealing their shape from your eye 
 Now we can all get some sleep 
 The water the water the water saving us from the heat 
 Some things will die in their place 
 Others will leave little trace 
 Fire will come by its day 
 The water the water the water washing it all away 
 One two three forsake thisNevermind the Pac Jam 
 Nevermind the Gap Band 
 Nevermind the Zap Band 
 Nevermind the Funk Scam

 That jives just one big flub 
 The Red Hot Chili PeppersWe got large and we got small 
 We got a swimming pool and a cannonball 
 We turn red and we turn green 
 Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen 
 Lost my mind cause Im on the plastic 
 Who knew its so damn drastic 
 Show me what it is you believe in 
 Slowly she sinks all her teeth in 
 Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans 
 Do you want to get up early in the morning 
 Take me to the river where we do the little storming 
 Hallelujah I feel it warming 
 Sitting here I count the moons 
 The orders we obeyed 
 Every night fore we go to bed 
 I watch while the others pray 
 Send it off through Delaware 
 Just make it fair for the legionnaires 
 Paint a simple portrait of my kind 
 Permission to the heartless bombs 
 GoldPlated Hate and the waitress moms 
 Serving up the stories of my mind 
 Mexico you are my neighbor 
 Home of the lets be braver 
 Give me all your sick and your tired 
 Races that we admire 
 Do you want to go dancing in Chicago 
 Trinidads got it bad for Tobago 
 Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado 
 Hallelujah a desperado 
 Coming down from the deserts where you 
 Caught a glimpse of the billionaire 
 Tell me Im the right one for the ride 
 Paper signs out on the lawns 
 Gold minds and the priceless pawns 
 Does your canyon really open wide 
 We got large and we got small 
 Its the craziest thing Ive ever seenIm a little pea 
 I love the sky and the trees 
 Im a teeny tiny little ant 
 Checking out this and that 
 I am nothing ah ah 
 So you have nothing to hide 
 And Im a pacifist 
 So I can fuck your shit up 
 Oh yeah Im small 
 Fuck you asshole 
 You homophobic redneck dick 
 Big and tough and macho 
 You can kick my ass 
 So fucking what 
 So fucking whatI got more love than anything else 
 But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health 
 Struck by the notion that there just might be 
 A method to the madness that I cannot see 
 Something for the freedom of a roughedup soul 
 Fortytwo years young is a little bit old 
 Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune 
 Got buffalo love living on the moon 
 Save this lady for me x4 
 Call me Alabama Im a Seminole prize 
 Got Times Square hair and a bedroom eyes 
 Keystone Kops and the billy bob chops 
 Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops 
 Vampire blood and a baseball glove 
 Are just a little bit of what the girl is made of 
 National crash into the big lampoon 
 With a creature coming up from the black lagoon 
 Losing ground true sounds of liberty 
 The forest of the north might hold the key 
 Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band 
 Black flag wave on on my truck my man 
 Basketball Jones and the great unknowns 
 Got cheap cologne seventysix trombones 
 Looking for the lady that wont be afraid 
 When heady needs a hammer gonna get things made 
 I got more love than anything else 
 But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my healthI saw your face 
 Elegant and tired 
 Cut up from the chase 
 Still I so admired 
 Bloodshot your smile 
 Delicate and wild 
 Give me shewolf style 
 Rip right through me 
 Silveretta the jets of a lifetime 
 Go and get her Ive got her on my mind 
 Nothing better the feeling is so fine 
 Simply put I saw your love stream flow 
 Come on baby cause theres no name for 
 Give it up and I got what I came for 
 Universally speaking 
 I take it back and you make me nervous 
 Nothing better than love and service 
 I win in the long run 
 I saw your crime 
 Dying to get high 
 Two of a kind 
 Beats all hands tonight 
 Silvretta the jets of a lifetime 
 Nothing better the feeling is so fine 
 Lets goLove is all the world 
 You say the world is gone 
 Love is all the world 
 You say its gone 
 I dont 
 The party in your eyes 
 Says someone to caress 
 A party in the sky 
 I think Ill wear a dress 
 God saves us all and tell us how it ends 
 Laugh till we fall so why cant we be friends 
 Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times 
 Work and play all day until the sun is high 
 Haley and the comets 
 Saving an old rock jam 
 The ukulele play another song Ill brag 
 Stole a lot from Peter 
 Cause had to pay your Paul 
 And when you find thats not enough 
 Hell break your fall 
 Some get on and some 
 Get off the carousel 
 I think its time to go 
 So I will fare thee well 
 Hell break your fallThrow away your television 
 Time to make this clean decision 
 Master waits for its collision now 
 Its a repeat of a story told 
 Its a repeat and its getting old 
 Throw away your television 
 Make a break big intermission 
 Recreate your super vision now 
 Renegades with fancy gauges 
 Slay the plague for its contagious 
 Pull the plug and take the stages 
 Throw away your television now 
 Oi oi oi 
 Take the noose off your ambition 
 Reinvent your intuition now 
 Salivate to repetition 
 Leviate this ill condition now 
 Its a repeat 
 Its a repeatNever too soon to be through 
 Being cool too much too soon 
 Too much for me too much for you 
 Youre gonna lose in time 
 Dont be afraid to show your friends 
 That you hurt inside inside 
 Pains part of life dont hide behind your false pride 
 Its a lie your lie 
 If you see me getting mighty 
 If you see me getting high 
 Knock me down 
 Im not bigger than life 
 Im tired of being untouchable 
 Im not above the love 
 Im part of you and youre part of me 
 Why did you go away 
 Finding what youre looking for 
 Can end up being being such a bore 
 I pray for you most every day 
 My loves with you now fly away 
 Its so lonely when you dont even know yourself 
 Its so lonely 
 Its so lonelyShes the one shes the only one 
 Shes got ripped back light 
 Gonna make me come 
 I say when I smile Im a really smile 
 I got dreams so wide like a country mile 
 I said now Ill take it 
 Its better for you 
 Somehow well make it 
 Cause thats what we do 
 Pick a star in the open sky 
 I see you see me and that is why I 
 Hop along to the cowboy beat 
 When I feel your fire jump up to me 
 Something out there 
 Where love is your only friend and 
 We are the ones 
 That will make you feel better 
 Someone to spare 
 When love is the only end and 
 In a world that has run amok 
 Ive got to set my sights just to get struck 
 I walk away from the rank and file 
 With a punched out mouth and a pack of style 
 I say shes the one shes the only one 
 Make me search myself until Im done and 
 Tell me now in a telegram 
 Do the sea of stars make a diagram and 
 And someone to spare 
 Oh yeah hell yeah yeah 
 So alive I arrive on dust 
 You can search my mind for the red on rust I said 
 Take me there and she really cares 
 Lighting up for me gonna hear my prayers 
 That will make you feel better nowShes a witch 
 A bat 
 A bonafide bore 
 Whats more  she snores 
 And that is a fact 
 Cow eyes lie 
 Yes its time to resist 
 How did I ever 
 Get into this 
 How could I ever 
 Have kissed that bitch 
 So what if shes 
 Got big tits 
 Shes the kinda girl 
 Who changes her mind really quick 
 Shes the kinda girl who 
 Wont just let things sit 
 She came like a cat 
 Like a cat to cat nip 
 She came in my lap 
 With her womanly hips 
 When I first met her 
 I came unglued 
 I played the part of 
 A blueblooded fool 
 Im through with your sewage 
 Im through with your trash 
 I always knew that Id 
 Get the last laugh 
 Like two trains on one track 
 Bound for a crash 
 Two red white and blues we were 
 Destined to clash 
 I cant fix the future 
 I cant change the past 
 Like fly by night news 
 We were not meant to last 
 Im through with your bluefish 
 Im through with your gash 
 Im through being screwed with by 
 You and your wack attack 
 Jump back for chump love 
 You wont be back for cover 
 But no no no no 
 Im no chump love sucker 
 No chump love sucker 
 I thought that your love 
 Was a matter of fact 
 But I lost my pride 
 When I realized that 
 The smack in my bag 
 And my baseball bat 
 Was all you were after 
 You dirty rat 
 Shes a bitch and a brat 
 And a living disaster 
 She thought she was fast 
 But I was faster 
 No chump love suckerKick back a little just to watch and see 
 Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery 
 Whatever your pleasure Im your punk 
 On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk 
 How I listened lo when you told me 
 That I was all you had to hold 
 How I wish it was so when you told me 
 That you were solid gold 
 Gravity free is she look at her 
 Highness on a mattress full of antimatter 
 You never left a very mellow impression 
 Your smell or your gotohell expression 
 Quixoticelixer might 
 But it probably will not fix your bite 
 Tell me now tell me how did I get 
 Your lipstick on my kite 
 I love this weather its a perfect storm 
 Just keep it coming in its perfect form 
 I love this weather cause it keep me warm 
 Everyday depression in a beautiful dress 
 Oh lady made a beautiful mess I guess 
 Dedicated mind in a medicated state 
 Is a highly overrated fate 
 Terrible is it so what you told me 
 That there is such a thing 
 Do you know that you glow when you go 
 From winter into spring 
 The madder the boy the sadder the song 
 Thats a wicked fate but the sick get strong 
 Mad boy sad song 
 Wicked fate but the sick get strong 
 Nobodys right and everyones wrong 
 I refuse to punt on fourth and long 
 Wicked fate but the sick get 
 Kick back a little just to watch and see 
 How I listened low when you told me 
 I wish it was so when you told me 
 I swear to God I could not hurt you 
 Ive got to be inside your virtue 
 I cant contain my urge to search you 
 I stand before this night no curfew 
 I long to be inside your virtue 
 My heart is swollen when I search you 
 Woo woo woo woo woo woo oh 
 Woo woo woo woo woo woo ohHere she comes in a suit and tie 
 Shepherds bush and a leopards pie 
 Shes marching to the funky beat 
 Of James Brown and his dancing feet 
 Gonna set your fish on fire 
 Pistolwhipping of desire 
 So please do not resist your fate 
 Ill pick you up yes its a date 
 How could I forget to mention 
 The bicycle is a good invention 
 Sitting there in a silent movie 
 Beside the only girl who really ever knew me 
 Happy days but sadder face 
 And heaven knows Im on the case 
 How could I forget to mention the bicycle 
 Somebody told the world 
 The beauty of your verse 
 My girl I heard it first 
 A sticky finger and a wicked taste 
 Got a lot of love and a lyrical case 
 Be sure to write it in your book 
 I promise not to look 
 I wanna smell your sunny face 
 Funny place but its never awaste 
 Id hop this fence to make amends 
 I hope this movie never ends 
 Make it up and making you my business 
 A funny buttercup gotta live for forgiveness 
 The beauty of your verseLittle Miss Lover where have you been in this world for so long 
 Well I love a lover who feels like you would you like to tag along 
 Well I really dont need any help little girl 
 But I think you can help me out anyway 
 Ah sock it to me

 For a Sue that feels like you for some time 
 Excuse me while I see if the Gypsy in me

 Ah yeah

 Throwing me down in the backseat underground

 This is the sound I listen for my love 
 Who you talking to 
 Talk to me you 
 Sound of music 
 I love you 
 Swim through me 
 Good feelings 
 Come to me 
 Sought and I found a life of making my blood sound 
 Do anything for the one I love 
 Something profound the face of God is in Sensurround

 On the beaches

 Wont you keep this 
 In between us 
 Search and seizure wake up Venus 
 The dollar bill will 
 Mentally ill Bill 
 Mom and Dad take your dont be sad pill 
 Turn the screw and 
 Twist my language

 Theres a reason for the 21 century 
 Not too sure but I know that its meant to be 
 And that its meant to be 
 Its my favorite 
 Combination 
 Coming down with the favorite nations 
 Deep flirtation 
 Mutilation 
 Learn to give and take dictation 
 Oh 
 Ohoh 
 Like the Cain and Abel 
 Time to run this table 
 Not too sure but I know thats its meant to be 
 Read me your scripture and 
 Read me your scripture

 Police helicopter shot the sky

 Police helicopter takes a nosedive 
 Police helicopter he aint shy

 Supercalifragilistic 
 Kiss me in the futuristic 
 Twisted but I must insist 
 Its time to get on top of this 
 Its right on time its right on time 
 Its right on time its right on time its right on time its right on time 
 Looking fine youre looking fine and get on 1999 
 Discard to bombard 
 Calling all you shooting stars 
 Holy cow bowwowwow 
 Now Im here Im nowhere now 
 Joan of Arc reincarnated 
 Maybe we could be related 
 So much blood to circulate 
 And so much space to decorate 
 Plain and simple pain 
 I want to but I cant complain 
 Death row let us go 
 Its time to blow up for the show 
 All the world reverberated 
 Coming through we motorcaded 
 Vibrate when we operated 
 Turning up in solidstated 
 Oh LordI was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call 
 He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall 
 Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine 
 Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline 
 Everything they said about everything 
 Was acoming undone its a life supreme 
 I do and I dont well I do and I dont oh yeah 
 Feasting on the flowers so fast and young 
 Its a light so bright that I bite my tongue 
 The next dimension show me in 
 We were moving in the world expanding your realities 
 A force of nature on the verge commanding abnormalities 
 Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears 
 Twentysix a number much too small for someones golden years 
 You get a little bit more this time when you give a little bit for your mothers kind 
 Like she always said “Oh Dont look back just look ahead” 
 You sing a little bit stronger when you remember the song of your old best friend 
 Like she always said “Oh dont look back just look ahead” 
 I do and I dont well I do and I dont oh yeahPlease start dirty 
 Its 730 
 Loss of mind and 
 Cat alertly 
 My best your rest 
 Send your call 
 And then I nest 
 Perversity in features 
 Adversity that teaches 
 Some call love more 
 Soon Ill call the rhythm song 
 Its over 
 Its over now 
 So long to doodoora 
 I dare not get a look 
 Be yourself 
 Some let her call 
 Never fall 
 See yourself 
 Sit alone and wait 
 To my own call 
 Go ballistic 
 Anarchistic 
 Smack my mouth and 
 Then you kissed it 
 So long my gun 
 Simple run and 
 Letter bum 
 Things are looking good on paper 
 Once when I was in your favor 
 This kiss from a mess 
 Send my girl riddle less 
 So long to riddle songs 
 I dare not read a song 
 Sad alone and wait 
 To my own brawl 
 Free yourself 
 Theres an only count 
 This stands for all of them 
 Just play at any tempo 
 Going mad and going mental 
 All balm said no 
 Just to let him put it wrong 
 Its time to get along 
 Its over nowFlat on my back in a lonely sprawl 
 I stare at the ceiling cause I can not fall 
 Asleep tonight 
 No not at all 
 Head lights flash across my bedroom wall 
 Crying eyes open cause I can not fall 
 In love with you 
 No not at all 
 Walk away and taste the pain 
 Come again some other day 
 Arent you glad you werent afraid 
 Funny how the price gets paid 
 Busted in two like a brittle stick 
 I can not drink because my throat constricts 
 Lovesick from you 
 That will never do 
 Open my mouth I couldnt make a sound 
 I could not scream you know I could not shout 
 It out to you 
 Nothing to do 
 This may come as a shocking surprise 
 I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye 
 Goodbye my love 
 I am not alive 
 How the price gets paidLA Lakers fast break makers 
 Kings of the court shake and bake all takers 
 Back to back is a bad ass fact 
 A claim that remains intact 
 MAGIC 
 See you on the court 
 Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart 
 Magic of the Buck 
 Other teams pray for dreams 
 But he dont give a fuck 
 Penetrating the lane like a bullet train 
 Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain 
 Knucklehead suckers better duck 
 When the Buck comes through like a truck 
 Scott stops pops and drops it in 
 On his way back gets a little skin 
 From the hand of a man named AC Green 
 Slam so hard break your TV screen 
 Worthys hot with his tomahawk 
 Take it to the hole make your mamma talk 
 I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble 
 Is coming to your town and hes going to make rubble 
 LA Lakers fast break makers 
 I see you in purple and gold 
 You can swim but you wont get far so you might as well go home 
 In Buck we trust 
 Restoring order to the court and justice is a must 
 Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly 
 Cause theyve got more moves 
 Than a bowl of jelly 
 The Buck stops here  pops  then cheers 
 A roar through the forum 
 That deafens my ears 
 The one and only know of his kind 
 Sits in a throne 
 Not for the records that he holds 
 But for being bald and bold 
 Kareem Abdul Jabbar 
 All time great super superstar 
 I hate to burst your bubble 
 But triple double trouble 
 Is coming to your town 
 And hes gonna make rubble 
 Does anybody want some Magic Johnson 
 A claim that remains intactOh good god in heaven almighty heavens to Murgatroyd weve got a cataclysmic situation developing somebody get down here now

 WhooptayWhooptaygittagalagoopta

 Dirty baby weve got a situation

 A tiny storm in your teacup girl 
 I know you can battle the masses dear 
 Oh god oh no oh no its getting worse worse by the minute uhuhuh were down here at division and 5th street somebody send for back up right now 
 Every other day you say

 Descendents had a record 
 Sayin somethin bout Milo 
 You can take the ATrain 
 But youre gonna have to lie low 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 I know we may never get out of here 
 A tiny storm in your teacup girlI was walking 
 Through a courtyard 
 Without shoes and 
 Without regard 
 Automatic catacombs 
 Take me where I wanna go 
 All around 
 All in phases 
 It astounds 
 And amazes 
 Built to last and known to roam 
 Touch me Im a chromosome 
 What time 
 Fascinated by the face of time 
 I got it to give and now were gonna make some time 
 Ultrafine and altruistic 
 Can I spy into the mystic 
 System down for infiltration 
 Open mind free of frustration 
 I was driving 
 To a safe place 
 And arriving 
 As I retraced 
 Yell into a telescope 
 Aim it at the star of hope 
 All over the yonder 
 The smell of blood and thunder 
 Im connected by the lightning rod 
 Giving the beauty to it 
 Heaven knows how well I know you 
 TimeGod is good and fate is great 
 When it feels so strong its hard to wait 
 You never know how it might unfold 
 Hearts to break and bodies to hold 
 Time will tell but it never gets old 
 Like I told you Im in for the long long 
 Had tove been one of those things that took place in outer space 
 A match made in heaven not a scratch on her face 
 Angels must have smoked some dust 
 Singing songs about In God We Trust 
 Some things slide but this is a must 
 Like I told you theres a time for finding out 
 Ah people try to tell me what not to do 
 You shouldnt make it with a younger girl and 
 Too many chances for the foot to drop 
 I tried to tell em that I found a pearl well 
 Like I told you be careful what youre asking for 
 Hey sister Brutus 
 Ive got a mess of a better half oww 
 Hey sister Judas 
 Even you never had my back 
 She was the cutest thing that I ever did see 
 A drink in her hand and I dont mean tea 
 She was with a dude but I just didnt care 
 I had to find out these moments are rare 
 And Stevie says All is fair 
 Like I told you there is something for everyone 
 Well I guess I never told you some things 
 That I really really wanted to say 
 Did I do everything I could do 
 Or did the mice just need to play 
 Like I told you theres more than meets the eye 
 I said hey sister Judas 
 Im not trying to point fingers at you 
 And Im not trying to lay any blame 
 But when it comes to the punishment girl 
 You know how to bring the pain 
 Like I told you Id do it all again 
 Come on 
 Theres a fury to the womans wrath oww 
 Even you never had my backMy boys they like to tell me when Im wrong hey now 
 My girl she like to sing now sing my song 
 Everybody tell me when Im wrong today 
 Anyway I say 
 My boys hey they like to tell me when Im bad cmon

 When Im here now when Im wrong and when Im bad

 Cmon Chad 
 My boy he like to tell me what I had 
 Yeah now what dyou do with everything youve had 
 I dont know that aint bad 
 Woo no that aint badSome people say you hate me 
 I dont believe its true 
 Things that youre going through 
 Some people say you hate me 
 I dont believe its you 
 Some people say to pray for 
 The one you want to live 
 The eyes that once were his 
 The way you want to live 
 The eyes you want to give 
 Some people say you played me 
 I dont care if its true 
 Im waiting here for you 
 Some people say you made it 
 Im not afraid to know 
 When things are getting low 
 Things that youre going throughOh give me a home 
 Where the buffalo roam 
 And the death of a race is a game 
 Where seldom is heard 
 A peacable word 
 From the white trash 
 Who killed as they came 
 Though these words dig deep 
 They offer no relief 
 God save the queen 
 I am an Indian chief 
 There is a secret I keep 
 Its called the talking leaf 
 And you better believe 
 That he speaks his beliefs 
 Like a rock that bleeds 
 A sea of grief 
 My talking leaf speaks of 
 A wounded knee creek 
 American ghost dance 
 A new man who is with old ways 
 He walks the streets of life 
 But hes in chains 
 Im alive he cried 
 I can feel the flame 
 Burning red inside 
 I am an Indian brave 
 There is a memory 
 That lives in my blood 
 Of the brand you laid 
 On all you touched 
 But the burning flame 
 Turns to burning pain 
 Genuine genocide 
 And thats truly insane 
 So like a wild hurricane 
 I will dance on the grave 
 Of my race that died 
 When it should have been saved 
 American ghost danceTime to swing a little melody 
 To make you all feel something sexually 
 And now were gonna get it on in the groove 
 The groove that makes those smooth hips move 
 We are pumpin that drivin bad rhythm 
 To make those pretty little pussy lips schism 
 Kissum kissum kissum 
 In the mind is one design 
 To make you feel fine 
 Suckin on mine with a 69 
 Im inclined to fuck fuck fuck fuck your brains out 
 For the moment come on now make her shout 
 Pump that leman till it pouts 
 Open your legs to the sensual sound 
 With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound 
 I can tell youre like a horny bloodhound 
 Feel the bass hug the ground 
 Just drop your knees and come unbound 
 And now you make your mouth to get on down 
 Our lust for notes will boil your blood 
 When they slither and slide on under your hood 
 Makin me shoot my power packed pud 
 Like a wild lady lovin a viable stud 
 Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud 
 Gettin it gettin it gettin it good 
 In my head as a hellified hum 
 I take to rubbin her on the bum 
 Adjust the lips some on the tongue 
 With my thumb I strum her plum 
 Start to make her orgasm 
 Tastes a little bit like ooh how rum 
 Well I like to make her cum 
 To the rhythm of the drums 
 Make cum make cum cumShes only 18 dont like the Rolling Stones 
 She took a shortcut to being fully grown 
 She got that mood ring her little sister Rose 
 The smell of Springsteen a pair of pantyhose 
 This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette 
 She said my man you know its time to get your fingers wet 
 You hustle faster when you cant afford a cigarette 
 The last I heard from you you were screaming handle it 
 Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head 
 The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead 
 Fascinated by the look of you and what was said 
 Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed 
 I heard some PFunk out on the road again 
 To get your head shrunk is what I recommend 
 Its in your bloodline a perfect Frankenstein 
 Out on that lone pine Im gonna make you mine 
 Its understood you wrap your voodoo right around my neck 
 Youve got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque 
 I put my lovin in your oven not a head to check 
 The last I heard from you you were screaming resurrect 
 Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shedIn a world that can be so insane 
 I dont think its very strange 
 For me to be in love with you 
 I want to know more than your brain 
 Into my life you were injected 
 Not something that I expected 
 Now I smile from your affection 
 We have made a soul connection 
 Just for whom does your bell toll 
 Dont be cold show me your soul 
 Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid 
 To show you when I am you 
 Youre my best friend 
 Show me your soul 
 In a world that can 
 Yes I find you so appealing 
 When you show me how youre feeling 
 You my friend need not be kneeling 
 Open up and stop revealing 
 Trust in me my heart is whole 
 I need to see 
 Sentimental gentlemen 
 Dont expect too much from me 
 Perfection is no test for me 
 Because the best Ill ever be 
 I just like you a human being 
 You wont offend I need to know 
 Please my friend 
 Show me your soul 
 Sentimental GentlemenStart marching 
 Cause you think you shot to number one 
 Counting days and 
 Skipping your stones into the sun 
 Over age and under thumb 
 But does it weigh a ton 
 Ill be yours tonight 
 Living the dream of a meteorite 
 Start jumping cause 
 Weve got something to say yeah 
 Young lovers keep it pumping 
 In the streets of LA yeah

 Short stroking doesnt fly 
 Better to go for broke

 Jumping the fence riding the rails 
 Can you take a joke 
 Ill be yours today 
 Living the dream with a capital K 
 Tell me now Ill tell you how 
 Just show me where to send 
 Make time for love and your happiness 
 The Mothers Of Invention are the best 
 We all know and struggle with some loneliness 
 A tender mess for everyone I guess 
 I guess 
 Half blinded 
 Im reminded how to find the stairs 
 Nickel and dimin 
 Think its time 
 To play some musical chairs 
 Dirty laundry 
 What a quandary 
 Ask her if she cares 
 Ill be yours and more 
 Better than ever like never before 
 In the streets of

 Sweet talkin 
 As Im walkin through your part of town 
 Never again 
 Will Johnny C a Love Supreme be found 
 Is it ever meant to be 
 And is it so profound 
 Is it you and me 
 A billion to one make history 
 A history 
 Said yeah 
 Said oh yeah 
 Oh yeahIn love dying 
 Theres a flawless rain 
 In love dying 
 One foot in the astral plane 
 Someones sighing 
 Theres a virgin road 
 Waiting to be strode 
 Ropes untying 
 This power I could not withhold 
 Satisfying 
 What do we contain 
 Cant stop crying 
 These tears of change 
 Remain the same 
 My girl she shoots down 
 The baddest of guys 
 She knows that they 
 Want me dead 
 She fires up the starry night 
 And fills them so full 
 So full of lead 
 Does it go two ways 
 This body I can not detain 
 Wake up flying 
 She the solar shores 
 Passers buying 
 The memories we readorn 
 Nothing to obtain 
 No crawling through 
 The halls of fame 
 Loss becomes the gain 
 Recreate me 
 So I may sustainAll my life I was swinging for the fence 
 I was looking for the triple 
 Never playing good defense 
 Gunnin for the glitter 
 Every hot and heavy hitter 
 She was never really there so I couldnt really get her 
 I said 
 Factually I Im just a piece of it 
 Factually I the very least of it 
 Piece of work I was really quite a jerk 
 Keeping score is such a bore a busy mind could go berserk 
 Feast on this I was fishing for a hook 
 So I took a little trip and I opened up the book 
 Factually I its just a medicine 
 Make you wanna cry why dont they let us in 
 Be my wife I think youre right that we should mate 
 Tell your friends I got a factory of faith 
 Late last night I had a dream that it was great 
 I got a factory of 
 Crack your whip shes confessing from the hip

 Confide with Sly youll be the wiser 
 Young blood is the lovin upriser 
 How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser 
 Give it away give it away give it away now

 Greedy little people in a sea of distress 
 Keep your more to receive your less 
 Unimpressed by material excess 
 Love is free love me say Hell yes 
 Low brow but I rock a little knowhow 
 No time for the piggies or the hoosegow 
 Get smart get down with the pow wow

 Badge out laid off 
 Says hes got a bad cough 
 Wants to get it paid off 
 Look out kid 
 Its somethin you did 
 God knows when 
 But youre doin it again 
 You better duck down the alley way 
 Lookin for a new friend 
 The man in the coonskin cap 
 In the big pen 
 Wants eleven dollar bills 
 You only got ten 
 Maggie comes fleet foot 
 Face full of black soot 
 Talkin that the heat put 
 Plants in the bed but 
 The phones tapped anyway 
 Maggie says that many say 
 They must bust in early May 
 Orders from the D A 
 Dont matter what you did 
 Walk on your tip toes 
 Dont try No Doz 
 Better stay away from those 
 That carry around a fire hose 
 Keep a clean nose 
 Watch the plain clothes 
 You dont need a weather man 
 To know which way the wind blows 
 Oh get sick get well 
 Hang around a ink well 
 Ring bell hard to tell 
 If anything is gonna sell 
 Try hard get barred 
 Get back write braille 
 Get jailed jump bail 
 Join the army if you fail 
 Youre gonna get hit 
 But losers 
 Cheaters 
 Sixtime users 
 Hang around the theaters 
 Girl by the whirlpool 
 Lookin for a new fool 
 Dont follow leaders 
 Watch the parkin meters 
 Ah get born keep warm 
 Short pants romance learn to dance 
 Get dressed get blessed 
 Try to be a success 
 Please her please him buy gifts 
 Dont steal dont lift 
 Twenty years of schoolin 
 And they put you on the day shift 
 They keep it all hid 
 Better jump down a manhole 
 Light yourself a candle 
 Dont wear sandals 
 Try to avoid the scandals 
 Dont wanna be a bum 
 You better chew gum 
 The pump dont work 
 Cause the vandals took the handlesScar tissue that I wish you saw 
 Sarcastic mister knowitall 
 Close your eyes and Ill kiss you cause 
 With the birds Ill share 
 With the birds Ill share this lonely view 
 Push me up against the wall 
 Young Kentucky girl in a pushup bra 
 Falling all over myself 
 To lick your heart and taste your health cause 
 Blood loss in a bathroom stall 
 Southern girl with a scarlet drawl 
 Wave goodbye to ma and pa cause 
 Soft spoken with a broken jaw 
 Step outside but not to brawl in 
 Autumns sweet we call it fall 
 Ill make it to the moon if I have to crawl and 
 Scar tissue that I wish you saw 
 With the birds Ill share this lonely viewBear paws and rascal power 
 Watching us in your garage 
 Big girl you ate the neighbor 
 The nova is over 
 Wake up and play 
 By the radio 
 Make room for Claras bare feet 
 The lover a Martian 
 Tick tock theyre waiting for the meteor 
 This clock is opening another door 
 Lots of love just keep it comin 
 Making something out of nothin 
 These are the best that I 
 I dont know how to say 
 Look at what I love today 
 I dont know what to say 
 Look at what I lost today 
 These are the things that I 
 Blood flowers in the kitchen 
 Signing off and winding down 
 This Martian ends her mission 
 She caught the ball 
 By the mission bell 
 Chase lizards bark at donkeys 
 Lets bow our heads 
 And let the trumpets blow 
 Our girl is gone 
 God bless her little soul 
 Losin what I love today 
 Shes got sword in case 
 Though this is not her lord in case 
 The one who cant afford to face her image is restored to grace 
 Disappeared no trace 
 Musky tear suitcase 
 The downturn brave little burn cub 
 Bear careless turnip snare rampages 
 Pitch color pages 
 Down and out but not in Vegas 
 Disembarks and disengages 
 No loft 
 Sweet pink canary cages 
 Plummet pop dew skin fortitude for the sniffing black noses 
 That snort and allude to dangling trinkets 
 That mimic the dirt cough go drink its 
 Its for you 
 Blue battered naval down slip kisses 
 Delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters 
 Arrive in time to catch the late show 
 Its a beehive barrel race 
 A shehive stare and chase 
 Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her 
 Embossed beneath a box in the closet thats lost 
 The kind that you find when you mind your own business 
 Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters 
 Into the new morning milk blanket 
 Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny 
 Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay 
 Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterdays fallen freckles awayBroke down I found 
 Even when you think you need a rest 
 You will live to fight another round 
 I know its too bad so sad 
 All the things that we couldve been and couldve had 
 Hey girl what sound 
 A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground 
 Now I found you right here 
 A million miles of water 
 You were my muse 
 Just because you happen to have a bomb doesnt mean you light the fuse 
 I know that my girl big lie 
 Four years in and you never even said goodbye 
 A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground 
 A million miles of water dear 
 I want you to remember that some times we have to go without 
 Now I found it right here 
 I want you to remember dear 
 We were two of a funny kind 
 So damn blind but now we got to nevermind 
 I know that this is the end we tried 
 So hard but now I got to lose a friend 
 I want you to remember dearDusting off your savior 
 Well you were always my favorite 
 Always my man  All in a hand 
 To celebrate you is greater 
 Now that I can  Always my man 
 Now you see what I came for 
 No one here is to blame for 
 Misunderstand  All in a hand 
 Just like you cause you made me 
 All that I am  All in a hand 
 A butterfly that flaps its wings 
 Affecting almost everything 
 The more I hear the orchestra 
 The more I have something to bring 
 And now I see you in a beautiful 
 And different light 
 Hes just a man and any damage done 
 Will be all right 
 Call out my name 
 Call and I came 
 Dusting off your savior 
 Forgiving any behavior 
 Hes just a man  All in a hand 
 Your heros destined to waver 
 Anyone can  Always my man 
 I would never betray you 
 Look at me who could raise you 
 Face in the sand  Safe in your hand 
 You were always my favorite 
 We are the red hots 
 And were loving up the lovemenots 
 The flowers in your flower pots 
 Are dancing on your table tops 
 Hes just a man and everything he does 
 The life that you have narrated 
 You were my manRoad trippin with my two favorite allies 
 Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies 
 Its time to leave this town its time to steal away 
 Lets go get lost anywhere in the USA 
 Lets go get lost lets go get lost 
 Blue you sit so pretty west of the one 
 Sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun 
 Just a mirror for the sun 
 These smiling eyes are just a mirror for 
 So much has come before those battles lost and won 
 This life is shining more forever in the sun 
 Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf 
 Staying high and drys more trouble than its worth in the sun 
 In Big Sur we take some time to linger on 
 We three hunky dorys got our snakefinger on 
 Now let us drink the stars its time to steal away 
 Lets go get lost right here in the USA 
 Sparkles light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun 
 Your smiling eyes are just a mirror forA wannabe gangster thinking hes a wise guy 
 Rob another bank hes a sockemintheeye guy 
 Tank head Mr Bonnie and Clyde guy 
 Look him in the eye hes not my kinda guy 
 Never wanna be confusion proof 
 Puddings sweet but too aloof 
 Orangeeye girl with a backslide dew said 
 Yo homie who you talking to 
 A backed up paddywagon mackin on a cats ass 
 One uppercut to the cold upper middle class 
 Born to storm on boredoms face 
 And a little lust to the funkyass Flea bass 
 Most in the race just lose their grace 
 The blackest hole in all of space 
 Crooked as a hooker now suck my thumb 
 Anybody wanna come get some 
 If you have to ask youll never know 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go oh woh woh 
 Dont ask me why Im flying so high 
 Mr Bubble meets Superfly in my third eye 
 Searching for a soul bride shes my freakette 
 Soak it up inside deeper than a secret 
 Much more than meets the eye 
 To the funk I fall into my new ride 
 My hand my hand 
 Magic on the one is a medicine man 
 Thinking of a few taboos that I ought to kill 
 Dancing on their face like a stage in vaudeville 
 I feel so good cant be understood 
 Booty of a hoodlum rocking my red hood 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go oh woh wohDoes it go from east to west ya 
 Body free and a body less ya 
 Come again just to start afresh and 
 Once again to find a home 
 In the moment of the meantime 
 Dropping in coming through the mesh ya 
 Checking in just to get it blessed ya 
 Hard to leave when its picturesque 
 Find a form thats free to roam 
 Ah Where you come from 
 Ah Where you going 
 Do it all then it all again ya 
 Make it up and you make a friend ya 
 Paddle on just around the bend and 
 Find a place where you can see 
 All the mamas and the papas 
 Take a chance on a recommend ya 
 Hard as hell just to comprehend ya 
 Disbelief that I do suspend and 
 Easy now to find a breeze 
 We all want to tell her 
 Tell her that we love her 
 Venice gets a queen 
 Best Ive ever seen 
 We all want to kiss her 
 Tell her that we miss her 
 Best Ive ever 
 I know you said you dont believe 
 In God do you still disagree 
 Now that its time for you to leave

 Bought it all and its all untrue I

 Desperate and it shows 
 In the name of spending street 
 Burning bush and a busted knee you

 Somewhere in Mexico

 A simple point of view 
 Someone too deeper to 
 Aw 
 Searching for an Eskimo 
 Searching and I wanna know someone like you

 Before I undergo 
 Ooh aw 
 Hey hey hey 
 In the name of Oscar Wilde I 
 Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I 
 Go toe to toe in the whole world to find an EskimoPorcelain 
 Are you wasting away in your skin 
 Are you missing the love of your kin 
 Drifting and floating and fading away 
 Porcelain 
 Do you smell like a girl when you smile 
 Can you bear not to share with your child 
 Little lune 
 All day 
 Do you carry the moon in your womb 
 Someone said that youre fading too soon 
 Nodding and melting and fading away 
 Little lune x2Deep inside these sleeping shallows 
 Far away where no one goes now 
 Take my place in Gordon Spacer 
 TV star that no one knows now 
 Deep deep mystery is talking to me 
 Shes a giver of constant animation 
 All around and ready to make a new formation 
 Youre the reason Im in this world 
 I dont believe in everything I see 
 Rivers of Avalon 
 Your supernatural energy 
 Part of my scenery 
 What I belong to is your ecstacy 
 Your faith gone wavering is key 
 The clone of my own lonliness 
 Has got to be what am I known to 
 Little darlin in your starlin 
 Loving ways that Ive succumbed to 
 Shes a giver of constant adulation 
 Wadda you see in me 
 Your the reason Im in this world 
 All out in meAll of my love 
 And most of my fears 
 Been comin on strong 
 For most of my 
 Years add up 
 And end up in a song 
 Cellophane tweeds 
 And revenue streams 
 Blockin my shots 
 And killin my 
 Dreams that showed me 
 How to be the cause 
 Ooh ah yella ooh ah hey ah what now 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man 
 Its a longtime for me I see 
 Shes wants to belong and 
 I want to be free 
 Excommunicated 
 Cause there aint no guarantee 
 Ooh ah yella ooh ah 
 All of my friends 
 And enemies near 
 Were part of this dance 
 That put me right 
 So glad I got this chance 
 Better know plans 
 And lesser known schemes 
 Were all about love 
 And less about 
 Me Id have to say 
 She wore the pants 
 Thats oh 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man thats right 
 Its a longtime for me uhuh 
 Woo Yeah 
 Ah 
 Go 
 Ive been left 
 Its the lifetime of a strange man thats me 
 Its a long time for me uhuh 
 She wants to be rich 
 And I want to be free 
 Keep your plans elastic 
 Cause there aint no guaranteeDeck 
 You start by doing that first okay 
 Okay here we go 
 Deck deck 
 Not you not you 
 Deck deck deck 
 Deck no deck 
 Deck the halls with boughs of holly 
 Falalalalalalalala 
 Tis the season to be jolly 
 Don we now our gay apparel 
 Something something Yuletide carol 
 Merry ChristmasThis is the place where all the junkies go 
 When time gets fast but everything gets slow 
 Can I get some vaseline 
 Step into a modern scene 
 Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream 
 I dont wanna do it like my daddy did 
 I dont wanna give it to my babys kid 
 This is my calling 
 I said my darling 
 Shocking appalling 
 All I can do to you 
 Hammers are falling 
 This is the place where all the devils plead 
 Their case to take from you what they need 
 Can I isolate your gene 
 Can I kiss your dopamine 
 In a way I wonder if shes living in a magazine 
 I dont wanna say it if it isnt so 
 I dont wanna weigh it but Ive gotta know 
 I saw you out there yesterday 
 What did you want to say 
 A perfect piece of DNA 
 Caught in a flashing ray 
 I caught you out there in the fray 
 A masterpiece of DNA 
 Can I smell your gasoline 
 Can I pet your wolverine 
 On the day my best friend died I could not get my carpet clean 
 I dont wanna take it up with little Joe 
 I dont wanna fake it but Ive gotta know 
 I am a misfit 
 Im born with all of it 
 The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split 
 Im in a flash ray 
 A mash of DNA 
 Another poppin Jay who thinks hes got something to saySomeone 
 There are no worries for someone 
 Lifes in no hurry for someone 
 There are no worries for 
 Nothing major or too complicated 
 Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated 
 For someone 
 Someone 
 Cut my heart out 
 With a feather 
 And put an end 
 To any extra pressure 
 Ride around on mellow waves of mercy 
 And fill the space with lack of controversy 
 Set it up to follow you 
 On my aeroplane 
 Heres a present 
 For the future memory lane 
 Light it up the room 
 She sang into any twane 
 Hit em up cause you got me 
 A moth to your flame 
 There are no worries for me 
 For me 
 For meShade stay know all 
 But they communicate 
 Try fade 
 The leverage of space 
 Star jay 
 The fall dawn aim to place 
 With shades on 
 The leverage of 
 Shade shade shade 
 The leverage of the leverage of 
 Space shade shade 
 Hate breaks down 
 Mountains that we 
 Make so tame 
 Oh the leverage of 
 When I was down upon myself 
 I walked a road thats always there 
 You and I were everywhere 
 And Im alone 
 She would never know the reason 
 That I loved to come and see her 
 Where she sits Ill never go 
 You know its always there 
 The leverage of the leverage ofE I O I E I A 
 When you give your love away 
 You get a feeling for

 Live to love another day 
 Even when you feel unsure 
 More and more I wanna raise 
 Raise my bar and raise your stakes 
 When I lay there wide awake 
 For my son Ill make 
 Tell my boy I love him so 
 Tell him so he knows 
 Lost in Ethiopia 
 Walk out in that road 
 Something good gonna come your way 
 Just look out your door 
 Tell em what you wanna say 
 No matter what you might incur 
 Steal my heart to give away 
 Make me wanna say 
 You and I are sewn the same 
 More and more and more each day 
 Walk out in that roadThere must be something in the way I feel 
 That she dont want me to feel 
 The stare she bears cut me 
 I dont care you see so what if I bleed 
 I could never change just what I feel 
 My face will never show what is not real 
 A mountain never seems to have the need to speak 
 A look that shares so many seek 
 The sweetest feeling I got from you 
 The things I said to you were true 
 I could have lied Im such a fool 
 My eyes could never never never keep their cool 
 Showed her and I told her how 
 She struck me but Im fucked up now 
 But now shes gone yes shes gone away 
 A soulful song that would not stay 
 You see she hides cause she is scared 
 But I dont care I wont be spared 
 I showed her and I told her how 
 Fucked up nowHow long how long will I slide 
 Separate my side I dont 
 I dont believe its bad 
 Slitting my throat its all I ever 
 I heard your voice through a photograph 
 I thought it up and brought up the past 
 Once you know you can never go back 
 I gotta take it on the other side 
 Centuries are what it meant to me 
 A cemetery where I married the sea 
 Stranger things could never change my mind 
 Take it on the other side 
 Take it on take it on 
 How long how long will I slide 
 Pour my life into a paper cup 
 The ashtrays full and Im spilling my guts 
 She wants to know Am I still a slut 
 A scarlet starlet and shes in my bed 
 A candidate for a soulmate bled 
 Push the trigger and pull the thread 
 Turn me on take me for a hard ride 
 Burn me out leave me on the other side 
 I yell and tell it that its not my friend 
 I tear it down I tear it down and then its born again 
 How long how long 
 I dont I dont believe its bad 
 Slitting my throat its all I everSometimes I feel like I dont have a partner 
 Sometimes I feel like my only friend 
 Is the city I live in the city of angels 
 Lonely as I am together we cry 
 I drive on her streets cause shes my companion 
 I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am 
 She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy 
 Well I never worry now that is a lie 
 And I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Take me to the place I love take me all the way 
 I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Yeah yeahyeah 
 Its hard to believe that theres nobody out there 
 Its hard to believe that Im all alone 
 At least I have her love the city she loves me 
 Well I dont ever want to feel like I did that day 
 Oh no no no yeahyeah 
 Love me I said yeah yeah 
 One time 
 Under the bridge downtown

 Two lips and a sturdy stem 
 A funny thing always happens when

 Cowgirl and a troubadour 
 MGM and the lions roar 
 A straight shot to the corner store

 So much I wish I could 
 So many I wish I would 
 Count on you not to deplete me 
 Count on you not to defeat me 
 Please dont turn away again 
 Please dont turn me into them 
 Please dont turn away a friend 
 Stand by for the great eclipse 
 Rip it out now shake your hips 
 Backing off the apocalypse

 Count on you not to complete me 
 What you wanna do about it 
 Please dont turn me into themBecause Im happy to be sad 
 I want it all I want it bad 
 Oh its what I know 
 A vintage year for pop I hear 
 The middle of the end is near 
 Lets go oh its what I know 
 Torture me and torture me 
 Forcin me so torture me please 
 Torture me with sorcery 
 All the leaves are turning brown 
 The wind is pushing me around 
 Lets go its what I know 
 Its forcin me so torture me please 
 The will of God is standing still 
 Brazilian children get their fill 
 Lets go 
 Lets turn it up and dumb it down 
 The vision of your ultra sound 
 Is so 
 And all the leaves are turning brown 
 A vintage year for pop I hear 
 Its so 
 Its forcin me and so torture me please 
 Forcin me so torture me pleaseI am a man cut from the know 
 Rarely do friends come and then go 
 She was a girl soft but estranged 
 We were the two our lives rearranged 
 Feeling so good that day 
 A feeling of love that day 
 Twisting and turning your feelings are burning 
 Youre breaking the girl 
 She meant you no harm 
 Think youre so clever but now you must sever 
 He loves no one else 
 Raised by my dad girl of the day 
 He was my man that was the way 
 She was the girl left alone 
 Feeling the need to make me her home 
 I dont know what when or why 
 The twilight of love had arrived 
 He loves no one elseWhy do you do what you do 
 I do what I want to do 
 Who said you could do what you do 
 I told you who told me to 
 Funky crime funky crime 
 Dont you know funks colours blind 
 Well Ive committed a funky crime 
 Against a state of mind 
 Hey you mister interview 
 I dont have to answer you 
 This is what I grew into 
 Dont judge me and my soul stew 
 Funk is my attitude 
 Barriers of race 
 In the media take place 
 Tellin you there is no room 
 For what you do dont budge 
 Theres no groove to your cold gloom 
 And who made you the judge 
 Always room for funky tunes 
 And yes I funk it up 
 I funk it up 
 Funky boy 
 Meets a funky girl 
 Make it funky baby 
 Cause the funk is crazy 
 Why do you do what you do 
 Funky crime 
 A funky funky crime 
 The crime is funkyBang on my window if 
 You want to get your look out 
 I felt the wind blow when 
 She took her little book out 
 Im steady loving on the 
 Lady of these pages 
 Another chapter if you will 
 So advantageous 
 Down on the river tonight 
 Take off your glasses and fight 
 Under the hula moon Im 
 Going to pop the culture 
 Blue cherry dress on you 
 Is looking like a sculpture 
 This recreation is amusing 
 And confusing 
 You never knew that it 
 Could feel so good while losing 
 What you lose 
 Your virginity 
 Ill be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 Get so emotional 
 I got a notion for 
 And when a star gets bent 
 Ill be your parliament 
 My intuition was a 
 Poppin and a shakin 
 The very thought of it was 
 All too much to take in 
 Curl up with lover we 
 Could lie out on the blanket 
 This canopy above Ill 
 Take the time to thank it 
 Take off your panties and fight 
 I want to bury my face 
 Deep in your aroma 
 Her name is Lisa 
 But they call her Desdemona 
 Come out and see me for 
 Some street communication 
 I think its sweet of you 
 To be my motivation 
 Sit back and watch it flowCant stop addicted to the shindig 
 Chop top he says Im gonna win big 
 Choose not a life of imitation 
 Distant cousin to the reservation 
 Defunkt the pistol that you pay for 
 This punk the feeling that you stay for 
 In time I want to be your best friend 
 Eastside love is living on the West End 
 Knocked out but boy you better come to 
 Dont die you know the truth is some do 
 Go write your message on the pavement 
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
 White heat is screaming in the jungle 
 Complete the motion if you stumble 
 Go ask the dust for any answers 
 Come back strong with fifty belly dancers 
 The world I love the tears Ive dropped 
 To be part of the wave cant stop 
 Ever wonder if its all for you 
 The world I love the trains I hop 
 Come and tell me when its time to 
 Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone 
 So smart shes leading me to ozone 
 Music the great communicator 
 Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
 Ill get you into penetration 
 The gender of a generation 
 The birth of every other nation 
 Worth your weight the gold of meditation 
 This chapters going to be a close one 
 Smoke rings I know youre going to blow one 
 All on a spaceship persevering 
 Use my hands for everything but steering 
 Cant stop the spirits when they need you 
 Moptops are happy when they feed you 
 J Butterfly is in the treetop 
 Birds that blow the meaning into bebop 
 To be part of the wave cant stop 
 Wait a minute Im passing out win or lose 
 Just like you 
 Far more shocking than anything I ever knew 
 How about you 
 Ten more reasons why I need somebody new 
 Right on cue 
 Cant stop addicted to the shindig 
 Choose not a life of imitation 
 Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
 In time I want to be your best friend 
 Kick start the golden generator 
 Sweet talk but dont intimidate her 
 Cant stop the gods from engineering 
 Feel no need for any interfering 
 Your image in the dictionary 
 This life is more than ordinary 
 Can I get two maybe even three of these 
 Coming from space to teach you of the Pleiades 
 This life is more than just a read throughSat on a cliff 
 Wondering what did I miss 
 I watch the waves come in 
 Roll in roll out 
 Without a single doubt 
 Love on a bluff 
 Is there ever enough 
 I stare into the air 
 Somewhere out there 
 The family affair 
 Bring home the night 
 Hey I know that you turned on the light 
 Hey so slow but you gave me 
 The love of my life 
 Coming up short 
 And Im sad to report 
 We fuss and fight tonight 
 Your case my case 
 Another day to waste 
 Lovers dont mix 
 When they cant even fix 
 A plot that has a twist 
 To share my prayer 
 I need my baby bear 
 Come home tonight 
 Hey hey hey I know 
 That I waited so long 
 Hey hey hey so slow 
 But you gave me the love of my life 
 Oh she gave me the love of my life 
 Tell her Flea go aheadI like pleasure spiked with pain 
 And music is my aeroplane 
 Its my aeroplane 
 Songbird sweet and sour Jane 
 Pleasure spiked with pain 
 That motherfuckers always spiked with pain 
 Looking in my own eyes hey Lord 
 I cant find the love I want 
 Someone better slap me 
 Before I start to rust 
 Before I start to decompose 
 Looking in my rear view mirror 
 I can make it disappear 
 I can make it disappear Have no fear 
 I like pleasure spiked with pain 
 Sitting in my kitchen hey girl 
 Im turning into dust again 
 My melancholy baby 
 The star of Mazzy must 
 Push her voice inside of me 
 Im overcoming gravity 
 Its easy when youre sad to be 
 Its easy when youre sad sad like me 
 Just one note 
 Could make me float 
 Could make me float away 
 One note from 
 The song she wrote 
 Could fuck me where I lay 
 Could make me choke 
 One note thats not a lie 
 Could cut my throat 
 One note could make me die 
 Thats spiked with pain 
 Its my aeroplaneCatholic school girls rule 
 In the class shes taking notes 
 Just how deep deep is my throat 
 Mother Mary dont you know 
 Shes got eyes like Marilyn Monroe 
 Catholic school girls rule 
 From the cross shes raised her head 
 This is what the sister said 
 Give no love until youre wed 
 Live no life until youre dead 
 The good book says we must suppress 
 The good book says we must confess 
 But who cares what the good book says 
 Cause now shes taking off her dress 
 Lead us into temptation 
 We are pure divine creation 
 Talkin about my generation 
 Injected with the seed of immaculation 
 CatholicI I I I I 
 I I I II I 
 Cry 
 I cry 
 I was born in a land 
 I dont think you understand 
 Goddamn 
 What I am 
 Im a native of this place 
 Please dont kick me in my face 
 My race 
 Has been disgraced 
 Wont somebody testify 
 Kick a hole right in the sky 
 Testify testify 
 Slap a liar in his eye 
 Johnny 
 Johnny Johnny 
 I I I I I 
 Wonder why 
 Oh why 
 Put us in your pumpkin shell 
 Where you keep us very well 
 Its hell 
 Where I dwell 
 When history books are full of shit 
 I become the anarchist 
 Im pissed 
 At this 
 What this country claims to be 
 Its a lie no place 
 I bleed 
 Decide 
 To defy 
 Kill my trust if you must 
 But in my blood there is the lust 
 For life 
 Apache blood is in my heart 
 Thrashing though me like a shark 
 Crashing 
 Though the dark 
 Johnny 
 Confide 
 What am I supposed to do 
 I feel like Im cut in two 
 Confused 
 By rules 
 Do these two cultures clash 
 Or am I living in the past 
 I ask 
 Please tell me fast 
 I 
 To what do I belong 
 And if I change will I be wrong 
 Be wrong 
 Thats wrong 
 I took my foot and kicked 
 A hole in the sky 
 I proceeded to plead 
 Oh fathers help me decide 
 A jagged flash of light 
 Struck me in the eye 
 I turned around and found 
 That I was still alive 
 Snakes rise high 
 From the purple black sky 
 The red cloud rains 
 And the black horse rides 
 Then it dawned on me 
 Like the morning sun 
 Im a part of two worlds 
 And the morning comes 
 Glowing embers tend 
 To remember when 
 The power that is peace 
 Was treated as a friend 
 I am a master of adaption 
 And Ive got to take action 
 Im a man 
 The animal manIm coming for ya cause 
 Cause I adore ya and 
 I like to get inside your mass production 
 This indecision has 
 Has got me cringing well 
 I cant resist the smell of your seduction 
 Did I let you know 
 Would you like to go 
 Unwrap the package without much persuasion 
 I wanna dance to everydays occasion 
 This I know Yeah this I know 
 Take me home well take me home 
 This I know were not alone 
 Take me home take me home 
 When we envision a lack of division and 
 The planet does another revolution 
 The day I blew on ya 
 You said I grew on ya 
 Turns out that we are all the one solution go 
 Im coming at you well 
 You are the cat too and 
 I like the sound of your articulations 
 Want to arouse her and 
 Maybe espouse her well 
 She showed me love without the stipulations 
 I wanna lean on ya 
 Get Jan and Dean on ya 
 Its time to sway a little mass perception 
 I like you cheeky well 
 So Mozambiquey and 
 I think the world could use a clear connection 
 This I know Hey this I know 
 Would you like to goLucy Rebar 
 Shes a friend of mine 
 Later shell go 
 Back and redefine the line 
 Its getting longer all the time 
 Drinkin sunshine 
 She likes the taste of it 
 She had a gold mine 
 But then she wasted it away 
 You should have seen her yesterday 
 Send along the way 
 Nothing stops the ache 
 Sugar daddy 
 Loves her madly 
 Cosma Shiva 
 Got off 
 Made you a believer

 Tender 
 Why do I believe you 
 Annie wants a baby now 
 Annie wants a baby any way she can 
 Missing pieces 
 Shes got a lot of em 
 Time decreases 
 I wish I thought of em before 
 Before its time 
 To close the store 
 Distillation 
 A lonely sycophant 
 Some liberation 
 The only seed 
 We ever plant 
 I wanna help you 
 But I cant 
 No no 
 Love er leave er 
 God off 
 Neon soldiers 
 Left her 
 Now youve gotten older 
 Its time to redesign the sign 
 Sings along the wayI called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now 
 Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow 
 She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone 
 Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from 
 I dont take these things so personal 
 Anymore anymore 
 I dont think its irreversible 
 Anymore 
 Somebody hooted and they hollered Can I buy a vowel 
 Dont let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel 
 And when its not as it appears to be the flagrant foul 
 Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl 
 I dont think that its so terrible 
 I dont think that its unbearable 
 Tell me now I know that it just wont stop 
 You will find your flow when you go robot 
 I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin 
 Robots dont care where Ive been 
 Youve got to choose it to use it so let me plug it in 
 Robots are my next of kin 
 Sometimes I feel like Im a sentimental trooper 
 She cried so hard you know she looked like Alice Cooper 
 I dont think that its so personal 
 Im kissing high and low our bodys like two dominoes 
 Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes 
 Lets turn this cosplay holiday what we obey 
 And now were welcoming each other to this cabaret 
 Robots are my next of kinEasily lets get carried away 
 Easily lets get married today 
 Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat 
 Everything must go 
 A lickin stick is thicker when you break it to show 
 The story of a woman on the morning of a war 
 Remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for 
 Calling calling for something in the air 
 Calling calling I know you must be there 
 Easily lets get caught in a wave 
 Easily we wont get caught in a cave 
 Shao Lins shaking for the sake of his soul 
 Looking mighty tired of all the thing that you own 
 I cant tell you who to idolize 
 You think its almost over but its only on the rise 
 Throw me to the wolves because theres order in the pack 
 Throw me to the sky because I know Im coming back 
 I dont want to be your little research monkey boy 
 The creature that I am is only going to destroy 
 EasilyI met a man in a rock and roll band 
 He said Wont you come with me 
 I let him know that I could not go 
 You see I get mine for free 
 We are all just soldiers 
 In this battlefield of life 
 One thing thats for certain 
 Is my burning appetite 
 Step inside the emotional ride 
 I could use some company 
 Illusionary is so damn scary 
 I call my best friend Flea 
 This Ticonderoga 
 Is an element that shines 
 Connected by the great unknown 
 Between us there are lines 
 Yes I told her that Im the older cat 
 Can I scratch your back all day 
 I would not have it any other way 
 Well means so much to me 
 Can you see the we 
 What are we ever gonna do 
 When all I want to be is next to you 
 I took a girl from the underworld 
 And I held her way too tight 
 When its all been said and done 
 She was not up for the fight 
 In this open field of time 
 Hoping to get with you 
 When you get right with your mind 
 Its my favorite so I savor it 
 I must report that life is short 
 So of your love Ill take ten quarts 
 Well theres no end to this 
 Dont pretend to miss 
 You and you would not repent 
 For sitting on my elephant 
 And am I crazy to join the lazy zoo 
 All these human butterflies 
 And cactus flowers swollen eyes 
 And I want the devils share 
 Of you I do declare 
 Again Im asking can I do 
 When all these animals 
 Want to be just like you 
 I met a girl with long black hair 
 And she opened up so wide 
 A daffodil growing in Brazil 
 And I picked her for my bride 
 In this epic loving flight 
 And no one that I know 
 Has ever really done it right 
 Done it right 
 Done it rightHey yeah 
 Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways 
 But we do it with compassion and dont believe in age 
 Travel round the world getting naked on the stage 
 Busting people out of their everyday cage 
 We like to think we make a sad man happy 
 And we like to make proud our mammy and pappy 
 Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul 
 Were the modern day braves with one strong hold 
 Through the world of song our boldness is exposed 
 Im talking bout my buddies  funk it up Fishbone 
 Hey yeah 
 Good good time boys 
 Make me feel good 
 Give me good times 
 Our devotion to emotion is more than evident 
 To the minds that are open its you we represent 
 We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent 
 One day the good time boys might just be president 
 Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space 
 Our swingings gonna shatter every stone cold face 
 Now you may not know the exact reason why 
 A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky 
 Making more than money more than money can buy 
 Stop and take a listen to the monsters try 
 Got me boning 
 Im gonna try try try try try 
 Shes a shes a shes a white girl 
 If you dont believe me you can ask John Doe 
 Cause his heart is made of glory his voice is made of gold 
 Hell tell you in a minute about the men he knows 
 Hell tell you bout a band called fIREHOSE 
 To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit 
 We play it out loud for everyone to hear it 
 Building up our brains with the supernatural powers 
 We take it from the trees and the mighty Watts Towers 
 Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours 
 Were the best of the west and the west is ours 
 Rock it to the bottom 
 Lets funk it to the bottom 
 Lets rock it to the bottom

 Double chins and bowling pins 
 Unholy Presbyterians 
 Land is full of medicine

 The tainted new librarian 
 Who fainted when she tucked you in

 On stoic gusts of Northern wind 
 Out on the farm well be 
 Swimming with the mother duck 
 Deep in the midden where 
 Life is my friend 
 Underwater violins

 A porcelain that comes in twins

 The cleavage of your pillow skin

 Still Im awfully glad I came 
 Resonating in the shape of things to come 
 Never waiting when I know theres only one 
 Messed it up but rest assured 
 No one ever thinks theyre cured 
 Just a minute while I reinvent myself 
 Make it up and then I take it off the shelf 
 Over the laws of light 
 Over the moon by midnight 
 Lets do it all this time 
 Everyone wishing well we go and 
 Everyone knows Anything goes and now 
 We are the Lotus kids 
 Oh better take note of this 
 For the story 
 The rising moon is on the shine 
 The blood of scorpios and nine 
 Like the fear thats in eyes of every doe 
 Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know 
 Is it safe inside your head 
 Songs to serenade the dead 
 All along I said I know no enemies 
 Mix it up until there are no pedigrees 
 Into the shadow show and 
 Enter the rolling tide 
 Over the ocean so wide 
 Everyone wishing well we goI used to shout across the room to you 
 And youd come dancing like a fool 
 Shuffle step you funky mother 
 Come to me all warm as covers

 For you see there is no other 
 Memory so sad and sweet

 Well ever fill the 
 The hole you left my man

 Just another colorcoded crime 
 Incision and a suture 
 You told my friend 
 We would get it on no matter when 
 A supercavitation 
 Lets go you show 
 Me something no one will ever know 
 A love hallucination 
 Another lonely superstar 
 To get away inside your car 
 Take it much too far 
 Surrender to the brave inside 
 A lover that another tried 
 Take it to my ride 
 You dont have to keep it if its mine 
 Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car 
 Another place maybe another time 
 Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried 
 Complete repeat 
 Sitting in your car and on your street 
 Lost in California 
 Let’s steal this wheel 
 Take a spin to find out how we feel 
 Just around the corner 
 Slow down for sound 
 Turn it up and no we cant be found 
 The body that we transcend 
 Asleep you weep 
 Find out that the trick is never cheap 
 A melancholy girlfriend 
 Thats right youre right 
 Drive the constellation 
 Its time youre fine 
 The song is Fascination 
 The lover that another tried 
 A MayDecember might not be so smart 
 Arrivals that we wish would not depart 
 Dont be late cause youre my savior 
 Make it great whatever stays 
 Golden Gate my rearranger 
 Hold my name inside your raysThis is the kitt I cant compare 
 A delicate new arrival 
 Check the commute I do declare 
 Lets sing a new revival 
 Chemical circus at the pub 
 Mentally shes departed 
 Cut me a check Ill cut your rug 
 Later well get bombarded 
 Cause everybody knows 
 The game is full of highs and lows 
 Like your mother said 
 Girl your father is dead 
 Everybody knows 
 That life is full of highs and lows 
 Is there always red 
 In your wedding bed 
 Officer please I just got there 
 Traveled from door to door 
 Havent you seen my girlfriends hair 
 What are we looking for 
 This is the kitt I cant compare 
 I think we have our bible 
 Take me to the shore 
 Show me what its for 
 The game is full of cons and pros 
 Girl your fathers dead 
 Everybody knowsOoh 
 Readymade readymade 
 Steady as the rhythm rolls 
 And this is how the story goes 
 I got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona 
 Were gonna rocket to Ramones in the city of Pomona 
 Oh readymade readymade 
 Uh And if I give to you my second sight 
 You got it 
 Uh And if I stay the course Ill stay the night 
 Come get it 
 Baby oughta celebrate 
 And now its time to deviate 
 I got a sister making babies with a black and decker blowtorch 
 We gonna flop it all night in the middle of her back porch 
 Yeah readymade readymade 
 Get me out to celebrate 
 Oh clean it up Johnny 
 Rocking for the sake of slade 
 Listen but dont be afraid 
 I got a brother making trouble  in the state of California 
 I wish I knew another way but Im gonna have to clone ya 
 Rock it for the circus slave 
 Come get itOne day while bathing in the sea 
 My talking dolphin spoke to me 
 He spoke to me in symphony 
 From freedoms peace beneath the sea 
 He looked to me eyes full of love 
 Said Yes we live behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 The sun goes up 
 And the sun gets down 
 But like the heart of the sun 
 My heart continues to pound 
 Now while I shower in the rain 
 I watch my dolphin swim away 
 The one who listens to the surf 
 Can feel the pulse beat of the earth 
 And like my dolphin swims so free 
 The sun does swim into the sea 
 An island flying through the sky 
 One day your son might ask you why 
 And if your son should be a girl 
 She too might ask you of this world 
 The sun shines sweet upon your beach 
 And yes my dolphin loves to teach 
 Behind the sunPersistant mystic faults my vision 
 Its like always this point of collision 
 Its raining in my cranium 
 My head feels like a stadium 
 3 pounds of grain 
 About to burst 
 Inside my 3 pound universe 
 These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind 
 Symbols Ive been given to express my goal 
 Always come up short 
 You know they just dont get that low 
 Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision 
 Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation 
 Cleaner than light 
 Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000 
 Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers 
 Of suffering succotash 
 Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation frustration 
 Alone in the constellation of alienation 
 Detached from empty conversation 
 I wait 
 I wait for the wave to breakHair so smooth black as coal 
 Aw baby the way you sway 
 You wear the dress so very blue 
 That you take my blues away 
 She comes and goes that I know 
 She cums at least once a day 
 I cant resist I kiss your lips 
 Youre my sexy Mexican maid 
 She comes 
 Let me please get on my knees 
 I come alone 
 When I wake up in the morning 
 She greets me where I lay 
 I look outside to find 
 Its a bright and sunny day 
 So serene she gives to me 
 My toast and marmalade 
 What more can I say 
 Shes my sexy Mexican maid 
 She puts me in a bubble bath 
 She tickles me and I laugh 
 She washes me until Im clean 
 Then she does a little sexy dance 
 Happy to feel my hand go slap 
 Upon her sexy ass 
 We make fun so very slow 
 Then we make it very fast 
 Oh let me pleaseOh mercy mercy mercy me 
 I look around I need another remedy 
 The I dont know is philosophy 
 Better yet Ill let you get ahead of me 
 Oh mercy mercy mercy me 
 Come around I need another enemy 
 Anyone could clearly see 
 A summer breeze is part of my anatomy 
 When its written in Britain 
 We get a little smitten 
 Like a kitten a cuddle is where Im benefitin 
 Any higher the fire would have to petrify her 
 Upon the wire the flayer is gonna satisfy her 
 My love is forever 
 My love it can feel this 
 My breathless defender 
 Step froward and steal this 
 Mercy mercy mercy me 
 Comin down I gotta catch the gravity 
 Even though we disagree 
 Give a kiss cause life could be the death of me 
 Acrobatic the static is getting to dramatic 
 Comin down with the system 
 Well get it systematic 
 Fascilitatin the maiden my love is circulating 
 Rejuvenating the fading but never dilating 
 Lovin on the color of an Emily 
 Easy as a guarantee 
 Better yet Ill show you what you wanna see 
 I want you to feel this 
 We aim to forever I want you to feel this 
 My gentle defender 
 Step froward and steal thisPTboat on the way to Havana 
 I used to make a living man 
 Pickin the banana 
 Now Im a guide for the CIA 
 Hooray for the USA 
 Baby baby make me a loco 
 Baby baby make me a mambo 
 Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show 
 First stop Havana au gogo 
 Hooray for HavanaPeople keep on learnin 
 Soldiers keep on warrin 
 World keep on turnin 
 Cause it wont be too long 
 Powers keep on lyin 
 While your people keep on dyin 
 Im so darn glad he let me try it again 
 Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
 Im so glad that I know more than I knew then 
 Gonna keep on tryin 
 Til I reach the highest ground 
 Teachers keep on teachin 
 Preachers keep on preachin 
 Oh no 
 Lovers keep on lovin 
 Believers keep on believin 
 Sleepers just stop sleepin 
 Cause it wont be too long 
 Im so glad that he let me try it again 
 Til I reach my highest ground 
 No ones gonna bring me down 
 Dont you let nobody bring you down 
 God is gonna show you higher ground 
 Hes the only friend you have aroundTheres a port on a western bay 
 And it serves a hundred ships a day 
 Lonely sailors pass the time away 
 And talk about their homes 
 And theres a girl in this harbor town 
 And she works layin whiskey down 
 They say Brandy fetch another round 
 She serves them whiskey and wine 
 The sailors say Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 What a good wife you would be such a fine girl 
 Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea 
 Doodaditdooda 
 Ditdoodaditdoodadit 
 Brandy wears a braided chain 
 Made of finest silver from the north of Spain 
 A locket that bears the name 
 Of the man that Brandy loves 
 He came on a summers day 
 Bringin gifts from far away 
 But he made it clear he couldnt stay 
 No harbor was his home 
 The sailor saidn Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 But my life my lover my lady is the sea 
 Yeah Brandy used to watch his eyes 
 When he told his sailor stories 
 She could feel the ocean foam rise 
 She saw its ragin glory 
 But he had always told the truth lord he was an honest man 
 And Brandy does her best to understand 
 At night when the bars close down 
 Brandy walks through a silent town 
 And loves a man whos not around 
 She still can hear him say 
 She hears him say Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl 
 But my life my lover my lady is the seaMagpies on fire 
 Making love like little wolves 
 Out on the porch 
 Can lead to medicine 
 Oh well Im game 
 For anything at all 
 Scarecrows a liar 
 Spins a yarn and no one 
 Ever checked it out 
 To see if it was real 
 Sold you the moon 
 Now its time to fall 
 All along 
 Its like a bird 
 Whos trapped alone 
 Inside your cage love 
 What more do you want 
 How much more can you take 
 I love my mistakes 
 Ive been here before 
 All and all 
 Its just the call 
 Of something wild 
 Beyond your room 
 Theres a changing 
 Of the major chord 
 Your minor threat 
 Will do love 
 My gun misfired 
 Shot myself instead 
 I guess I always knew 
 Id be the one to lose 
 That screen door slams 
 Time to make a move 
 All in all its like the bird trapped alone inside the cage love 
 A bird whos born 
 To live at half your age girl 
 A bird whos 
 Never really had a say 
 Least of all 
 Shes like a bird 
 Whos now been freed 
 From someones cageWhat ever never knew 
 That I could feel so good 
 Smile in your eyes 
 What ever never knew 
 That I could walk through wood 
 I guess I never tried 
 A million years old 
 But just a little girl 
 Vibin off the gong 
 Rubbin on the bowls 
 Make you float around 
 Make your lovin strong 
 And when we get 
 In the same place 
 At the same time 
 It is your grace 
 That I want to 
 Fall right into now 
 To love avow 
 Im falling into grace with you 
 Im falling into guru muhk 
 She moves in a rapture 
 That her capsule might

 The the twostep goes from intuition that is my liquid fare 
 We are all in favor of the opening

 Truth be told we let the good times roll 
 Receive it and believe it 
 And its moaning and creating love 
 Tender titilations 
 Im a fish and I can swim all day 
 I can swim in so many ways

 Or any of a hundred styles 
 Its not about the smile you wear but 
 The way we make out 
 When I was an allaloner 
 Nothing but a two beach comber 
 Anybody seen the sky 
 Im wide awake now 
 Working the beat as we speak 
 Working the belle du monde 
 Believe in the havoc we wreak 
 Believing  Is that so wrong Can I get my codependent 
 Come on 
 Must have been a hundred miles 
 Any of a hundred styles 
 Gonna get ya 
 Listen to me what I said 
 And try to get it through your head 
 A little bit of circumstance and 
 A chance to make out 
 Living in a citadel 
 Its hard enough to be yourself 
 Waiting for the bell to toll and 
 Im wide awake nowCabron cabron 
 Cabron cabron

 Youre always wearing Dodger blue 
 Mad doggin me and 
 Anyone from any other crew 
 I am small but I am strong

 What else can I do 
 Everyone would take a cue 
 From anything you do 
 If you want them to 
 What else can they do 
 I dont want to fight 
 I want to get along with you 
 This time of nights for singin 
 Songs about the local news 
 Ill come around and make peace 
 Get down have a barbecue 
 Lets keep the moon awake 
 And do electric boogaloo 
 You see Im just like you 
 If you only knew 
 That Im just like you 
 All the world would 
 Take a cue from anything you do 
 That theyre just like you 
 What else can I do 
 Cause Im just like you

 She told me too 
 And show me what to do 
 Our Maggie makes it in a cloud 
 I said hey now 
 We gotta make it rain somehow 
 She told me to 
 And showed me what to do 
 She knows how to make it loud 
 Rain dance Maggie 
 Advances to the final 
 Who knew that she had the goods 
 Little did I know her body 
 Was warm delicious vinyl 
 To your neck of the woods 
 I want to lick a little bit 
 Hey now

 Bye bye bye girl 
 Bye bye bye girlJaney 
 You are my 
 Victorian machinery 
 Breath yourself to life 
 Later 
 Your tender shape 
 Is bending like the scenery 
 Ride you like a bike 
 You be the sail 
 And baby Ill be the rudder 
 We could make it all day 
 Until it turns into butter 
 I saw your face 
 A seminal pleasure 
 I will love you forever 
 When I heeded your call 
 And every heavy endeavor 
 Ill keep your place 
 Janey 
 Coming down 
 The mountain like a buffalo 
 Seeds deep in your eyes 
 Crazy 
 But then again 
 A girl could like it rough you know 
 Makes up for her size 
 When I saw your all today 
 You be the shack 
 And baby Ill be the desert 
 There is nothing to lack 
 When there is nothing to measure 
 Its all space 
 You are my victorian machinery 
 Nah nah nah nah nah 
 Jaded 
 Make a fist and knock me on the mood again 
 Leave yourself to lie 
 Make me feel like I want more than you again 
 Rock me like the vibe 
 Sing along just like they do in Budapest 
 On the rise 
 Its all all spaceI got dosed by you and 
 Closer than most to you and 
 What am I sposed to do 
 Take it away I never had it anyway 
 Take it away and everything will be okay 
 In you a star is born and 
 You cut a perfect form and 
 Someone forever warm 
 Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on 
 Way up on the mountain where she died 
 All I ever wanted was your life 
 Deep inside the canyon I cant hide 
 Show love with no remorse and 
 Climb onto your sea horse and 
 This ride is right on course 
 This is the way I wanted it to be with you 
 This is the way I knew that it would be with you 
 I got dosed by you and 
 Take it away and everything will be ok 
 All I ever wanted was your lifeGive it up to this planet full of strife 
 Were the brothers cup cuttin sharp as a knife 
 With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap 
 The cups went up like a natural fact 
 It was our shoulder space 
 That made the perfect place 
 For the magic of the cup 
 To style out with grace 
 With a tight turn twist 
 And a slight swerve swank 
 The brothers cup kissed 
 With a kick ass clank 
 We are the brothers cup 
 We like to get it up 
 Give it up to this planet full of strife 
 So love all your brothers 
 And love all your sisters 
 Love all the misses 
 And love all the misters 
 Dont be shy when youre sharin your kisses 
 The brothers cup kiss 
 And we aint sissies 
 It is our notion that the perfect peace potion 
 Can be found in the wake of the green seas motion 
 The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean 
 Is the cradle of peace its the perfect peace motion 
 With the power of the cup we are about to astound 
 All your preconceptions they will come unbound 
 We are the brothers cup coming to your town 
 Bringing tubs of love were going to spread it aroundIm an ocean 
 In your bedroom 
 Make you feel warm make you want to reassume 
 Now we know it all for sure 
 Im a dance hall 
 Dirty breakbeat 
 Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet 
 Not alone Ill be there 
 Tell me when you want to go 
 Im a meth lab 
 First rehab 
 Take it all off and step inside the running cab 
 Theres a love that knows the way 
 Im the rainbow 
 In your jail cell 
 All the memories of everything youve ever smelled 
 Not alone 
 Ill be there tell me when you wanna go 
 So sideways falling 
 More will be revealed my friend 
 Sideways falling Dont forget me I cant hide it 
 More will be revealed my friend Come again get me excited 
 Im an inbred 
 And a pothead 
 Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed 
 I could show you 
 To the free field 
 Overcome and more will always be revealed 
 More will be revealed my friend 
 Theres a match now let me light it 
 Im the bloodstain 
 On your shirt sleeve 
 Coming down and more are coming to believe 
 Make the hair stand 
 Up on your arm 
 Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm 
 Come again and tell me when you wanna go 
 More will be revealed my friendSitting on a sack of beans 
 Sitting down in New Orleans 
 You wouldnt believe what Ive seen 
 Sitting on that sack of beans 
 Lunatics on pogo sticks 
 Another southern fried freak on a crucifix 
 Hicks dont mix with politics 
 People on the street just kicking to the licks 
 Yes my favorite place to be 
 Is not a land called Honalee 
 Mentally or physically 
 I wanna be in New Orleans 
 Oh good brother just when I thought 
 That I had seen it all 
 My eyes popped out my dick got hard 
 And I dropped my jaw 
 I saw a bird walking down the block 
 Name Apache Rose Peacock 
 I could not speak I was in shock 
 I told my knees to please not knock 
 A little boy came along 
 Name of Louis Armstrong 
 Said that girl who left me silly 
 She liked the looks of me and my willy 
 So I found her in the quarter 
 Good God how I adored her 
 Oh she made me feel so cozy 
 When she told me I could call her Rosey 
 I kiss your hair your skin so bare 
 Ill take you with me girl anywhere 
 You fare well in stormy weather 
 I never met a girl that I like better 
 Twinkle twinkle little star 
 Shining down on my blue car 
 Driving down the boulevard 
 She was soft and I was hard 
 Apache Rose gotta rocking peacock 
 Hottest ass on the goddamn block 
 Rocking to the beat of the funkyass Meters 
 She has one of those builtin heaters 
 Voodoo gurus casting their spells 
 Cockatoo drag queens shaking their bells 
 Silver sound escapes the trumpet 
 Watch your leg someone might hump it 
 Chicken strut your butt lets rock 
 Getting it on under your frock 
 Flowing like a flame all through the night 
 My girls insane but its all right 
 I wanna be in New OrleansWoop woop Ha 
 Junior pimp at the old café 
 Got to chase those girls around 
 Westbound drunk with lots to say 
 But he never makes a sound 
 Hustlers get what they deserve 
 But its always half the gate 
 Good things come to those who wait 
 Like an expiration date 
 See you around Ill see you around 
 Ill play all night cant get uptight 
 Ill lead all your mind games astray 
 When I see you around Ill see you around 
 See you so long goodbye hooray 
 Awww 
 Curb your tongue oh scallywag 
 Because you got no flag to wave 
 Save your breath for the black and white 
 Every dog will have its day 
 When I see you around Ill see you around 
 Aw yeah 
 Ill see you around Ill see you around 
 Well Ill see you around Ill see you around 
 Ill see you around 
 Goodbye and hooray 
 When I see you around Ill see you around oh nah nah nah noMe and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friends 
 Me and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friends 
 Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod well 
 Thats my friend and my friendss named Bob 
 Like the devil knows hell I know Bobby well 
 Well enough to tell you bout his sixtyseven smells 
 Well enough to tell you hes a hella swella fella 
 Well enough to tell you that we know each other better than we know our selves 
 Like freaks of a feather we rock together 
 I know Bobby well but I think he knows me better 
 Hes as close to me as a friend can be 
 Well Ill be standing by my buddy hell be standing by me 
 Just another half of the twoheaded freak 
 But I need him like my heart needs to beat 
 At this point in this friendly verse 
 Ive gotta sing a little something that I havent rehearsed 
 Its about my man and his name is Hillel 
 For whom my love is soulbrother sacred 
 Take it Huckleberry 
 Slim boy take it 
 Jackys eyes are closed but hes right on course 
 Because hes guided by the invisible force 
 He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybodys Porsche 
 Hes a working class drummer hes as strong as a horse 
 Me and my me and my me and my me and my me and my friendsOh yeah yeah woah yeah 
 Arthur J did indicate 
 The boulevard would never be 
 So full of love and life again ay 
 Hot as Hades early eighties 
 Sing another song and make me 
 Feel like Im in love again ay 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh please dont strip my mind 
 Leave something behind 
 Please dont strip my mind 
 Oh yeah yeah woah yeah 
 All in favor sign the waiver 
 Bloody Carolina wont you 
 Take another look inside ay 
 Operator cocreator 
 Come on radiator wont you 
 Blow another top and sing ay 
 El Dorado won the lotto 
 All that cash and not a clue 
 But now you know what Ive been through ay 
 Please dont strip my mindStep right up and listen please 
 Youre gonna get it with the greatest of ease 
 Well everybody gather round 
 All aboard the underground 
 Youve got to get in before you get out 
 And getting out is what its gonna be about 
 If you find that you are blind 
 Open your bashful mind 
 Let my band step inside 
 And take you on a cosmic ride 
 With honest sounds Ill paint your brain 
 For in this song I do proclaim 
 That once aboard this moving train 
 Ill do my best to ease your pain 
 Slinky as my speech may be 
 On this trip youll ride for free 
 As we leave our trailer spots 
 Well outer space is lots of dots 
 This axis bold as love you see 
 Comes and goes too easily 
 Space is king or so I sing 
 Subway to Venus 
 Once aboard and feeling smooth 
 Like a liquid you will ooze 
 Into a state of mind that soothes 
 Aw be my quest inside my groove 
 Cause what Ive got to give to you 
 Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu 
 Ill make you wiggle like a wiggly worm 
 Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm 
 Lifes too short to be in a hole 
 So bust into your funkiest stroll 
 Is gonna make you wanna boogalooluau 
 Take your body shake it around 
 Do the dog on the ground 
 And if I cant make you dance 
 I guess Ill just have to make you piss your pants 
 Subway to VenusSay what you need to say 
 Make it clear 
 Make it great 
 Cause its not too late 
 And theres no mistake 
 When you shine 
 Shake it for me anyway 
 Now we crash the gate 
 To investigate 
 Your fate 
 Pleasure to meet you 
 Got so much more 
 To offer the world 
 See whats in store 
 Stay all day 
 Someone to love 
 Thats my boy chip chop 
 Open the doors 
 And we never close shop 
 Take what you need to take 
 To forsake 
 Make it for me anyway 
 When we fill the void 
 That is Pink As Floyd 
 To destroy 
 Records that we file away 
 And Ill clean the slate 
 As I calculate 
 And you shine as you redefine 
 Your time just another time of day 
 Do you feel the spark 
 When you play the part 
 Superstar 
 Fake it for me anyway 
 Time to tell them all 
 Without hem or haw 
 No applause 
 Tell them how to generate 
 How to raise the bar 
 How to keep it hard 
 To be alive make it for me anyway 
 If you care at all 
 You will bare it all 
 You will grind shake it for me anyway 
 Born to play the part 
 Dying for your art 
 Cause its time 
 Take it for me anyway 
 You will clear the air 
 With a single stare 
 Your fateGive it up to this time full of strife 
 Get down you might be fucking with the song of life 
 Extend your deeper senses there will be no fight 
 At the never ending ocean of perfect insights 
 Round your molecule beam with a halo of light 
 The animated aura will give delight 
 Soon your every single worry will be out of sight 
 With the power of It we are about to astound 
 All your preconceptions they will come unbound 
 Listen very close my inner voice expounds 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sound 
 Yes we deliver the truth to our musical birth 
 A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth 
 People have to know that its not about money 
 Cash is not the way to make your life sunny 
 There is no need if you got the soul seed 
 Love life and peace it can only begin 
 When you know in your heart that the change is within 
 Love all your brothers and love all your sisters 
 Love all the missus and love all the misses 
 And dont be shy when youre sharing your kisses 
 Greed jealousy gets boos and hisses 
 What it is what it is so much to be found 
 What it is what it is groove down to the sounds 
 What it is what it is what it is in a song 
 What it is what it is you can do no wrong 
 Balance your life with the right kind of foods 
 To eat a sad cow is to eat another you 
 Well thats an unfair rap its unforgivably rude 
 Itll put your karma in the worst of moods 
 Someones drinking booze and taking too many ludes 
 Cause when you cop dont you cop an attitude 
 And thats an ugly thing its not the real you 
 So please yall take some sound advice 
 Be yourself clear your mind make a sacrifice 
 The always sober you is especially nice 
 Dont loot dont shout give comet the boot 
 I love it kickin back and playin my bamboo flute 
 Refuse to fight wars for political whores 
 Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores 
 It is my notion that the perfect peace potion 
 Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean 
 The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean 
 Is the cradle of peace its the perfect peace potion 
 There you will find it with sweet sea creatures 
 The smile of a dolphin is a builtin feature 
 We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher 
 Good morning class how very nice to meet you 
 Open up your hearts to the planets to the stars 
 With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars 
 You know Einstein did while Hitler hid 
 Now Albert lives forever in every single kid 
 But with Adolph Hitler we are permanently rid 
 Picasso Mister Dali and my man Jimi Hendrix 
 These cool brothers make the world go round 
 Yeah they do it with art and Jimi did it with sound 
 But by all these men it was found 
 Each and every person can be just as renowned 
 Dont let the worlds racist creeds give your pretty face a frown 
 Stand up for equal rights I mean buckle down 
 Go spread the word from town to town 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sounds 
 Now that youve heard what it is in a song 
 From here on in you can do no wrongspoken 
 Could you turn up the track a little bit please 
 sung 
 My mouth fell open 
 Hoping that the truth would not be true 
 Refuse the news 
 Im feeling sick now 
 What the fuck am I supposed to do 
 Just lose and lose 
 First time I saw you 
 You were sitting backstage in a dress 
 A perfect mess 
 You never knew this 
 But I wanted badly for you to 
 Requite my love 
 Left on the floor 
 Leaving your body 
 When highs are the lows 
 And lows are the way 
 So hard to stay 
 Guess now you know 
 I love you so 
 I liked your whiskers 
 And I liked the dimple in your chin 
 Your pale blue eyes 
 You painted pictures 
 Cause the one who hurts can give so much 
 You gave me such 
 I love you soWaking up dead inside of my head 
 Will never never do there is no med 
 No medicine to take 
 Ive had a chance to be insane 
 Asylum from the falling rain 
 Ive had a chance to break 
 Its so bad its got to be good 
 Mysterious girl misunderstood 
 Dressed like a wedding cake 
 Any other day and I might play 
 A funeral march for Bonnie Brae 
 Why try and run away 
 Slow cheetah come before for my forest 
 Looks like its on today 
 Slow cheetah come its so euphoric 
 No matter what they say 
 I know a girl she worked in a store 
 She knew not what her life was for 
 She barely knew her name 
 They tried to tell her she would never be 
 As happy as a girl in a magazine 
 She bought it with her pay 
 Everyone has so much to say 
 They talk talk talk their lives away 
 Dont even hesitate 
 Walking on down to the burial ground 
 Its a very old dance with a merry old sound 
 No matter what they sayBlood sugar suckerfish in my dish 
 How many pieces do you wish 
 Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side 
 Girl please me be my soul bride 
 Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite 
 Copulate to create a state of sexual light 
 Kissing her virginity my affinity 
 I mingle with the gods I mingle with divinity 
 Blood sugar baby 
 Shes magik sex magik sex magik 
 Blood sugar crazy 
 She has it sex magik sex magik 
 Glorious euphoria is my must 
 Erotic shock is a function of lust 
 Temporarily blind dimension to discover 
 In time each into the other 
 Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat 
 Fill a space in which two bodies float 
 Operatic by voice a fanatic by choice 
 Aromatic is the flower she must be moist 
 She magik sex magik sex magik 
 Blood sugar my girl 
 She magik sex magik sex magikSmile 
 When Im shy in ways 
 But I love 
 Everything of first impressions 
 Sweet successions 
 Been around for quite a while 
 I see you kept it versatile 
 Motivated to combine 
 Even when its bad its fine 
 Did she say something 
 That made you cry 
 Have you lost it all 
 The big fall 
 Oh so slowly 
 Comes back holy 
 Bishop takes a knight 
 But I will put up quite a fight 
 Here is your ham on rye 
 Elementary the chemistry 
 Means everything to me 
 The long progressions why 
 Set it off to collect knowledge 
 Quit a job 
 And go to college 
 All about the aftershock 
 Swedish Latin super funk 
 Moses of Manhattan 
 Made it great 
 Pain we celebrate 
 And I love 
 The long progression indiscretion 
 Heres your ham on rye 
 Elementary the chemistry means everything to me 
 In between the reasons 
 Are the psychedelic seasons 
 Simple as your stride 
 Information intimated 
 Elegant and integrated 
 Sweet your floors with pride 
 Smile 
 Cause its all a ride 
 All supplied 
 Everything about this session 
 And this long progression 
 Long progressions why 
 Long progressions whyI am just a lousy burn 
 Searching for the unknown crumb 
 The crumb the crumb 
 Nothing or someone to come 
 Come along illuminate my lust 
 Combust 
 Confucius might have been confused 
 And Buddha might have blown a fuse 
 I ooze 
 The muse 
 Meet me at the coffee shop 
 We can dance like Iggy Pop 
 Another go in the parking lot 
 Freak the cheek on your hotspot 
 Back and forth my bodys jerking 
 Will to thrill will not stop working 
 Work and work 
 Ill take you on a honeymoon 
 Jumping on a bed in a hotel room 
 The room 
 The groom 
 Freak the cheek on your hotspotLets make evil 
 Lets make good 
 Id do anything I could 
 Just to get you in my dirty wood 
 Go down on you 
 Seventeen and thirtyone 
 I am just my mothers son 
 Brown eyes and a silver tongue 
 All the mothers come undone 
 At the sight of me 
 The waters falling clear 
 Interiors deceive I fear 
 I think Ill kiss my shame away 
 My prudence is not dear 
 Inside out and feeling weird 
 Lets get soft 
 Lets get hard 
 Lets get off in my backyard 
 Where the desert wind 
 Will wash our skin 
 A lighter red 
 Lets make peace 
 Lets make war 
 Lets break into heaven for 
 A dance with heavens devils or 
 Is that more than you can store 
 Inside your head 
 I dont want to live alone 
 Get on my throne 
 Slay my shame 
 Lets get gentle 
 Lets get pissed 
 Get your knickers in a twist 
 Cause the angel and the devil kiss 
 They fell in love 
 Some seem dirty 
 Some stay clean 
 Something from a madmans dream 
 Am I really what I seem 
 Rising to my head like cream 
 It feels so strange 
 Slay my shameAll around the world 
 We could make time 
 Rompin and astompin 
 Cause Im in my prime 
 Born in the north 
 And sworn to entertain ya 
 Cause Im down for 
 The state of 
 Pennsylvania 
 I try not to whine but 
 I must warn ya 
 Bout the motherfuckin 
 Girls from 
 California 
 Alabama

 Hallelujah 
 Good god girl

 That life is beautiful around the world 
 I know I know its you 
 You say hello and then I say I do 
 Come back baby 
 Cause Id like to say

 Back from 
 Bombay 
 Fox hole love 
 Pie in your face 
 Living in and out 
 Of a big fat suitcase 
 Bonafide ride 
 Step aside my Johnson 
 Yes I could 
 In the woods of 
 Wisconsin 
 Wake up the cake 
 Its a lake shes kissin me 
 As they do when 
 They do in 
 Sicily 
 I know I know for sure 
 I know I know its you 
 Where you want to go 
 Who you want to be

 And I have seen your love 
 You say hello and then I say I doOn a far away island 
 Of Salamasond 
 Yertle the turtle 
 Was king of the pond 
 A nice little pond 
 It was clean it was neat 
 The water was warm 
 There was plenty to eat 
 Until one day 
 The king of them all 
 Decided the kingdom 
 He ruled was too small 
 Im a ruler of all that I see 
 But I dont see enough 
 And thats the trouble with me 
 With this stone for a throne 
 I am too low down 
 I cannot look down 
 Upon the places beyond 
 So Yertle the turtle king 
 Lifted his hand 
 And Yertle the turtle king 
 He ordered all the turtles 
 Onto one anothers back 
 He piled them high 
 Into a ten turtle stack 
 Im Yertle the turtle 
 The things I now rule 
 Im king of a cow 
 Im king of a mule 
 Then down from below 
 In the great turtle stack 
 Came a burp from a plain 
 Little turtle named Mack 
 Just part of the throne 
 This burpin little turtle 
 Looked up and said I beg 
 Your pardon king Yertle 
 Ive pains in my back 
 My shoulders and my knees 
 How long must we stand 
 Here your majesty 
 Silence the king of the 
 Turtles barked back 
 To the bad burpin 
 Oh marvelous me for 
 I am ruler of all that I see 
 Yertle Yertle the turtle 
 Yertle Yertle the turtleStranded 
 Stranded 
 Stranded on the toilet bowl 
 What do you do when youre stranded 
 And there aint nothing on the roll 
 To prove youre a man 
 You must wipe it with your hand 
 Stranded on the toilet bowlIve got a mellowship Ive got a fellowship 
 Ive got a nonstop Yo swan hello chip 
 Born to adore the big bad bison 
 Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson 
 Popcorn peanuts looking at big butts 
 No I cannot keep my mouth shut 
 Rocking to the beat of the fabulous Forum 
 My Lakers I adore em 
 Blush my lady when I tell her 
 That I do indeed love to smell her 
 Sopping wet your pink umbrella 
 Do the dog with Isabella 
 Im so in love yes with an artist 
 Imagination hes the smartest 
 Robert Williams stroke and splatter 
 I attest to your gray matter 
 Living kings how true it rings 
 These are just a few of my favorite things 
 Good God wheres my sleigh now 
 Good God playing for days now 
 Good God well any day now 
 Good God take me away now 
 Good God the purple haze now 
 Good God the baddest of brains now 
 Good God riding my sleigh now 
 Being that Im the duke of my domain 
 My hat goes off to Mark Twain 
 Singing a song about what true men dont do 
 Killing another creature thats kind of blue 
 Writing about the world of the wild coyote 
 Good man Truman Capote 
 Talking about my thoughts cause they must grow 
 Cock my brain to shoot my load 
 Im on the porch cause I lost my house key 
 Pick up my book I read Bukowski 
 Can I get another kiss from you 
 Kiss me right here on my tattoo 
 Good God De Niros insane now 
 Good God racking my brain now 
 Good God take me away now take me away 
 Me my friends and the sex machine 
 Do unto others like my brother Bean 
 I know youve got a mother so give her a hug 
 I know youve got a mother with a whole lotta love 
 Billy sings and Basie swings 
 These are just a few HoI told you before stay away from my door 
 Dont give me that brother brother brother brother 
 The freaks on the phone wont leave me alone 
 So dont give me that brother brother brother brother

 I I found out 
 Now that I showed you what I been through 
 Dont take nobodys word what you can do 
 There aint no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
 Now that I found out I know I can cry 
 Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
 Dont get you nowhere dont make you a man 
 I heard something bout my Ma and my Pa 
 They didnt want me so they made me a star 
 Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
 Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
 Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
 There aint no guru who can see through your eyes 
 Ive seen through junkies Ive been through it all 
 I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
 Dont let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
 No one can harm you feel your own pain 
 I I found this out

 One big mob ah yeah ah yeah 
 Eh bara mala ah yeah ah yeah 
 One big mob is 
 Ooze into into my noodle 
 East or west shepherd or poddle 
 Lady bug pine tree 
 To mingle with the bumblebee 
 A lover to the Sun 
 And a brother to the cool breeze 
 We live in the city 
 We live in the jungle 
 Its time to be drinking 
 A thimble humble 
 Everything you ever see 
 Is never more than you and me 
 Give it on into the beauty of the mystery 
 One big mob is all 
 One big mob in one big home 
 A broken home 
 Id like to share some air with you 
 Some air with you 
 A morning forest full of truths 
 The green is blue 
 The head thats getting pregnant lives 
 To give and give 
 What was I thinking in my head 
 The color red 
 Breaking hearts instead of bread 
 Something I said 
 Checkmated by frustration now 
 Need to be cut loose 
 A different kind of being lost 
 A sullen cost 
 Scrawled upon the wall 
 Of a bathroom stall 
 A stranger wrote a note 
 That spoke to all 
 One two 
 Buckle my shoe 
 Take care of me 
 Cause I might be you 
 Picaboo Street in Timbuktu 
 Do I need repeat 
 That a boy named Sue 
 Rockin to the beat 
 Of the kangaroo 
 Let me kiss your feet 
 And your forehead too 
 One big mob isCan I get your hand to write on 
 Just a piece of leg to bite on 
 What a night to fly my kite on 
 Do you want to flash your light on 
 Take a look its on display for you 
 Coming down No not today 
 Did you meet your fortune teller 
 Get it off with no propeller 
 Do it up its on with Stella 
 What a way to finally smell her 
 Picking up but not too strong for you 
 Take a piece and pass it on 
 Fly away on my Zephyr 
 I feel it more than ever 
 And in this perfect weather 
 Well find a place together 
 Fly on my wind 
 Rebel and a liberator 
 Find a way to be a skater 
 Rev it up to levitate her 
 Superfriendly aviator 
 In the water where I center my emotion 
 All the world can pass me by 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Do you 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Wont you 
 Were gonna live forever 
 ForeverSo we were down in Brazil and man that place is wild 
 We were in Rio de Janeiro and uh we had this this sort of uh 
 Securityguard type guy and he was supposed to take us around and say hey 
 Could you know could you take us to the 
 The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the 
 You know the street life of your town and he said sure so we we pull up to this hooker 
 And shes wearing some kind of a a bright green miniskirt and it turns out its a transsexual 
 And he says Get over here and she comes over and she thinks shes busted but shes not busted 
 Naw shes not busted he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say Hey whats up girl 
 I get out of bed 
 And I clear up my head 
 I dont want to go 
 But I do it instead 
 We are dreams 
 Within a dream 
 I get into bed 
 And I turn off my head 
 I started to float 
 Was it something she said 
 So I remember we got our drivers license and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson painted green and 
 Hollywood would get so crazy in the winterthe rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights 
 And well you know we smoked weed and wed go up in the hills and wed listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and 
 Well we would dream you know we would dream and we would talk about what we wanted to do and we would talk about girls and music 
 And you know Hillel wanted to be a rock starI didnt even know what that was I was like whatever you wanna do man Im coming with you 
 Im right with you my friend 
 Why in the world would you want it to be why would you wanna take it so so literally 
 All these things that come down from the sky raining upon your head make you stop and wonder why ah 
 Cant they just spell it out make it clear make it easy to read for the simple man like me 
 I dont think so 
 I reach out to my family and I say 
 Its not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky 
 With a punishing hand oh 
 Its about heaven in your heart

 Ive seen it all through someone else and I 
 Celebrated but undisturbed 
 Serenaded by the terror bird 
 Its seldom seen and its never heard oh 
 Never in the wrong time or wrong place 
 Desecration is the smile on my face 
 The love I made is the shape of my space 
 My face my face 
 Disintegrated by the rising sun 
 A rolling black out of oblivion and Id 
 Like to think that Im your number one oh 
 Rolling black out of oblivion 
 I wanna leave but I just get stuck 
 A broken record running low on luck 
 Theres heavy metal coming from your truck and I 
 Broken record running low on luck 
 We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise 
 Coca Cola doesnt do the justice she enjoys 
 We could all come up with something new to be destroyed 
 We could all go down 
 I love the feeling when it falls apart 
 Im slow to finish but Im quick to start and 
 Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark and Im 
 Slow to finish but I am quick to start

 Do you want me girl to be your thief 
 Oh baby just for you

 Give to me sweet sacred bliss 
 That mouth was made to 
 Your mouth was made to suck my kissSwing 
 Ive got a soul that cannot sleep 
 At night when something just aint right yo 
 Blood red but without sight 
 Exploding egos in the night 
 Mix like sticks of dynamite 
 Red black or white this is my fight 
 Come on courage lets be heard 
 Turn feelings into words 
 American equality has always been sour 
 An attitude I would like to devour 
 My name is peace this is my hour 
 Can I get just a little bit of power 
 The power of equality 
 Is not yet what it ought to be 
 ought to be 
 It fills me up like a hollow tree 
 hollow tree 
 Right or wrong my song is strong 
 You dont like it get along 
 Say what I want do what I can 
 Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan 
 I dont buy supremacy 
 A media chief you menace me 
 The people you say cause all the crime 
 Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime 
 Blackest anger whitest fear 
 Can you hear me Am I clear 
 Ive got tapes Ive got CDs 
 Ive got my 
 Public Enemy 
 My lilywhite ass is tickled pink 
 When I listen to the music that makes me think 
 Not another motherfucking politician 
 Doing nothing but something for his own ambition 
 Never touch the sound we make 
 Soulsacred love vows that we take 
 To create straight what is true 
 Yo hes with me and what I do 
 Madder than a motherfucker lick my finger 
 Cant forget cause the memory lingers 
 Count em off quick little piccadilly sickness 
 Take me to the hick oh eat my thickness 
 Ive got a welt from the Bible belt 
 Dealing with the hand that Ive been dealt 
 Sitting in the grip of a killing fist 
 Giving up blood just to exist 
 Rub me wrong and I get pissed 
 No I cannot get to this 
 People in pain I do not dig it 
 Change of brain for Mr Bigot 
 Little brother do you hear me 
 Have a heart oh come get near me 
 Misery is not my friend 
 But Ill break before I bend 
 What I see is insanity 
 Whatever happened to humanity 
 Whatever happened to humanityWell Im walking on down the road 
 But it cant be heaven 
 Cause the streets arent gold 
 And everybody knows what Bobby D was told 
 Im walkin on down the road 
 Groovin a tune straight out of the womb 
 Cause trust is a must to be a true blue dude 
 Thats a matter of fact dont be confused 
 Everybody knows true friends are few 
 Everybody come in everybody sing sing my song 
 Everybody knows everybody thinks that Ive done wrong 
 Well Im walking on down the road 
 And Im walkin on down the road 
 Like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs 
 A dude he cant lose when he lives on love 
 Like the bark on a tree 
 Like the skin on my knees 
 Im standin by my blood 
 Im walkin on down the roadIm afraid that Im never afraid 
 Ive got combat boots 
 And Im American made 
 For your eyes girl 
 Mormon lover on a delicate day 
 Gonna marry the boss 
 Get carried away 
 War cries girl 
 Im not immune to Canadian snow 
 Now teach me everything 
 That I should know 
 Your eyes girl 
 Freeze on the radio 
 Ive got to leave and more 
 Ive got to bleed into snow 
 Hold on 
 Let go 
 We know 
 Do you shine like a temple inside 
 Can I open your core 
 So gentle and wide 
 Like your eyes girl 
 Rack em up stretch em out 
 When theyre tight 
 This acetylene torch is giving me sight 
 Ive got to leave and alone 
 Black and blue from the hullabaloo 
 Do the caribou bite 
 When they look into you 
 And your eyes girl 
 We knowFind me in the suburbs 
 And the shadow of decay 
 Rolling rings of rubber 
 And the band begins to play 
 Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain 
 Can you see the rising of old yesterdays remains 
 Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest 
 Time dont stand a chance against this motor madness 
 Dont you worry baby 
 Im like Detroit Im crazy 
 Dont you worry baby Im like 
 The Stooges and J Dilla yeah 
 They tore this town apart 
 Put me back together well 
 I guess thats quite an art hit me 
 Henry won the war you see but not with pen or sword 
 He did it with the little thing I think its called a Ford 
 Everythings so hazy 
 Everythings so hazy ahhhWont somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive 
 To survive 
 Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes 
 Take away the tourniquet 
 I used to be so full of my confidence 
 I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go 
 More than ever I could use a coincidence 
 But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know 
 Hey ah yeah how long 
 I guess I ought to walk away 
 Hey ah yeah so long 
 What you gonna do today 
 I dont wanna have to but I will 
 If thats what Im supposed to do 
 We dont wanna set up for the kill 
 But thats what Im about to do 
 Later on Ill cut you off when youre screaming into the phone 
 Hard to own 
 Anyway I wanna let you know that everything is on hold 
 What you gonna do to me 
 You used to be so warm and affectionate 
 All the little things I used to hear my fairy say 
 But now youre quick to give in to your regret 
 Ill take the fall and now you gotta give it all away 
 Hey what would you say if I stayed 
 Stay for a while if I may 
 Say it again and Ill come around 
 But not for the last time 
 Hey what would you say if I changed 
 Change everything with my name 
 Play it again and Ill come around come around 
 But not for the last time not for the last time 
 And now youre quick to give into your regret 
 And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know 
 I guess you gotta walk away 
 Hey ah yeah how long 
 I guess you gotta get away 
 What you gonna do todayBrave from afar 
 When I hold you for country 
 Saved by a star 
 Can I hold you to one thing 
 Do you feel safe when 
 They tell you they sell you 
 Pray for your children 
 The shelter theyre building 
 Prime time the perfect crime 
 Bow my head the axe we grind 
 Ruse cruise Ps and Qs 
 I got beat up by the evening news 
 Deep hits the media blitz 
 Lost my mind to keep my wits 
 Maintain the same old same 
 Goodbye shiz and so long game 
 Brave from afar 
 Plain Jane the big campaign 
 Last detail has been restrained 
 Fraud fraud the lightning rod 
 See that sign time to applaud 
 The shelter theyre buildingStanding naked in your kitchen 
 Feeling free that I could be alive 
 Clearly Im a contradiction 
 Too young to be my wife 
 A peaceful storm is never hectic 
 Her mellow voice that I could be within 
 The uniform is anorexic 
 A jealous choice wont win 
 A metamorphosis samurai 
 You got a little lord fish 
 And you dont know why 
 I got a metamorphosis samurai 
 Paint your face cause Im a Blackfoot 
 I thought I counted up the fireflies 
 Close enough to get a good look 
 Time to mobilize 
 And I dont know why 
 Im a lonely lad 
 Ive lost myself out on the range 
 I dont remember much 
 So dont ask me Ive gone insane 
 Taking acid in a graveyard 
 Stealing food to keep the night alive 
 Every day I try to play hard 
 Even with my lies 
 The day they found you on a tour bus 
 The news was barren as a desert bone 
 The tabloids made a kind of small fuss 
 A couple pictures shown 
 Slowly turning into driftwood 
 No one ever wants to die alone 
 Thinking that a pretty gift could 
 Make you less unknown 
 Dirty sneakers on the pavement 
 The brilliant features of a common man 
 See the miracle of your life 
 No one ever can 
 See the world go by 
 The changes that we entertain 
 I dont recall it all 
 Remember I have gone insaneThe California animal is a bear 
 Angeleno but the devil may care 
 Summer  time to talk to and swear 
 Later maybe we could share some air 
 Ill take to you the movies there 
 We could walk through Leicester Square 
 What could be wetter than 
 An English girl American man 
 London in the summertime 
 Call me now use the satellite 
 Cuss me out and itll be all right 
 Hesitate but dont refuse 
 The choice is yours but you said choose 
 The look she used was green and sharp 
 Stabbed that boy all in his heart 
 Come what may the cosmos will 
 Take me up and down on Primirose Hill 
 Cuss me out and itll feel all right 
 Its all right now 
 Its all right 
 Down and out and itll sound all right 
 The California flower is a poppy child 
 Felony sends me all the gold in your smile 
 Drift away from anyone you can 
 Nothing ever goes according to plan 
 Though I know that every river bends 
 Time to say hello to snow on the Thames 
 Cuss me out and itll feel all rightGet on top get on top 
 Hit me come get me 
 I bite but she bit me 
 Gorilla Cuntilla 
 Sammy D and Salmonella 
 Come with me cause Im an ass killer 
 Youre ill but Im iller 
 Ill malinger on your block and 
 Give the finger to a cop and 
 Pick a lock before Ill knock and 
 Set you up to get on top 
 Complications of a mastermind 
 Last temptation of my kind 
 Extra planetary sign 
 When do we align 
 All in time 
 Right on 
 Get up and come sit up 
 I light up but she lit it 
 Grasshopper show stopper 
 The life of a wife swapper 
 Come with me cause Im a big bopper 
 You do but I wopper

 Dont give up your fight in life you better buckle down 
 Two days with might in life you better buckle down 
 Leave dreams tonight in life you better buckle down 
 Cause I know whats right 
 Reds are 
 Back bills 
 I know I know I know whats right 
 I know I know I know whats rightThe curtain is open 
 A head to put dope in 
 Now we will come clean it 
 The future weve seen it 
 No no I know I said no no 
 Its like a dream that falls away 
 Into the night where we can play 
 Im on a train one happy day 
 Two eyes for sight three times I pray 
 Soda pop weve got to set up shop 
 And when the weather comes 
 Weve got a pressure drop 
 We dont know 
 But everyday I go 
 To see what I can bring 
 Into a cameo 
 Oh oh oh no 
 We believe We believe 
 Climb a tree for monkey business 
 Write a check out to forgiveness 
 All the world on half an acre 
 Pushing dirt into a quaker 
 The mission the method 
 The downfall arrested 
 Cause its not the first time 
 Nor is it the worst time 
 No no oh no 
 To see the bird without a care 
 For in a word its nice out there 
 In a tree my mama bear 
 Will be all right with proper care 
 Hey hey hey do 
 Boomerang into a bigger bang 
 A little cry of love because they cannot sing 
 Cherokee what did the pharaoh see 
 Another time and space another place to be 
 The motive the measure 
 The purpose the pleasure 
 The risk is it worth it 
 The disc is it perfect 
 I found you amongst them 
 The flower with young stem 
 Disparage the broken 
 The marriage elopinSay it loud 
 Im freaky styley 
 And Im proud 
 repeat many timesSome of us get a little and some a lot 
 Weve got to make due with what ever we got 
 We get it hot we cool it down and then we pass it around 
 You can dance for the sake of a golden day 
 Take a chance on getting rid of whatevers in your way 
 Next stop big hop its turning night into day 
 Sometimes when Im lying there all alone 
 I think of every little nothing that we could own 
 To overthrow all of you who have overgrown 
 All my friends 
 Like to spend 
 Days on end 
 On the mend 
 I turn to you I turn into and then I turn it again 
 All we know 
 Heavy load 
 Start to float 
 Without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again 
 Ive come to learn whatever time I can find to spend 
 Taking flight into whatever light we bend 
 Out in the street I get a beat and then I turn it to ten 
 Lace boots and the ladies of Kazakhstan 
 Kick em high to the sky 
 All of this just because we can 
 I turn to Cuba then Aruba then the Dominican 
 Two things I want to say now 
 You make it all okay now 
 I need to know that you are there 
 Weve got to move it if we want to do our best 
 Weve got to shake it if we want to keep it fresh 
 Im turning down all the heavy psychology 
 To cut a rug and I make no apology 
 I turn a cheek I turn a key and then I turn it for free 
 Weve got to move it just a little to hit the spot 
 A whirling dervish in a flurry a fox to trot 
 Come clown around a robot doing the astronaut 
 I need to know that you are thereListen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon we got high 
 Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space too much pride 
 Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut Soviet Spy 
 Every now and then when I remember to befriend the little things in life 
 Hey youre fine 
 I wanna listen to the radio 
 Driving down Calexico highway 
 And now I know the signs for sure 
 I want to share it all with Mary 
 Results are gonna vary now 
 Later on Ill read to you the things that Ive been needing to say goodbye 
 Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had tell no lies 
 Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off fore you die 
 Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky 
 Skinny brains and little stains upon your face teenage remains tell me more 
 Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time lets soar 
 I wanna listen to your radio 
 And now I know the signs for sure for sure 
 Results are gonna vary nowBlue jean baby LA lady 
 Seamstress for the band 
 Pretty eyed pirate smile 
 You married the music man 
 Ballerina you mustve seen her 
 Dancing in the sand 
 And now shes in me always with me 
 Tiny dancer in my hand 
 Jesus freaks out in the street 
 Handing tickets out for God 
 Turning back she just laughs 
 The boulevard aint that bad 
 Piano man he makes his stand 
 In the auditorium 
 Looking on she sings the songs 
 The words she knows the tunes she hums 
 But oh how real it feels 
 Lying here with no one near 
 Only you and you can hear me 
 When I say softly slowly 
 Hold me closer tiny dancer 
 Count the headlights on the highway 
 Lay me down in sheets of linen 
 You had a busy day today 
 Blue jean baby LA lady 
 You had a busy day todayMaybe if I pray every night 
 Youll come back to me 
 Maybe if I cry every day 
 Youll come back to stay 
 Oh maybe 
 Maybe if I hold your hand 
 Ill be at your command 
 And maybe if I kissed your lips 
 Youll be at my command 
 Ive cried and prayed to the Lord 
 To send you back my love 
 But instead you came to me 
 But only in my dreams 
 Maybe if I pray every night 
 And maybe if I cry every day 
 Maybe maybe maybe 
 Maybe 
 Maybe maybe maybeAll I got is a black cross 
 And two crabs in my left eye 
 What you say you want you want 
 Like a lump in your right thigh 
 Were going left on right 
 And I dont want to see you again 
 Going left on right 
 And I dont wanna be your friend 
 You the users of the wheel 
 Stink of oil and electric eels 
 Users of forbidden tools 
 We must be the fools 
 Cancel the world 
 Erase history 
 There is no future 
 As far as I can see 
 And I dont wanna be your friendShe 
 She

 As far as Im concerned I got a job to do 
 Ive got to pave the way Ive got to save the day 
 Ive got to make it better Ive got to say 
 You and I were millionaires 
 But were a million miles away from the saint who stares 
 Upon the millions who die every day of the week 
 Just because they cant get enough to eat 
 While we the rich dine on all these feasts 
 And everythings fine yeah peaches and creme 
 But it just isnt something youve got to realize 
 Theres something wrong weve got to open our eyes 
 When the world cries we just cant hide 
 Weve got a job to do weve got to save some lives 
 Were millionaires 
 Hey hey Mr Millionaire 
 Twice as nice when you share 
 A spiritual price Do you care 
 Dice the mice when you share 
 Pave the way take the dare 
 Well Im a millionaire too all I know that is true 
 Is that Ive got more cash than I can use 
 I want anything that I can have 
 But I dont need nothin and I never have 
 Each damn day my hearts set far 
 But Ill be okay cause I dont starve 
 Kids from the street the losing their emotion 
 So damn snobby so out of touch 
 With two hungry people who die as they stare 
 At the city at night you know it gives to share 
 So listen up you millionaires 
 Every woman every man help all you can 
 All races unite and I will now concern 
 To the type of problem that helps us learn 
 Pave the way take the dareHey man 
 Oh leave me alone you know 
 Hey man 
 Oh Henry get off the phone I gotta 
 I gotta straighten my face 
 This mellowthighed chick just put my spine out of place 
 My schooldays insane 
 My works down the drain 
 Well shes a total blamblam 
 She said she had to squeeze it but she and then she 
 Oh dont lean on me man 
 Cause you cant afford the ticket 
 Back from Suffragette City 
 Cause you aint got time to check it 
 You know my Suffragette City 
 Is outta sight

 Ah wham bam thank you maam 
 My Suffragette City  Quite alright 
 My Suffragette City  Too fine 
 Oh my Suffragette City 
 SuffragetteDown the street you can hear her scream Youre a disgrace 
 As she slams the door in his drunken face 
 And now he stands outside 
 And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool 
 He cries Oh girl you must be mad 
 What happened to the sweet love you and me had 
 Against the door he leans and starts a scene 
 And his tears fall and burn on the garden green 
 And so castles made of sand 
 Fall in the sea 
 Eventually 
 A little Indian brave who before he was ten 
 Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends 
 And he built a dream that when he grew up 
 He would be a fierce warrior Indian chief 
 Many moons passed fore the dream grew strong 
 Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song 
 And fight his first battle but something went wrong 
 Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
 Melts into the sea 
 There was a young girl whose heart was a frown 
 Because she was crippled for life and she couldnt speak a sound 
 And she wished and prayed she could stop living 
 So she decided to die 
 She drove her wheelchair to the edge of the shore 
 And to her legs she smiled You wont hurt me no more 
 But then a sight shed never seen made her jump and say 
 Look a golden winged ship is passing my way 
 And it really didnt ever stop 
 It just kept on going 
 Slips into the sea 
 EventuallyLet me tell you now 
 When I had you to myself 
 I didnt want you around 
 Those pretty faces always made you 
 Stand out in a crowd 
 But someone picked you from the bunch 
 One glance was all it took 
 Now its much too late for me 
 To take a second look 
 Oh baby give me one more chance 
 To show you that I love you 
 Wont you please let me 
 Back in your heart 
 Oh darling I was blind to let you go 
 Let you go baby 
 But now since I see you in his arms 
 I want you back 
 Yes I do now 
 Ooh ooh baby 
 Na na na na 
 Trying to live without your love 
 Is one long sleepless night 
 Let me show you girl 
 That I know wrong from right 
 Every street you walk on 
 I leave tear stains on the ground 
 Following the girl 
 I didnt even want around 
 Let me tell you now 
 Oh baby all I need is one more chance 
 Oh darlin I was blind to let you go 
 Let you go baby 
 But now since I see you in his arms uh huh 
 A buh buh buh buh 
 All I want 
 All I need 
 Oh just one more chance 
 To show you that I love you 
 Baby baby baby baby baby baby 
 Forget what happened then 
 And let me live again 
 Oh baby I was blind to let you go 
 Spare me of this cause 
 Gimme back what I lost 
 Oh baby I need one more chance ha 
 I tell ya that I love you 
 Baby ow baby baby 
 I want you back 
 I want you backWoke up this morning like I always do 
 I still like to think that Im new 
 Time just gets its way 
 Strawberries left to decay 
 Cant find my pants or my bank account 
 Dont you slip away 
 Voices that start to betray 
 Even though you raised me I will never be your father 
 King of each and every Sunset Marquis 
 Even though youre crazy you will never be a bother 
 Youre my Old Man In the Sea 
 I still like to laugh when I make a joke 
 I still like to think that theres hope 
 Time just has its say 
 Struck by the sight of an empty hall 
 Dont you fade away 
 Youre my Old Man in the Sea 
 The hunter gets hunted 
 We all get confronted 
 Dont just slip away 
 Youre my Old Man In the SeaComing on to the light of day 
 We got many moons that are deep at play 
 So I keep an eye on the shadow smile 
 To see what it has to say 
 You and I both know 
 Everything must go away 
 What do you say 
 Spinning knot that is on my heart 
 Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark 
 You got sneak attack from the zodiac 
 But I see your fire spark 
 Eat the breeze and go 
 Blow by blow and go away 
 What do you say Yeah 
 You dont know my mind 
 You dont know my kind 
 Dark necessities are part of my design 
 Tell the world that Im 
 Falling from the sky 
 Stumble down to the parking lot 
 You got no time for the afterthought 
 Theyre like ice cream for an astronaut 
 Well thats me looking for we 
 Turn the corner and 
 Find the world at your command 
 Playing the hand 
 Do you want this love of mine 
 Darkness helps us all to shine 
 Do you want it do you want it now 
 Do you want it all the time 
 But darkness helps us all to shine 
 Pick you up like a paperback 
 With the track record of a maniac 
 So I move it in and we unpack 
 Its the same as yesterday 
 Any way we roll 
 Falling from the sky and 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh ohEverything inside of me 
 Is burning up for you to see 
 And if we should get into it 
 A twoway kind of syndicate hold me 
 Compare us to a ferris wheel 
 Just be sure of what you want to steal 
 Some people do it by the book 
 But I prefer to go by feel tell me 
 I wanted to get outta here 
 But every time I reappear 
 And know I have the words my dear 
 To whisper right into your ear hey yeah 
 Cmon girl 
 Lets get it right 
 The spirit of a dragons tear 
 Is lovely at this time of year 
 The cave within your mountainside 
 Is deeper than it will be wide hold me 
 My disenchanted diplomat 
 Asleep inside the laundromat 
 Conveyor belts are moving 
 And I want you to be sure of that tell me 
 And if you let it germinate 
 I know it will be worth the wait 
 Disputed by the news that it was you 
 Who tried to instigate hey yeah 
 Blessed are the hypocrites 
 Outwitted but she never quits 
 The trouble with a band of slits 
 Is washing off the muddy bits hey yeah 
 Oh yeah shes with me and Im your man 
 If I cant find you no one canA long long long long time ago 
 Before the wind before the snow 
 Lived a man lived a man I know 
 Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho 
 Sir Psycho Sexy that is me 
 Sometimes I find I need to scream ah 
 Hes a freak of nature but we love him so 
 Hes a freak of nature but we let him go 
 Deep inside the Garden of Eden 
 Standing there with my hardon bleeding 
 Theres a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen 
 Good God no that would be treason 
 Believe me Eve she gave me good reason 
 Booty looking too good not to be squeezing 
 Creamy beaver hotter than a fever 
 Im a giving cause shes the receiver 
 I wont and I dont hang up until I please her 
 Making her feel like an overachiever 
 I take it away for a minute just to tease her 
 Then I give it back a little bit deeper 
 Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yeah 
 Hes the man that I met one time 
 Hes the man that left me blind 
 Hes the man hes the man hes the man

 And then she tried to cop a feel 
 That cop she was all dressed in blue 
 Was she pretty Boy Im telling you 
 She stuck my butt with her big black stick 
 I said whats up now suck my dick 
 Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb 
 She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand 
 On her crotch so very warm 
 I could feel her getting wet through her uniform 
 Propping her up on the black and white 
 Unzipped and slipped Ooh thats tight 
 I swatted her like no SWAT team can 
 Turned a cherry pie right into jam

 To be with you

 Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down 
 Descending waves of graceful pleasure 
 For your love there is no measure 
 Her curves they bend with subtle splendor 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the funk will make me freak 
 If I should die before I waked 
 Allow me Lord to rock out naked 
 Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip 
 Calling up a little girl with a bull whip

 Girl getting off all in my lap 
 The tallest tree the sweetest sap 
 Blowing my ass right off the map

 When I saw you 
 I hope I get what you deserve 
 And this is where I find 
 Smoke surrounds your perfect face 
 And Im falling 
 Pushing a broom out into space 
 And this is where I found a way 
 The stadium arcadium 
 A mirror to the moon mirror to the moon 
 Well Im forming and Im warming to you 
 State of the art until the clouds come crashing 
 Stranger things have happened both 
 Before and after noon before and after noon 
 Pushing myself and no I dont mind asking now 
 Alone inside in my forest room 
 And its storming 
 I never thought Id be in bloom 
 But this is where I start 
 Derelict days and the stereo plays 
 For the all night crowd that it cannot phase 
 And Im calling 
 Tedious weeds that the media breeds 
 But the animal gets what the animal needs 
 And Im sorry 
 And Im forming and Im warming to you 
 Rays of dust that wrap around 
 Your Citizen 
 Kind enough to disavow 
 This is where I stand 
 A state of the art until the clouds come crashing 
 Im pushing myself and no I dont mind asking 
 And Im forming and Im warming to youDeep inside the soul hole 
 Of Mother Earth 
 Father Time came 
 With a supersonic supersonic burst 
 His soul monkey sperm tribes 
 Racing to be first 
 Her ruby fruit jungle 
 Givin bush baby bush baby birth 
 The baby was a boy 
 But I think what stunned her 
 Is that this bare breasted baby 
 Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder 
 Crackin from his thumb bone 
 Came thelonious thunder 
 Fill the sky with hellfire 
 From way down down down under 
 I am a jungle man 
 I get all the bush I can 
 Erupting from the ground 
 In Hollywood he glowed 
 His jungle turned to concrete 
 His funk bone bone bone bone to stone 
 Like a full blown volcano 
 I must let it be known 
 That through this boys vein 
 Atomic lava blood flows and flows 
 His soul shocking sounds 
 They make the mountains moan 
 This boys become a man 
 Its time to take take take 
 Take the throne 
 I get all the bush I canIve got a bad disease 
 Up from my brain is where I bleed 
 Insanity it seems 
 Has got me by my soul to squeeze 
 Well all the love from thee 
 With all the dying trees I scream 
 The angels in my dreams yeah 
 Have turned to demons of greed thats me 
 Where I go I just dont know

 I could live without that 
 Im just a modest man 
 Meet at the corner and oh

 Im guessing were through now 
 Receding into the forest 
 I will lay around and wait and Ill wait for you 
 Please dont ask me where 
 Oh where you think Ive been 
 Ive been a lot of places 
 But this could be my win 
 Im guessing were through now

 Please dont say you want 
 To keep in touch out there 
 To see you on the corner 
 Well that I just cant bear 
 Meet me at the corner and oh 
 I will lay around and wait 
 Hey and I turn 
 I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods 
 A sign from the gods that you werent meant to be mine 
 And its fine 
 Taking it all for a ride 
 Till the day when its gone 
 Mystified by where it all went wrong 
 When its gone 
 I live and I learn 
 And I lose and I win 
 But its better than ever whenever Im in 
 Thank you girl for everywhere that Ive beenSomething inside the cards I know is right 
 Dont wanna live somebody elses life 
 This is what I want to be 
 And this is what I give to you because I get it free 
 She smiles while I do my time 
 I could die for you 
 Oh this life I choose 
 Im here to be your only gobetween 
 To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen 
 What I really want to do is turn it into motion beauty that I cant abuse 
 You know that I use my senses to 
 You can see that its only everywhere 
 Id take it all and then Id find a way to share 
 Come along and go alone with me 
 Wander with me yo its all for free 
 What you wanna do 
 Come again and tell me where you wanna go 
 What it means for me to be with you alone 
 Close the door and no one has to know 
 How we are 
 Oh this life I chooseHistorys so strong 
 Historys so strong 
 Sing another drinking song 
 The honkytonk will do 
 Make another breaking bong 
 Your favorite ingenue 
 This the distant dawn 
 I put my cards upon the table 
 I do to speak as I am able 
 One pixies brokendown devotion 
 I threw my pistol in the ocean 
 Eyes wide with revelation 
 Shine at the police station 
 And when the burden comes round 
 Im sure that you will go down 
 Stay all night we save the population 
 This the land its pawn 
 Sailing through the Lexicon 
 A pistol and its hot 
 Blood and border lines withdrawn 
 Take another bottle down the block 
 To land the shrew 
 Make another awful sound 
 To ride the gothic through 
 Stay all night we save the populationShow me a sign that I love you 
 Blow me a mind as you always do 
 Remind me to tell you that Ive come to 
 Believe in the beauty the power of you 
 Woman dissolve into the sea 
 The body of water is calling me 
 The god of my daughter is always free 
 Theres nothing to solve and youre solving me 
 Ooh Im in your company 
 Ooh body thats calling me 
 Throw me a line I could use one 
 I specialdesign me cause Im your son 
 Two thousand below where I feel my love 
 The body of water where I come from 
 Im dreaming got a reason to steal 
 Fire from the other side out there 
 Formations flow like screams 
 Im made with a life to spare 
 Get the jizz Mister sism got a rhythm 
 Technology of a prayer 
 Scientist to the prism of faith 
 And hope so I am there 
 Baby Im old can you come here 
 The science of love is becoming clear 
 Invisible love with the color still 
 I need to a place in the atmosphere 
 And I may believeI saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say 
 Your eyes had wandered off to something distant cold and grey 
 I guess you didnt see it coming 
 Someones gotten used to slumming 
 Dreaming of the golden years 
 I see you had to change careers 
 Far away but we both know its somewhere 
 I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday 
 The driftwood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pay 
 I know you from another picture 
 Someone with the most conviction 
 We used to read the funny papers 
 Fooled around and pulled some capers 
 Not today I send a message to her 
 A message that Im coming coming to pursue her 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I got you ten times over Ill chase you down til youre dead 
 I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray 
 An empty shell of loveliness now dusted with decay 
 What happened to the funny paper 
 Smiling was your money maker 
 Someone oughta situate her 
 Find a way to educate her 
 All the way time to come and find you 
 You cant hide from me girl so never mind what I do 
 I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head 
 I saw you in the churchyard there was no time to exchange 
 You were getting married and it felt so very strange 
 I guess I didnt see it coming 
 Now I guess its me whos bumming 
 You and I were mixing tears 
 Not today not for me but someone 
 Never could get used to so now I will refuse to 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I got my best foot forward and Ill chase you down til youre deadNever too soon to be through 
 Too much for me and too much for you 
 Youre gonna loose in time 
 Every turn looking to burn 
 Some never learn live and learn 
 Stop searching for a curse 
 Before you end up in a hearse 
 That you hurt inside inside 
 Pains part of life dont hide behind your false pride 
 Dont slip away and dont forget 
 Ill give you more than you can get 
 Too late to tell you how I feel 
 I want you back but I get real 
 Can you hear my falling tears 
 Making rain where you lay 
 Can end up being such a bore 
 Its so lonely when you dont even know yourselfThis is my time this is my tear 
 I can see clearly now that this is not a place for playing solitaire 
 Tell me where you want me 
 This is my time this is my tear 
 Coming on strong Baudelaire 
 Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare 
 Let it rise before you 
 This is my crime 
 All in all and Im loving every rise and fall 
 The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this 
 In the end and then all will be forgiven 
 When surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give 
 Say it now because you never know 
 Devil may cry devil may care 
 Distillers got a scream and now I know just why when shes moving air 
 Can you feel the voltage 
 This is my time 
 California skies got room to spare 
 Oh never know 
 Take it outside take it out there 
 In the final moment 
 Oh never knowDeath 
 Let me catch my breath 
 Let me see whats left 
 Let me see whats true 
 Do I really want to 
 Run from my depths 
 Will I have regrets 
 Will I ever find you 
 Will I ever find words 
 That give me motive to express 
 Bread 
 Will I go unfed 
 Will I be that who rushes on in 
 To where angels fear to tread 
 Was it me who bled 
 On the new death bed 
 And there is no fear 
 When youre leaning on love 
 Those grateful dead 
 Someone like you 
 To research the meaning of love 
 Someone I do 
 To be there when push comes to shove 
 I know that you know 
 The ending the must 
 Chess let me play my best 
 When I do regress let it all unwind 
 Cause were never confined 
 To the board unless 
 Less I second guess 
 Look into the sky where we all comply 
 With something higher than the 
 Rest of my love sail through 
 Sky all around 
 Fell to the ground 
 Now Im a child 
 Stayed for a while 
 Flesh  is it meaningless 
 But we all protest 
 To the last request 
 Is there anything you 
 Could now suggest 
 Did I do my best 
 Did I leave it better 
 Even though we look to be 
 Just mildly obsessed with you 
 Sail through 
 To be thereIf I stall at all or 
 Hesitate 
 The world of always 
 Never seems to wait 
 A comedy that could be 
 So divine 
 Never Is A Long Time 
 A shadow born 
 To steal the light of day 
 You woke me up 
 And said cmon lets play 
 Well now I know 
 That never has its way 
 You are you are 
 The star I say 
 From far from far 
 From far away 
 The laws that cause 
 It all to stay 
 By you by you 
 For you I do 
 I thought Id done it all 
 I thought I knew 
 But nothing ever looked 
 As good as you 
 Now every never 
 That I knew was fine 
 Never is a long time 
 And now I share 
 This feeling with my dad 
 Stolen goods arent always 
 Half that bad 
 The never that well always 
 The faded piping on your press 
 Will always have its place I guess 
 A common love 
 That we can bless 
 The pleasure of 
 My childs mess 
 Golden books 
 And tenderness 
 Have rescued me 
 From emptiness 
 It all it all it all 
 It all it all it all to stayAnd if I had a clue 
 Id know exactly what do to 
 If I were the wiser of the two 
 And if I saw it all so clear 
 Id write it down and bend your ear 
 If I were the clearer of the two 
 We can take a walk 
 Into the canyons of 5th Avenue 
 Sing and dance just to name a few 
 All I do 
 And if I heard the angels sing 
 Id sing it back to you and bring 
 Sound of heaven ringing just for you 
 And if I saw the sun fall down 
 Id pick it up and make a crown 
 One that was a perfect fit for you 
 Into the apple orchard by the school 
 We could make a little residue 
 We can find a place to stay 
 A secret little hideaway 
 Spend a little time inside of you 
 All eyes 
 All eyes on you hey 
 All I do hey 
 All I doIve got myself 
 In a masochistic hold 
 Why dont you let go 
 Shake it off 
 Just to redirect my flow 
 Come on lets go 
 Sit up straight 
 Im on a double date 
 Ive got to find my way 
 Into the light heavy middle weight 
 We dont stop rock around the clock 
 Motor mouthing off 
 In front of every other road block 
 Come again and tell me 
 What youre going through 
 Like a girl who only knew 
 Her child was due 
 Memories of everything 
 Of lemon trees on mercury 
 Come to me with remedies 
 From five or six of seven seas 
 You always took me with a smile 
 When I was down 
 That blew through 
 Looking up into 
 A reverse vertigo 
 What an undertow 
 Give it up 
 Another stubborn scorpio 
 Come on lets go 
 To the moon she gave 
 Another good review 
 Turn around and look at me 
 Its really really you 
 That blew throughDeep inside of a parallel 
 Universe 
 Its getting harder and harder 
 To tell what came first 
 Under water where thoughts can breathe 
 Easily 
 Far away you were made in a sea 
 Just like me 
 Christ Im a sidewinder Im a 
 California king 
 I swear its everywhere 
 Its everything 
 Staring straight up into the sky 
 Oh my my 
 A solar system that fits in your eye 
 Microcosm 
 You could die but youre never dead 
 Spider web 
 Take a look at the stars in your head 
 Fields of space kid 
 Psychic changes are born in your heart 
 Entertain 
 A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same 
 Bless your heart girl 
 Kill the pressure its raining on 
 Salty Cheeks 
 When you hear the beloved song 
 I am with you 
 Its everythingIts always half and half 
 Im happy and Im sad 
 Everything thats beautiful 
 Always kills me too 
 The highest I get up 
 Is the deepest I get down 
 Youre up there with your life 
 Thats why I gotta shout shout 
 And then gotta shout shout 
 Blues for Meister 
 You sweet little thing 
 Im so sad I gotta sing 
 A cozy little kitty up 
 Sittin on the couch 
 Oh kitty cat oh baby 
 I really miss you now 
 Well have some respect 
 For my cat 
 He got squashed by the wheel 
 Of a Cadillac 
 Well me and my pussy 
 We lost our flow 
 Well goodbye my little calico 
 Your foods still in the cupboard 
 Hangin in its can 
 You used to love to eat it 
 Down 
 Ill always love you Meister 
 You were so good to me 
 Theres nothing like you nowhere 
 As far as I can seeNot another motherfucking 
 Politician 
 Doin nothin but something for his own ambition 
 HuhEverybody knows about Hollywood skunks 
 Soulful sex and funky monks 
 My tinsel town is made of steel 
 Lets whimp lets shout lets make a deal 
 Hollywood or Hollywood not 
 We are so lively on the spot 
 Feel so alive dont know where to stop 
 Are you deaf or dumb or what 
 Silly little creature Sikamikanico 
 Sittin on a bleacher Sikamikanico 
 I dont want a teacher Sikamikanico 
 If were gonna reach ya Sikamikanico 
 Dont you know bout Frank Sinatra 
 Thats all gone because I got up 
 We dont just play we display 
 Gotta give it up gotta do it my way 
 Shootin my sex up to the cave 
 You might receive my radio wave 
 Shake it girl you wont get hurt 
 I knock my dick into the dirt 
 Anybody want some Sikamikanico 
 Everybody on the run Sikamikanico 
 Rock it more breeza Sikamikanico 
 If were gonna treasure Sikamikanico 
 Hey ho lets go 
 Mother fucker wanna be a jigolo 
 Let me demolo how it goes 
 Under ho sittin on my big toe 
 Hey Joe a radio chump 
 Ill never gonna overcome in Hollywood Ill come alone 
 Oh no it would now leave my nose that you blow 
 Hey ho lets go 
 So big boy say you want bad news 
 We doubt your mamas been confused 
 Its plain to see we rock the groove 
 If you dont like it time to move 
 And all the press you dont amaze me 
 Im not your dick so dont appraise me 
 Never gonna fit your critical shit 
 You better watch out you might get hit 
 If were gonna treasure SikamikanicoDrivin up the coast 
 To find a version of the truth 
 Left the backdoor swinging 
 Like a dirty little sleuth 
 The truth is I have never left 
 Felt half this alive 
 Now its time to dance 
 Upon the grave called fortyfive 
 Jacked up on some Kerouac 
 And surely bulletproof 
 The girl who taught me what to do 
 Was missing her front tooth 
 Gentle as a storm 
 Inside your mental health 
 I want to find the answer 
 But I just cant find myself 
 I say so long 
 To the way I played 
 The way I played 
 Inside of yesterday 
 Hey lets run around 
 The great escape 
 From out of my hometown 
 Later I would look for love 
 Inside a womans dorm 
 A couch to keep me humble 
 And her breath to keep me warm 
 Ophelia was the girl 
 That I was feeling for 
 Come to realize 
 It was me who was the whore 
 A captain lost himself 
 Inside a forty year old skull 
 The drink of choice was knowledge 
 And we always wanted more 
 Drunken sailors 
 Seeking their Geronimo 
 Instead they found the things 
 That they really didnt want to know 
 Country roads 
 Would never let me stay 
 A devils growl and cats meow 
 Were blended into one 
 Termites called suburbanites 
 Were eating all the fun 
 A juggernaut of comedy 
 And blasphemy 
 I wanna stop the madness 
 But I think it has to be 
 From out of my hometownWere all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way 
 Along with six million others in this place called LA 
 LA is the place sets my mind ablaze 
 For me its a race through a cotton pickin maze 
 The town makes me jump its got a bunch of bad chicks 
 Well sure its got some chumps but I still get my kicks 
 My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick 
 Like a come on a thumb 
 Poppin hump hump hump pop out 
 The action never stops Im as wild as can be 
 Cause Im shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea 
 Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop 
 But he never met the Tree so he never bebopped out hop 
 Antwan the Swan from the pretty fish pond 
 Was a bad mother jumper you could tell he was strong 
 He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat 
 And between his legs was a sweat young lass 
 He threw a hundred women up against the wall 
 And he swore to fear that hed love em all 
 By the time he got to ninety nine he had to stop 
 Because thats when he thought that he heard a phone 
 Last night and the night before I heard a 
 Fop outside then I came in doors 
 Freak out 
 Now that I told you a little something about the Flea 
 A little something about the Tree a little something about me 
 I cant leave you hangin but my man Shermzy he swings the yang he bangs the 
 Yang 
 And now its time to hear him do his playin you better be burning Sherman 
 Were all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way 
 Step outWhoo 
 Stiff club 
 Its my nature 
 Custom love 
 Is the nomenclature 
 Turn down 
 Mass confusion 
 Hit the road cause we just keep cruising 
 Double my fun 
 Double my vision 
 Long hard look at my last decision 
 Hustle here 
 Hustle there 
 Hustle me bitch and you best beware 
 Its emotional 
 And I told you so 
 But you had to know 
 So I told you 
 Soft walk 
 To horizon 
 One big crash that no one dies in 
 This is for the folks in Fayetteville 
 Itll come true if you say it will 
 Look around look around look around 
 All around all around all around 
 Please dont 
 Look right through me 
 It hurts my heart 
 When you do that to me 
 Street life 
 Out my window 
 City may breeze gonna stroke my skin though 
 Just a lot of words 
 On an old brick wall 
 Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree straw 
 Put my peg 
 Into your square 
 Run around like we just dont care 
 All around oh yeah 
 Move it I gotta get ya wanna getcha 
 When Im feeling small and Im hitting a wall 
 Wanna feel it all around 
 Wanna feel it all aroundGettin born in the state of Mississippi 
 Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie 
 In Alabama she would swing a hammer 
 Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama 
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor 
 What in the world does your company take me for 
 Black bandanna sweet Louisiana 
 Robbin on a bank in the state of Indiana 
 Shes a runner rebel and a stunner 
 On her merry way sayin Baby whatcha gonna 
 Looking down the barrel of a hot metal fortyfive 
 Just another way to survive 
 California rest in peace 
 Simultaneous release 
 California show your teeth 
 Shes my priestess Im your priest 
 Yeah yeah 
 Shes a lover baby and a fighter 
 Shoulda seen it comin when it got a little brighter 
 With a name like Dani California 
 Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya 
 A little loaded she was stealin another breath 
 I love my baby to death 
 Who knew the other side of you 
 Who knew what others died to prove 
 Too true to say goodbye to you 
 Too true to say say say 
 Push the fader gifted animator 
 One for the now and eleven for the later 
 Never made it up to Minnesota 
 North Dakota man was agunnin for the quota 
 Down in the Badlands she was savin the best for last 
 It only hurts when I laugh 
 Gone too fast 
 Yeah yeahShiver for me girl 
 Deliver for me my darling 
 Pushing up to you 
 A river that runs right through you 
 Swim for your smile in a blue rock quarry 
 Make it for me baby you wont be sorry 
 Shiver for me now 
 Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam 
 Settle for love youre never far from home 
 Carry me down into the waters of 
 Carry me down into the water of love 
 Two of us were made of angel dust 
 Ive been around but not around enough 
 Shadow my free form 
 A woman that I could keep warm 
 Quiver for me girl 
 Give me your head and shoulders 
 Shot from the pages of love and glory 
 Sleeping next to you and Im in your story 
 Lets go I know Ill make it for two 
 And then intuitions only what you take from it 
 I know Ill make it for two 
 And then you were there and I was fortunate 
 And then a messy bed apology that I will fall for you yeah 
 Ill make it for two Ill make it for two and 
 A living that I could 
 Be given to you my sweet love 
 Sleeping next to you and Im in your dream 
 Settle for love 
 Settle for loveBehold I am Funkadelic 
 I am not of your world 
 But fear me not 
 I will do you no harm 
 Loan me your funky mind and I shall play with it 
 For nothing is good unless you play with it 
 And all that is good is nasty

 Cause Im so afraid

 Each night I ask the stars up above

 Keeps coming back dissatisfied 
 Elementary son but its so 
 My love affair with everywhere was innocent 
 Why do you care 
 Someone start the car time to go 
 Youre the best I know 
 My sunny side has up and died 
 Im betting that when we collide 
 The universe will shift into a low 
 The travesties that we have seen 
 Are treating me like Benzedrine 
 Automatic laughter from a pro 
 My what a good day for a walk outside 
 Id like to get to know you a little better baby 
 God knows that I really tried 
 My what a good day for a take out bride 
 Id like to say we did it for the better of 
 I saw you there so unaware 
 Those hummingbirds all in your hair 
 The disrepair of Norma Jean 
 Could not compare to your routine 
 Balarama beauty goin toe to toe 
 My what a good day for a let it slide 
 I thought about it and I brought it out 
 Im motivated by the lack of doubt 
 Im consecrated but Im not devout 
 The mother the father the daughter yeah 
 Right on the verge just one more dose 
 Im traveling from coast to coast 
 My theory isnt perfect but its close 
 Im almost there why should I care 
 My heart is hurting when I share 
 Someone open up let it show 
 My what a good day for a walk outside 
 Id like to think we did it for the better of 
 Im consecrated but Im not devout 
 The mother the father the daughter 
 Oh you dont form in the wet sand 
 You dont form at all 
 Woah you dont form in the wet sand 
 I do yeah 
 You dont form in the wet sand 
 I do yeahTo finger paint is not a sin 
 I put my middle finger in 
 Your monthly blood is what I win 
 Im in your house now let me spin 
 Python power straight from Monty 
 Celluloid love got a John Frusciante 
 Spread your head and spread the blanket 
 Shes too free Im the patient 
 Black and white red and blue 
 Things that look good on you 
 And if I scream dont let me go 
 A purple stain  I know 
 Knock on wood we all stay good 
 Cause we all live in Hollywood 
 With Dracula and Darla Hood 
 Unspoken words were understood 
 Up to my ass in alligators 
 Lets get it on with alligator haters 
 Did what you did  did what you said 
 Whats the point yo whats the spread 
 And if I call for you to stay 
 Come hit the funk on your way 
 Its the way out there but I dont care 
 Cause this is where I go 
 Its way out there 
 But I dont care 
 Cause this is what 
 I want to wear 
 To finger paint is not a sin 
 Feather light but you cant move this 
 Farley is and angel and I can prove this 
 Purple is the stain upon my pillow 
 Lets sleep weeping willow 
 Its way out there but I dont care 
 Cause this is where  I go 
 Cause we all live in HollywoodSay goodbye to Oz and everything you own 
 California dreamin is a Pettibon 
 LAs screaming youre my home 
 Vanity is blasted but its rarely fair 
 I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair 
 Got a lot of friends but is anyone there 
 I dont know but its been said 
 Your heart is stronger than your head 
 And this location is my home 
 Stick and move youre living in a quick world 
 Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl 
 Born into it thats for sure 
 Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected 
 Well sick love comes to wash us away 
 Prisons of perspective how your vision gets corrected 
 And sick love is my modern cliché 
 People talk and tell you what you want to hear 
 Do you really need another souvenir 
 Superheroes tend to disappear 
 Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass 
 Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast 
 Chase your tail my baby itll be your last 
 Openly defective is the lover you elected 
 And a portrait she was bound to portrayThey say in chess youve got to kill the queen and then you made it 
 Oh I do you 
 A funny thing the king who gets himself assassinated 
 Hey now every time I lose altitude 
 You took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated 
 Now put away your welcome soon youll find youve over stayed it 
 So divine hell of an elevator 
 All the while my fortune faded 
 Never mind the consequences of the crime 
 This time my fortunes faded 
 The medicated state of mind youve found is overrated 
 You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it 
 Come on God do I seem bullet proof 
 This time my fortunes fadedOoh 
 Fallin free fallin free 
 Fallin free 
 Ooh 
 You and me you and me 
 You and me 
 I feel love I feel love 
 I feel love 
 I feel love I feel love I feel love 
 OohThirty dirty birds 
 Sitting on a curb 
 Chirping and Burping 
 And eating 
 Dirty earthworms 
 Along comes Herbie 
 From thirtythird 
 And third 
 Saw the thirty 
 Dirty birds 
 Boy he was 
 DisturbedHow strong is my love Oh 
 How strong is my love Oh 
 How wrong could it be 
 Ill walk a water mile 
 Rest a while to kiss your smile 
 Laugh and roll and after a while 
 Ill begin to like your style 
 She turned me down this time she 
 She turned me down 
 Lord I cant believe she 
 She turned me inside out 
 All I ask of you 
 Is turn me up this time 
 Come on over show me your 
 Your glow soul I do adore 
 Ill be sure to drop my guard 
 Give it up its not that hard 
 She turned me inside out she 
 Tested life but thats all right 
 Darker than the darkest night 
 Living hell and pollocks at you 
 Getting new down your back 
 How wrong could it beMy friends are so depressed 
 I feel the question of your loneliness 
 Confide cause Ill be on your side 
 You know I will 
 Exgirlfriend called me up 
 Alone and desperate on the prison phone 
 They want to give her seven years 
 For being sad 
 I love all of you 
 Hurt by the cold 
 So hard and lonely too 
 When you dont know yourself 
 My friends are so distressed 
 And standing on the brink of emptiness 
 No words I know of to express 
 This emptiness 
 Imagine me 
 Taught by tragedy 
 Release 
 Is peace 
 I heard a little girl 
 And what she said was something beautiful 
 To give your love no matter what 
 Is what she said 
 When you dont know yourselfLeaving town to find the flower that I could deserve 
 Someone moves someones bound to get their feelings hurt 
 Im loving you youre out of range 
 I wanted you youre out of range 
 As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill 
 I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil 
 Wanted to youre out of range 
 I dont want to much more than 
 Than to be reborn in the morning 
 Reborn so I can feel ya 
 The thorns are blooming with ya 
 I feel ya 
 I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times 
 Barely there your voice is cracking up across state lines 
 Loving you youre out of range 
 Wanted you youre out of range 
 Skies of ecstasy were breaking up 
 While I do believe the tears of God were 
 Falling down upon my swollen cheeks 
 I know it hurts when its taken away 
 I tell you that I could be living 
 Today with you or without you ok 
 Lost by the rain and its all gonna change 
 No sir not to much more than 
 Than to be 
 Reborn in the morning 
 I feel yaIt started when we were little kids 
 Free spirits but already tormented 
 By our own hands given to us by our parents 
 We got together and wrote on desks 
 And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
 And slipped through whatever cracks 
 We can find minds altered 
 We didnt falter in portraying hysterical 
 And tragic characters 
 In a smog filled universe 
 We loved the dirty city 
 And the journeys away 
 From it we had not yet been 
 Or seen our friends selves 
 Chase tails round and round in 
 A downward spiral leaving a trail 
 Of irretrievable vital life juice 
 Behind still the brothers blood 
 Comrades partner family 
 Cuzz was impenetrable 
 And we lived inside it laughing 
 With no clothes and everything 
 Experimental till death was upon us 
 In our face mortality 
 And lots of things seemed futile 
 Then but love and music can save us 
 And did while the giant grey monster grew 
 More poisoned and volatile around us 
 And jaws clamping down 
 And spewing ugly shit around 
 Nothing is the same so we keep moving 
 We keep moving 
 Went off and off and got some hair cuts 
 Lookin wild and got all drugged up 
 Hopped a train into the night 
 Got a ride with a transvestite 
 Two boys in San Francisco 
 Blasted off in a Bart bathroom 
 Those coppers woke us up 
 Mothersfuckers woke us up 
 Two young brothers on a hover craft 
 Telepathetic love and bellylaughs 
 Storm the stage of Universal 
 Slim shine talk boy go subversal 
 Papas proud and so he sent us 
 Pounding hearts full and relentless 
 Two boys in London England 
 Climbing out of hostel windows 
 Wearing gear so out but in though 
 Come on kind and do the no no 
 Two young brothers on a hovercraft 
 Telepathics love and belly laughs 
 We went to Fairfax High School 
 Jumped off buildings into their pools 
 Wed sit down and grease at Canters 
 Run like hell they cant catch us 
 Two boys in LA proper 
 Stealin anything that we could 
 Gotta sneak into the Starwood 
 Gotta peak into the deep good 
 I remember ten years ago 
 In Hollywood we did some good 
 And we did some real bad stuff 
 But the Butthole Surfers 
 Always said its better to regret 
 Something you did than something you didnt do 
 We were young and we were looking looking for the deep kick 
 Seen em come seen em goThrow me all around like a boomerang sky 
 Whatever you do dont tell me why 
 Poppies grow tall then say byebye 
 The wave is here 
 A seamless little team and then we tanked 
 I guess were not so sacrosanct 
 The tip of my tongue but then we blanked 
 Waiting on the wind to tell my side 
 Ready set jet but she never gets far 
 Listen to your skin from the seat of my car 
 Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar 
 The longest wave 
 Whatcha want 
 Whatcha need 
 Do you love 
 Maybe Im the right one 
 Maybe Im the wrong 
 Just another play the pirate and the papillon 
 Time to call it a day 
 Maybe youre my last love 
 Maybe youre my first 
 Just another way to play inside the universe 
 Now I know why we came 
 Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gage 
 Under my skin and half my age 
 Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage 
 Waiting on the wind to turn my page 
 Steady your sails for the butterfly flap 
 Whatever you do dont close that gap 
 Im dreaming of a woman but shes just my nap 
 Your ship is in 
 Waiting on the tide so I can swim 
 Now I knowWhy dont you love me like you used to do 
 How come you treat me like a worn out shoe 
 My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue 
 So why dont you love me like you used to do 
 Why dont you spot me like you used to do 
 When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do 
 Im the same old trouble that youve always been through 
 Why dont you be the way you used to be 
 How come you fight so many fights with me 
 Somebody changed so lemme give you a clue 
 Why dont you love me like you used to do 
 Why dont you say the things you used to say 
 How come you treat me like a piece of clay 
 You cant keep a lovin and a huggin and a kissin and I dont know why 
 We dont get near or further closer land of country mouths 
 I dont love like a huggin and a kissin and I dont know why 
 Take the ball 
 We dont get near or further closer land of country mouthsI should be on my way 
 I really ought not stay 
 Far to strong with the pinnup on 
 Hear my conscience Im gone 
 I should have let you know 
 This boy was made to roam 
 The band is who Im married to 
 And this is what god said to do 
 I let my motor stray 
 Forgive me where I play 
 Sendin my love to a Tennessee 
 She got style now lets see 
 I remember who 
 To surrender to 
 The captain of my ship is brave 
 Its brothers hood on a mothers day 
 Do do do dit do 
 Aw sure enough I love you 
 Aw sure enough I do 
 So just remember who you 
 Who you surrender to 
 Im off to wonderland 
 Just in my second hand 
 Life is short but aint it grand 
 Im a way outside but in demand 
 Ill take it on my chin 
 Go back and forth again 
 Find me on some telephone 
 With a broken down voice and a shakeed tone 
 Do unto others who 
 You would have do to you 
 Aint no way Id ever trade 
 That sparer life for this piece of shade 
 Destined for battle zone 
 Whys there no lesson known 
 The lessons not to wait for me 
 Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet 
 Let your joy decide 
 Let your joy divide 
 Everything we do 
 Let your motor ride 
 Ow help me 
 We could have made it my love 
 We could have skated through

 Were in my life just to get high on

 When I lay it on come get to play it on 
 All my life to sacrifice 
 Hey oh 
 Listen what I say oh

 Now listen what I say oh oh 
 When will I know that I really cant go 
 To the well once more time to decide on 
 When its killing me when will I really see 
 All that I need to look inside 
 Come to believe that I better not leave 
 Before I get my chance to ride 
 When its killing me what do I really need 
 Come back and hey oh 
 Look at what I say oh 
 The more I see the less I know 
 The more I like to let it go 
 Hey oh woah 
 Deep beneath the cover 
 Of another perfect wonder 
 Where its so white as snow 
 Privately divided 
 By a world so undecided 
 And theres nowhere to go 
 In between the cover 
 And its so white as snow 
 Running through the field 
 Where all my tracks will be concealed 
 When to descend to amend for a friend 
 All the channels that have broken down 
 Now you bring it up Im gonna ring it up 
 Just to hear you sing it out 
 And I do believe what we rely on 
 The more I see the less I know 
 I said hey hey yeah 
 Oh yeah tell my love now 
 Hey hey yeah 
 I said hey oh yeah 
 Hey yeah yeah oh yeahIf I die before I get it done will you decide 
 Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive 
 Because a long time ago I knew not to deprive 
 Its safe out there and now youre everywhere just like the skies 
 You are love you are the love supreme you are the rise 
 And when you hear this you know its your jam its your goodbye 
 Like I said you know Im almost dead you know Im almost gone 
 And when the drummer drums hes gonna play my song to carry me along 
 And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong 
 We all crossed when we were feeling lost its just the tide 
 Katari cried the day her lover died she recognized 
 Because he gave her a life of real love its no surprise 
 The nights are long but the years are short when youre alive 
 Way back when would never be again it was a time 
 Its gonna catch you so glad I met you to walk the line 
 And when the drummer drums hes gonna play my song to carry me along 
 Come get me 
 Hey Hey 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Let me live 
 So when its time to die 
 Even the reaper cries 
 Let me die 
 So when its time to leave 
 Another son will rise
