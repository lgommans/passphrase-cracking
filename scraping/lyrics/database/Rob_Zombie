 Profuse bleeding at the pores, how is this possible

 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Four young chiquitas in Omaha 
 Was waitin' for the band to return from the show 
 Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night 
 The hotel detective, he was out-a-sight 
 Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan 
 They was out to meet the boys in the band 
 They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on," 
 And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

 Hey, hey, hey!This is the story of a one-eyed wolf 
 Called the honey of superdoom 
 She rode her five-legged beast in a mirrored bikini 
 Right out of the womb 
 The chased each other with steam and knives 
 Screaming "Oil is in my veins" 
 And then she grabbed a big ol' pipe 
 And smoked up some fine old monkey brains 
 Get on it 
 Now some say that one-eyed wolf 
 Owned a midget who was almost ten feet tall 
 He spray painted "U.F.O.s are real" 
 In the rubble of the Berlin Wall 
 So finally on that fateful day 
 They went looking for Superman 
 Singing "I'm gonna get my 20 bucks 
 And vacation in Japan" 
 Look out 
 Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's 
 Fucking in a U.F.O 
 Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's 
 Fucking in a U.F.O 
 Get up 
 Get up 
 Get up 
 Get up 
 Get up 
 Now every night this wolf comes a peeping 
 Through filthy glory holes 
 He pounding on a rubber bat 
 And a big ol' jelly roll 
 I said look to the skies 
 I think I saw a spaceship ready to feast 
 But all they had was jizz on the walls 
 And the bones of a mangled priest 
 Look out 
 Now baby doll what do you say 
 When the spaceman comes to town? 
 I think he's got a one-track mind 
 And he likes to boogie down 
 So in the end all that she did 
 Was murder metropolis 
 And show us a big "Fuck the world" 
 Carved right into her chest 
 Look out 
 Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's 
 Fucking in a U.F.O 
 Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's 
 Fucking in a U.F.O 
 Get up

 This idea is sufficiently plausible in an attempt to account 
 For the phenomenon the sickness and the sentence of blood 
 I could no longer struggle every moment threatened to be the last 
 There was pain, dizziness and profuse bleeding at the pores 
 How is this possible? The transmission was transfusing 
 In a moment the sober eye of reason would detect 
 A vibration in the flesh, creeping, incoherent 
 Bearin' no mark of a human hand

 I got a chipped tooth and a dirty tongue 
 Point me to the door while I'm still feeling young
