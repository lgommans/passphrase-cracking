I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for 
 The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor 
 I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the 
 Everyday bullshit things that you have done! 
 Your impossible ego-fuck is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue 
 You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart 
 I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart! 
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
 I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule 
 If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful 
 The only thing you really know about me is... 
 That's all you'll ever know! 
 I know why you blame me 
 I know why you blame yourself 
 I know why you plague me 
 I know why you plague yourself 
 I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell 
 I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself 
 I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it 
 I can't just drop it! 
 I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it 
 At least I admit it! 
 I know why you blame me 
 I know why you blame yourself 
 I know why you plague me 
 I know why you plague 
 yourself! 
 Yeah! 
 Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you 
 (you!) 
 Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you 
 (you!) 
 I can't fucking take it anymore 
 A snap of the synapse and now it's fucking war! 
 Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you 
 (you!) 
 I know why you blame me 
 I know why you blame yourself 
 I know why you plague me 
 I know why you plague yourself 
 I know you blame me... 
 I know why you blame yourself 
 I know why you plague me 
 I know why you 
 plague yourself! 
 I know why you blame yourself! 
 I know why you plague yourself! 
 I know why you plague yourself! 
 I know why you plague yourself!8... 7... 6... 6... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Go... 
 Yeah! 
 I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet 
 Got a super-dread-bet with an angel drug-head 
 Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner 
 An idolized bang for the industry killer 
 I'm curios man, that you don't understand 
 Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap 
 It's suisonic, it's pornaholic 
 Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be 
 If you're 555, then I'm 666! 
 Well if you're 555, I'm 666! 
 Well if you're 555, I'm 
 666! 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 If you're 555, I'm 
 666! 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 Everybody's so infatuated 
 Everybody's so completely sure of what we are 
 Everybody deformates from miles away 
 But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say 
 I bleed for this and I bleed for you 
 Still you look in my face like I'm somebody new 
 Toy; Nobody wants anything I've got 
 Which is fine, because you're made of everything I'm not! 
 If you're 555, then I'm 666! 
 If you're 555, I'm 666! 
 Well if you're 555, I'm 
 666! 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 If you're 555, I'm 
 666! 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 Yeah! 
 Heretic! 
 Yeah! 
 30 seconds, 16, 8, 4, let me tell you why 
 I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest 
 They're listening, clamoring 
 All the money in the world can't buy me! 
 Go ahead and lie to me 
 Tell me again how you're tortured? 
 I wanna know how you followed your orders so well? 
 You're full of shit! 
 You had a dream, but this ain't it! 
 If you're 555, I'm 666! 
 If you're 555, I'm 666... 
 Well if you're 555, I'm 666! 
 If you're 555, I'm 666.. 
 If you're 555, then I'm

 A heretic! 
 Yeah!Even if you will run, I will find you 
 I decided I want you, now I know, I need 
 If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought 
 Keep in mind, I'm with you 
 Never left out fate, can't concentrate 
 Even if you run 
 You will be mine 
 Ah, fucking you will be mine 
 Ah, fucking you will be mine 
 Ah, fucking you will be mine 
 I found you leaning out of an open window 
 You laughed, our fingers clenched 
 Too perfect, far too careless 
 I couldn't help myself, I just took you 
 Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake 
 Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake 
 Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake

 Better make yourself at home, you're here to stay 
 You won't bother me if you let me bother you 
 All the doors are locked, all the windows shut 
 Keep in mind, I watch you 
 Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker 
 Even if you run 
 What the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this 
 And what the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this

 I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave! 
 Better get an army, 'cause the fire left me unscathed 
 You bet your bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile 
 So stick around, 'cause I'll get to you in just a few 
 Step off the "Achtung!", get back or get stung 
 Idiotic sense of yourself; are you that dumb? 
 Entire legion of me, totalitarian 
 The one and only motherfucker; top of the world, man 
 'Cause I can't stand it, planned, gonna crash-land it 
 In other words, consider me branded 
 Another version of me, another version of you 
 Both barrels, what you gonna do? 
 All I hear is human noise! 
 You made your own fucking choice! 
 I belong to only me! 
 Silence for my revelry! 
 I can only die over time! 
 Filthy hands, stay away from mine! 
 Every reason is a right to hate! 
 Painful clutch, death is fine, give me mine! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away!

 Walks away!Did you never give a damn in the first place? 
 Maybe it's time you had the tables turned 
 'Cause in the interest of all involved 
 I got the problem solved and the verdict is guilty 
 Man, nearly killed me, stepping where you fear to tread 
 Stop, drop, and roll, you were dead from the get-go 
 Big motherfucker, stupid cocksucker 
 Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought 
 Always is and never was 
 Foundation made of piss and vinegar 
 Step to me, I'll smear ya, think I fear you, bullshit 
 Just another dumb punk chomping at this tit 
 Is there any way to break through the noise? 
 Was it something that I said that got you bent? 
 Gotta be that way if you want it 
 Sanity, literal profanity, Hit me 
 Spit it out 
 All you wanna do is drag me down 
 All I wanna do is stamp you out 
 Spit it out 
 All you wanna do is drag me down 
 All I wanna do is stamp you out 
 Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder 
 Keeping all your little spies and leaving when you realize 
 Step up, fairy, I guess it's time to bury your ass with a chrome straight to the dome 
 You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter 
 And if you know what's good, just shut up and beg, brother 
 Backstab, don't you know who you're dissing? 
 Sideswipe, we know the ass that you're kissing! 
 Biggety-biggety bitch-boy, halfway hauser 
 Don't hear shit, 'cause it keeps getting louder 
 Come up and you get a face full o' tactic 
 Lipping off hard? Going home in a basket 
 You got no pull, no power, no nothing 
 Now you start shit? Well, ain't that something 
 Payoffs don't protect and you can hide if you want 
 But I'll find you, coming up behind you 
 Spit it out 
 All you wanna do is drag me down 
 All I wanna do is stamp you out 
 Spit it out 
 All you wanna do is drag me down 
 All I wanna do is stamp you out 
 'Bout time I set this record straight 
 All the needle-nose punching is making me irate 
 Sick of my bitching falling on deaf ears 
 Where you gonna be in the next five years? 
 The crew and all the fools and all the politics 
 Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick 
 You got dick when they passed out the good stuff 
 Bam, are you sick of me? Good enough, had enough 
 Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies 
 Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies

 Even now, I realize the time I'll never get 
 Another story of the bitter pills of fate 
 I can't go back again, I can't go back again 
 But you asked me to love you and I did 
 Traded my emotions for a contract to commit 
 And when I got away I only got so far 
 The other me is dead. I hear his voice inside my head 
 We were never alive 
 And we won't be born again 
 But I will never survive 
 With dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 You told me to love you and I did 
 Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit 
 So when I got away, I only kept my scars 
 The other me is gone. Now I don't know where I belong 
 We were never alive 
 And we won't be born again 
 But I'll never survive 
 With dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead visions in your name 
 Dead fingers in my veins 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Dead memories in my heart 
 Oh, ohI've known faces that have disappeared in time 
 Find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime 
 All my friends have pictures made to make you cry 
 I've seen this and wondered what I've done to calcify! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you! 
 We all got left behind, we let it all slip away! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you! 
 We all got left behind, we let it all slip away! 
 I can't stand to see your thalidomide robot face 
 I don't even try it 
 You had to be a liar just to infiltrate me 
 I'm still drowning! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you! 
 We all got left behind, we let it all slip away! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you! 
 We all got left behind, we let it all slip away! 
 Take... this... away 
 Take... this... away 
 I can feel it on my mouth 
 I can taste you on my fingers 
 I can hear you like the holy ghost 
 And kill you if you get too close! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away 
 I come towards you! 
 We all got left behind, we let it all slip away! 
 I ignore you! 
 As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away

 We let it all slip away! 
 We let it all slip away... 
 We let it all slip away... 
 We let it all slip away... 
 Slip away... slip away... slip awayThe ghosts have given up 
 Familiar haunts have had enough 
 Too much thought will give you doubt 
 And now they found you 
 It's safer in a cage 
 They can't tell you what to say 
 All your dreams come with a price 
 So they own you 
 But what did you expect? 
 Was it too much to protect? 
 Did you understand they had selfish intentions? 
 When they were pulling you in opposite directions 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 We are the override 
 Oh, we are the override 
 The dead don't know, the dead are lonely 
 A fascination fades 
 When this mercy execution 
 Says it's over 
 You follow as preferred 
 Now their plans are undeterred 
 Who can bring them in to supersede? 
 It's over 
 Even hate starts out as love 
 Sometimes when it's all you want 
 Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted 
 When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 We are the override 
 Oh, we are the override, yeah 
 You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back 
 Floor to the pedal and lock what you act 
 Covered in sores, you cannot be the one 
 You are the answer to why we have risen 
 You are not the way 
 You are judged to being afraid 
 You are simple and unchanged 
 We believe you should give up 
 Give up 
 Give up 
 God and his mercy will take you for granted 
 When all that's left is the life you abandoned 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 You don't know the hell that's coming 
 Everybody get on the ground 
 We are the override 
 Oh, we are the override, yeah 
 Give up

 I'm gonna burn so I better tell you everything 
 The competition, the superstition 
 Nevermind, 'cause you're never gonna give in 
 It's a crisis, just how you like it 
 The same drama in a different disguise 
 I'm bound to walk with a target on my back 
 At least I'm ready for another attack 
 The Lord of lies 
 The morning star 
 You had to be set free 
 Opposing sides 
 Your choices are 
 The negative one and me, yeah 
 Svengali; Why are we the enemies? 
 I never follow but I never make apologies 
 Your dementias are gonna getcha 
 Because your walls can't support each other 
 Settle for the cynical, you're so political 
 You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical 
 Reciprocity, somebody's listening 
 What did we learn from our time in captivity? 
 The Lord of lies 
 The morning star 
 You had to be set free 
 Opposing sides 
 Your choices are 
 The negative one and me 
 The negative one and me 
 I hope you live to see the day 
 When you're world goes up in flames 
 And as you die you see my face 
 You're the only one to blame, yeah 
 Fuck 
 Yeah 
 The prescient, the nascent, the quotient 
 (they all will fall) 
 The cystic symbolic condition 
 (systemic) 
 Egregious, replete with these lesions 
 (contaminate) 
 Succumb to the selfish creation 
 (your failure) 
 Yeah 
 No accountability, divisibility 
 I point a finger but it's always looking back at me 
 The centipede's pulling on the mechanism 
 Unearthing scars of the cataclysm 
 When the innocent begin to circumvent 
 The colour fades, but the picture is vibrant 
 What do you believe? Does it matter now? 
 Turn away, the killer is disavowed 
 The Lord of lies 
 The morning star 
 You had to be set free 
 Opposing sides 
 Your choices are 
 The negative one and me

 I hope you live to see the day

 Yeah! 
 Drop it! 
 Bones in the water and dust in my lungs! 
 Absorbing, archaic, like a sponge... 
 The ultimate way is the way you control it! 
 But can you stay if you detach your soul! 
 Bury the present and squeeze out the past! 
 The ones who endear to never last... 
 Chemical burns and the animalistic 
 I'm just another hard-line pseudo-statistic! 
 Can you feel this? 
 (Oh, can you feel this?) 
 I'm dying to feel this! 
 (I'm dying to feel this...) 
 Can you feel this? 
 (Oh, can you feel this?) 
 Blood in the paper and skin on my teeth... 
 Trying to commit to what's beneath! 
 To find the time is to lose the momentum! 
 You learn the lessons and immediately forget them 
 Automatic and out of my reach! 
 Consult all the waste to find the key... 
 Minimal life and the polysyllabic 
 I'm just another blank page, push the button pull the rage! 
 Can you feel this? 
 (Oh, can you feel this?) 
 I'm dying to feel this! 
 (I'm dying to feel this...) 
 Can you feel this? 
 (Oh, can you feel this?) 
 I am all, but what am I? 
 Another number that isn't equal to any of you! 
 I control, but I comply 
 Pick me apart, then pick up the pieces 
 I'm uneven! 
 I am the damaged one, all my life and the damage done! 
 I am the damaged one, all my life and the damage done!

 And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker 
 This is the end of everything 
 You are the end of everything 
 Shallow skin, I can paint with pain 
 I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain 
 Everyday it's the same; I love, you hate 
 But I guess I don't care anymore 
 Oh, fix my problems with the blade 
 While my eyes turn from blue to gray 
 God, the worst thing happened to me today 
 But I guess I don't care anymore? Wrong 
 (Fuck) 
 You are wrong, fucked and overrated

 This is the end of everything 
 You are the end of everything 
 My flaws are the only thing left that's pure 
 Can't really live, can't really endure 
 Everything I see reminds me of her 
 God, I wish I didn't care anymore 
 The more I touch, the less I feel 
 I'm lying to myself that it's not real 
 Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal? 
 It's never gonna appear anymore 
 You are wrong, fucked and overrated 
 Think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault 
 This is the end of everything

 Suffer 
 What the hell am I doing? 
 Is there anyone left in my life? 
 What the fuck was I thinking? 
 Anybody want to tell me I'm fine? 
 Where the hell am I going? 
 Do I even need a reason to hide? 
 I am only betrayed 
 I am only conditioned to die 
 You are wrong, fucked and overrated

 NoShe's sticking needles in her skin 
 I turn with an ugly grin 
 Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy 
 But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines 
 It's so confusing, the methods that she's using 
 She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see 
 Will she ever find, one million of a kind? 
 It's cold and lonely but that's because she told me 
 Lost inside her dirty world 
 No one hurts this pretty girl but her 
 Oh, she's beautiful 
 A little better than a man deserves 
 Ooh, I'm not insane 
 Please tell me she won't change 
 Maybe I should let her go 
 But only when she loves me 
 (She loves me) 
 How can I just let her go? 
 Not until she loves me 
 (She loves me) 
 She's drowning in herself again 
 My God, what a lovely sin 
 I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way 
 She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes 
 She smiles and answers; it doesn't seem to matter 
 Lost inside my dirty head 
 Something tells me I'm the one who's kept 
 Loud, so volatile 
 A little better than her mind defiled 
 Who I need to be 
 Please tell me she won't change 
 Maybe I should let her go 
 But only when she loves me 
 (She loves me) 
 How can I just let her go? 
 Not until she loves me 
 (She loves me) 
 We were meant to be together 
 Now die and fucking love me 
 We were made to hate each other 
 Now die and fucking love me 
 Die and fucking love me 
 Die and fucking love me 
 Die and fucking love meThe whole world is my enemy and I'm a walking target 
 Two times the devil with all the significance 
 Dragged and raped for the love of a mob 
 I can't stay, because I can't be stopped 
 Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us 
 I know you're all tired of the same old bosses 
 Let me tell you how it's gonna be 
 I'm gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me 
 Welcome to the same old fucking scam 
 Same old shit in a dead fad 
 Everybody wants to be so hard 
 Are you real or a second rate sports card? 
 They all lost their Dad or their wife just died 
 They never got to go outside; Shut up 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 It doesn't change the fact that you suck! 
 We are 
 The anti-cancer 
 We are 
 The only answer 
 Stripped down, we want you dead 
 But what's inside of me, you'll never know! 
 We are 
 Bipolar gods 
 We are 
 You know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And I don't think I need this anymore 
 Now I'm not pretty and I'm not cool 
 But I'm fat, I'm ugly and proud, so fuck you! 
 Standing out is the new pretension 
 Streamline the sickness, half-assed aggression 
 You gotta see it to believe it, we all got conned 
 All the mediocre sacred cows we've spawned 
 Put your trust in the mission 
 We will not repent, this is our religion! 
 We are 
 The anti-cancer 
 We are 
 The only answer 
 Stripped down, we want you dead 
 But what's inside of me, you'll never know! 
 We are 
 Bipolar gods 
 We are 
 You know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And I don't think I need this anymore 
 I am hated! 
 You are hated! 
 We are hated! 
 I am hated! 
 Everything sucks and I can prove it 
 Everybody dies, shuffle on, remove it 
 Individuals, indispensable 
 I'm the paradox deity vessel 
 The other side holds no secret 
 But this side is done, I don't need it 
 Before you go, you should know you're breaking down 
 You'll be rotten by the time you're underground! 
 Fuck you... 
 We are 
 The anti-cancer 
 We are 
 The only answer 
 Stripped down, we want you dead 
 But what's inside of me, you'll never know! 
 We are 
 Bipolar gods 
 We are 
 You know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And I don't think I need this anymore 
 We are 
 The source of conscience 
 We are 
 Distorted sentients 
 There's only one thing left 
 And I can't leave until it's sated 
 We are 
 The absolute 
 We are 
 Controlling you 
 They're closing in, I can't escape 
 I am hated!Kill Me! 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 That's where my soul is worn... 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 That's when I was born... 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 I broke away from me 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 I knocked me to my knees! 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 I drink my own cells... 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 A decomposing well... 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 Roaches in my head... 
 Tattered and Torn! 
 I become the living dead!

 Pentex sucks, Pentex sucks! 
 They burn the life force of my tribe 
 Pentex sucks! 
 Bonegnawers suck, bonegnawers suck! 
 They roll around in garbage bins 
 All bonegnawers suck! 
 (Pentex breeding, night is darkening) 
 The Black Hand sucks, the Black Hand sucks! 
 Those wyrm tainted bastard leeches, Black Hand sucks! 
 If I had my way! If I had my way! 
 I'd rend them all, ripped and torn 
 All that sucks dies! 
 (Sweet smell bleeding, glow is melting me) 
 I bring my klave into battle 
 Shifting into Crinos 
 I slay Wyrmfoe, then I step sideways...

 You're mine 
 (I know who you are)There's God 
 Can I feed you again? 
 Will I have to stay dumb? 
 You can feel and it begins 
 But I know inside this heart attack 
 I can see through your eyes 
 I'm terrified of everything 
 But it's no real surprise 
 Because the parasites are dancing closer 
 All this sacrilegion warns in posters 
 Can you handle it? 
 In the dark 
 Why I think I'm alone 
 I swept through my visions 
 I'm going too cold 
 Today is a tragedy 
 In the mouth of the mad 
 But that doesn't matter now 
 I've come home relaxed 
 I'm curled up in a ball and shaking 
 I'm hiding from the hell I'm making 
 I can't believe the chance I'm taking 
 Is there any other way? 
 Is there any other way? 
 The burden 
 The burden 
 (You can't save me) 
 There is nothing more to give 
 (I am changing) 
 Almost like I never lived 
 (Be my witness) 
 Just don't leave me in suspense 
 (Keep this, prove it) 
 Tell them all the consequences 
 The burden 
 (Have you ever been burdened before?) 
 The burden 
 (Was there anything you wanted more?) 
 (You can't save me) 
 There is nothing more to give 
 (I am changing) 
 Almost like I never lived 
 (Be my witness) 
 Just don't leave me in suspense 
 (Keep this, prove it) 
 Tell them all the consequences 
 Our same plea 
 By now you know that looks are deceiving 
 I'm covered in a rash and receding 
 Is there any other way? 
 Is there any other way?

 Too tragic to stay with you... 
 Too static to try for you... 
 These scars, they swallow hard 
 The part of the past that's hollow and dark... 
 Too horrid to kill for you... 
 Too sordid to die with you... 
 Unstable as always, come down 
 Everything else is just dust and sound! 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way! 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way 
 See the shape, broken and thrown away! 
 I'd give it all away, come take it all away 
 You can't resent the fear 
 Somebody tell me how I got here 
 I'd give it all to you 
 Come take it, it's all for you 
 The noise is so damn loud 
 But everything else is just dust and sound! 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way! 
 Separate! 
 I've lost my only way 
 See the shape, broken and thrown away! 
 I don't wanna do this anymore! 
 Everything's shit! 
 Everything's been taken; Forsaken 
 Gotta start it over 'cause I'm hearing it backwards 
 Don't make sense, don't feel better! 
 Who's better? It's not that simple! 
 You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult! 
 It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy 
 Draw your conclusions; Solutions? 
 Everybody else wanna run? 
 Contorting, distorting; I am undone 
 One less propaganda nightmare fixture 
 Are you getting the picture? 
 Separate!

 Yeah!"Thou shalt not" 
 Kill your fathers, destroy another life 
 Question everything we clung to for years 
 Live forever, design a better death 
 Confuse a liar with a savior from fear. 
 Create a myth and separate the chosen ones 
 Adolescent independence dominion 
 I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything 
 But now my conscience is contradicting everything. 
 The ending's the same 
 The world will not change 
 The answer is clear. 
 Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters 
 Blame yourselves because your children are mine 
 We are orphans, but we are not forgotten 
 And we will find a way to save us this time. 
 We can run, but we are tired of runnin' 
 We're droppin' seconds in a glass 'til we die 
 We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything 
 But we're alive and we're not accepting anything. 
 The ending's the same 
 The world will not change 
 The answer is clear 
 Annihilation. 
 I won't control or restrain things I do not understand 
 Now I realize I'm stronger, better 
 They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had 
 Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more. 
 We have to save ourselves. 
 We have to save ourselves. 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 Oh, I will never become another piece 
 Inside the paralytic construct I hate. 
 Live forever? Well, I would rather die 
 At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create. 
 This is yours, but you had better choose 
 Before they take away your right to decide 
 I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything 
 But my solace is, I can handle everything. 
 The ending's the same 
 The world will not change 
 The answer is clear 
 Obliteration. 
 I won't control or restrain things I do not understand 
 Now I realize I'm stronger, better 
 They gave to me, now I give to you 
 The means to burn the thoughts I had 
 Now I realize I'm stronger, better. 
 I won't control or restrain things I do not understand

 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves! 
 We have to save ourselves!(Yeah) 
 I can see you, but you can't see me 
 I could touch you and you wouldn't even feel me 
 Wait a second and you'll settle down 
 I'm just waiting till you really let your guard down 
 You're relaxed, you're sublime, you're amazing 
 You don't even know the danger you're facing 
 If I'm quiet, I'll slide up behind you 
 And if you hear me, I'll enjoy trying to find you 
 I've been with you all day 
 I'm trying to stay calm 
 I'm impatient and it's really hard to breathe 
 I'm going to empty you and fill you in with me 
 Just keep the violence down 
 Not yet, don't make a sound 
 Oh, God, I'm feeling it 
 It's reaching fever pitch 
 My skin is caving in 
 My heart is driving out 
 No mercy, no remorse 
 Let nature take its course 
 (Watching) Bring me to my knees 
 (Waiting) I am your disease 
 (Lover) Set my symptom free 
 (Covered) You can't stop me 
 (Wait, no, wait, wait, no, wait, wait, not yet, no wait, wait) 
 I'm sweating through my veins 
 I'm trying to hold on 
 It's unbearable; it's almost worst for me 
 I'm gonna tear you apart and make you see 
 Make you see 
 (Watching) Bring me to my knees 
 (Waiting) I am your disease 
 (Lover) Set my symptom free 
 (Covered) You can't stop me 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is inside us, the crisis, the knife 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is inside us, the crisis, the knife 
 It's almost time to play 
 It's time to be afraid 
 I can't control the pain 
 I can't control in vain 
 Oh, God, I'm ready now 
 You're almost ready now 
 I'm gonna love you now 
 I'm gonna put you down 
 I see you in the dark 
 I see you all the way 
 I see you in the light 
 I see you plain as day 
 I wanna touch your face 
 I wanna touch your soul 
 I wanna wear your face 
 I wanna burn your soul 
 (Watching) Bring me to my knees 
 (Waiting) I am your disease 
 (Lover) Set my symptom free 
 (Covered) You can't stop me 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of life 
 This is the virus, the virus of lifeMeet the man that made me, greet the can I came from 
 Motherfucking sacred heart of Jesus 
 Blew it in the back room, feeling like a real goon 
 Slam the fuck aside, man, I'm on, you're not 
 I am the great big mouth 
 I am the great big mouth 
 Burn 
 Good riddance, though I'm sad to say 
 I didn't get to kill you 
 Rhetoric, better look both ways 
 I gotta get an arm through 
 Stain 
 What the fuck is up? Get the fuck away 
 Run if you want to 
 Innocent? You're a guilty conscience 
 I jam that blade through 
 Stain 
 Prepare you, fucker 
 (Even though I won't ask him...) 
 Prepare you, fucker 
 (Even though I won't ask him...) 
 Prepare you, fucker 
 (Even though I won't ask him...) 
 Prepare you, fucker 
 I don't give a shit, bitch 
 I don't give a fuck, bitch 
 I don't understand this, you don't matter 
 I don't give a fuck, man 
 I don't give a shit, man 
 I don't really care, man 
 I'm the super-sized man 
 Fuck, fuck You 
 You're fucked 
 I am the great big mouth 
 Fucking stupid fuck! 
 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! 
 Stupid fuck 
 God, fucking stupid fuck 
 Stupid fuck 
 Fuck! Stop! 
 Fuck, stupid fuck 
 Take that motherfuckerI am the product of your conduct 
 The uncontrollable urges that made me 
 Have made us all, Are you proud? Do you even care? 
 You taught us all to lie; that's how we made it here 
 You should've buried the truth with your secrets 
 But you were far too impressed with your pretense 
 Now, as far as I know, I don't know anything 
 'Cause you made damn sure I wasn't anything 
 Distractions, reactions 
 The only way to go is to go away 
 Discarded, retarded 
 Before I let you go, you have to let me 
 Clawed away from human clay 
 We are the broken shards; the art disarray 
 Before you condemn, you rape them 
 (Feed us meconium) 
 Stunt our growth from our souls to our throats, Cut! 
 You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy 
 But you did; now you're only growing enemies 
 This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed 
 'Cause you made damn sure 
 Now we're everything 
 Distractions, reactions 
 The only way to go is to go away 
 Discarded, retarded 
 Before I let you go, you have to let me 
 Much to my surprise, I will wake up 
 And follow the path of the ones I am made of 
 But this time, I won't give in 
 I will save you from my sins 
 (What is wrong with this manipulation, violence, chaotic?) 
 Ensconced in all that's wrong 
 I slam you shut; I can only take so much 
 How many times do I have to mistreat you? 
 Constantly biting my hand as I feed you 
 Maybe now you'll understand severity 
 I'll sum it up with the best amount of brevity 
 Welcome to the transformation 
 Welcome to annihilation 
 Welcome to the man that wanted 
 Everything, but couldn't have it 
 Distractions, reactions 
 The only way to go is to go away 
 Discarded, retarded 
 Before I let you go, you have to let me 
 Much to my surprise, I will wake up 
 And follow the path of the ones I am made of 
 But this time, I won't give in 
 I will save you from my sins 
 Save you from my sins! 
 Save you from my sins!Let's skip all the histrionics 
 Not again, not another excuse 
 The epidemic is co-dependent 
 Biting off more than your mouth can chew 
 Don't forget to convalesce your secrets 
 I don't want to be a man today 
 For all you know I'm the silver in the bullet 
 I am the trigger that will make you all obey 
 I'm going to make you cry tonight 
 I'm going to make you hate me 
 Inside all my flaws again 
 (I can't let go) 
 In spite of you I'm lost again 
 (I still don't know) 
 Disguises show me, what am I if I am only? 
 The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home 
 Your association finds you guilty 
 Starting with the end of the day 
 Black and white is such a fascist feeling 
 Right or wrong and nothing to say 
 The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints 
 Unappreciated medical fiends 
 Confiscate another classic inbred 
 Fuck it all, light the acetylene 
 No other choice, I can't explain 
 Life keeps taking things away 
 Inside all my flaws again 
 (I can't let go) 
 In spite of you I'm lost again 
 (I still don't know) 
 Disguises show me, what am I if I am only? 
 The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home 
 The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage. 
 The future's here, I'm past my prime 
 When the evidence came, I committed the crime 
 Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible 
 Who could ask for a better disciple 
 What's the point, I'm not sure I can 
 I'll never dig another grave, I'm afraid of what I'll find 
 If it hurts, then you're too old 
 I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold 
 I'm going to make you cry tonight 
 I need you to hate me 
 Inside all my flaws again 
 (I can't let go) 
 In spite of you I'm lost again 
 (I still don't know) 
 This life has shown me, why am I here? Sad and lonely 
 The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home 
 But now it feels like homeCycle of life and death supposedly 
 Goes round and round yet it stops with me 
 Glorious Hunter of my faith I have sinned 
 Killers are quiet like the breath of the wind 
 Filling the shadows with forms of my own 
 Raised by kindred of get I was born 
 Abomination world in disarray 
 Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae 
 Reflection beckons a portal shard 
 Spiritual quest I must stay on guard 
 Stepping sideways betweens worlds I shift 
 Killers are quiet when they are born with the gift 
 Beautiful anguish cast out by my race 
 Now one that's ageless I save my own face 
 I write my own laws with death I break bread 
 Killers are quiet when they come from my head.Come on! 
 Here we go again, motherfucker! 
 Yeah! 
 Come on down and see the idiot right here 
 Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care 
 What's the matter with calamity anyway? 
 Right? Get the fuck outta my face 
 Understand that I can't feel anything 
 It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay 
 I feel like a wound, like I've got a fucking 
 Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead! 
 One more time, motherfucker! 
 Everybody hates me now, so fuck it... 
 Blood's on my face and my hands and I don't know why 
 I'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business! 
 Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it! 
 Spin it around so I can spit in its face 
 I wanna leave without a trace 
 'Cause I don't wanna die in this place! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 Whatcha gonna do? 
 People equal shit! 
 Cause I'm not afraid of you! 
 People equal shit! 
 I'm everything you'll never be! 
 People equal shit! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Come on! 
 It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone 
 Contagion; I'm sitting at the side of Satan 
 What do you want from me? 
 They never told me the failure I was meant to be 
 Yeah? Overdo it; Don't tell me; You blew it? 
 Stop your bitching and fight your way through it 
 I'm not like you, I just fuck up 
 Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die 
 Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit! 
 People equal shit!

 Whatcha gonna do? 
 People equal shit! 
 Cause I'm not afraid of you! 
 People equal shit! 
 I'm everything you'll never be! 
 People equal shit! 
 Yeah! 
 Goddammn right!I'm cold, I'm ugly 
 I'm always confused by everything 
 I can stare into a thousand eyes 
 But every smile hides a bold-faced lie 
 It itches, it seethes; It festers and breathes 
 My heroes are dead, they died in my head 
 Thin out the herd and squeeze out the pain 
 Something inside me has opened up again 
 Thoughts of me exemplified 
 All the real flaws I have denied 
 Forget today, forget whatever happened 
 Every day, I see a little more overall deficiencies 
 I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 I save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
 Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
 Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens 
 I decrease while my symptoms increase 
 God, what the fuck is wrong? 
 You act like you knew it all along 
 Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing 
 All I ever wanted out of you was something you could never be 
 Now take a real good look at what you've fucking done to me 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 "I haven't got time for the living; I haven't got time for the living" 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 (boy) 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 (boy) 
 Give me any reason not to fuck you up 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 (bitch) 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 Give me any reason why I'd need you 
 (bitch) 
 Give me any reason not to fuck you up 
 I see you in me, I see you in me 
 I see you in me, I see you in me 
 I see you in me, I see you in me 
 I see you in me, I see you in me 
 I keep my scars from prying eyes 
 Incapable of ever knowing why 
 Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer 
 Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things 
 But I don't care what you think, you'll never understand me 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 What the hell did I do to deserve all of this? 
 FuckDo you believe? Do you fade like a Dream? 
 Let me hear you breathe 
 Let me watch as you sleep 
 The sparrow's eyes... Promises shift into judgments 
 I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments 
 The blood and the body 
 Control the cut so it's seamless 
 Show me your heart 
 Show me the way to complete this 
 Tethered to a scene I treasure; can you help me? 
 I sever God; it's perfect, it's never really perfect 
 Now... I can finally be myself 
 'Cause I don't want to be myself 
 Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it 
 (I don't want to be myself) 
 I cannot maintain 
 A semblance of normal anymore 
 I'd rather feel pain 
 Than try to fit in with you anymore 
 I'll throw it all away 
 Like everybody else 
 I can finally be myself 
 'Cause I don't want to be myself 
 Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it 
 (I don't want to be myself)Hit the goddamn wall

 Fuck it all, fuck this world 
 Fuck everything that you stand for 
 Don't belong, don't exist

 Dripping hole, man, hard step, no fate 
 Show you nothing, but I ain't holding back 
 Every damn word I say is a sneak attack 
 When I get my hands on you 
 Ain't a fucking thing you can do 
 Get this, 'cause you're never gonna get me 
 I am the very disease you pretend to be 
 I am the push that makes you move 
 I am the push that makes you move 
 I am the push that makes you move 
 I am the push that makes you move 
 Fuck it all, fuck this world 
 Fuck everything that you stand for 
 Don't belong, don't exist 
 Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me 
 Fuck it all, fuck this world 
 Fuck everything that you stand for 
 Don't belong, don't exist 
 Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me 
 "No" 
 BurnIt's been years since anyone could be a friend 
 It's the fear that kills the feeling, in the end 
 Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die? 
 If rain is what you want, all you have to do is close your eyes 
 Just close your eyes 
 I am watching resurrections start to crawl 
 Is there any chance in Hell? Any chance at all? 
 Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there? 
 If rain is what you want, then take your seats, enjoy the fall 
 Enjoy the fall 
 The only thing deeper than my last breath 
 The only thing darker than my last death 
 Is the panic, the static 
 I've come back from the dead 
 But my cities will never sleep again 
 In these diamonds we're left with coloured glass 
 As pressure takes its toll, we will outlast 
 But you can't break my heart 
 As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart 
 And you can't take me in 
 If I'm not broken, break me down 
 So I will never feel alone again 
 The only thing deeper than my last breath 
 The only thing darker than my last death 
 Is the panic, the static 
 I've come back from the dead 
 But my cities 
 (will never sleep again) 
 My cities will never sleep again 
 My cities will never sleep again 
 My cities will never sleep again 
 My cities will never sleep againBury all your secrets in my skin 
 Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins 
 The air around me still feels like a cage 
 And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again 
 So if you love me let me go 
 And run away before I know 
 My heart is just too dark to care 
 I can't destroy what isn't there 
 Deliver me unto my fate 
 If I'm alone I cannot hate 
 I don't deserve to have you 
 Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know 
 I still press your letters to my lips 
 And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss 
 I couldn't face a life without your light (without your light) 
 But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight 
 So save your breath I will not hear 
 I think I made it very clear 
 You couldn't hate enough to love 
 Is that supposed to be enough 
 I only wish you weren't my friend 
 Then I could hurt you in the end 
 I never claimed to be a saint 
 Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go 
 Oh oh 
 So break yourself against my stones 
 And spit your pity in my soul 
 You never needed any help 
 You sold me out to save yourself 
 And I won't listen to your shame 
 You ran away you're all the same 
 Angels lie to keep control 
 Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know 
 If you still care don't ever let me knowCome on! 
 Somebody give me some light 
 Not pointed into dark 
 Somebody show me the end 
 Not trying to push the start 
 I'm trying to figure out 
 A better way, a better answer 
 But I keep finding all the problems 
 I've been looking after 
 You can wander through the world 
 With nothing but a smile 
 I'll take your tongue for words 
 And use it to instill denial 
 Don't get close 
 You don't know me 
 And you'll never know 
 Chivalry, will get you somewhere 
 Rivalry, will take you there 
 Don't get close 
 You don't know me 
 And you'll never know 
 Chivalry, will get you somewhere 
 Rivalry, will take you there 
 Maybe I should look away 
 Before I really miss 
 Maybe I should pick the time 
 Before I pick the place 
 I bet you all the things 
 That you emulate, you penalize 
 But I don't wanna go 
 Until you learn to finalize 
 Don't get close 
 You don't know me 
 And you'll never know 
 Chivalry, will get you somewhere 
 Rivalry, will take you there 
 Don't get close 
 You don't know me 
 And you'll never know 
 Chivalry, will get you somewhere 
 Rivalry 
 You ascertain the plot 
 My vision's overshot 
 I have the best confection 
 I was gone for all the lessons 
 Who coined these words I use 
 Stay out and be abused 
 I didn't want to be 
 The undeniable source of everything 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Waiting, watching all the conflicts 
 Constrict, just to fit in, squeeze in 
 I cannot resist, claws and fist 
 Remember, remember 
 You take the rivalries 
 And never made much sense 
 I have the worst possession 
 What I want is so insensitive 
 Stay out and be abused 
 Cause this is so confused 
 I only want to be 
 Left alone, now run away 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Don't get close 
 You'd better stay away 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah!I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Good bye 
 I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
 Everything is 3-D blasphemy 
 My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
 This is not the way I pictured me 
 I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? 
 Something about this, so very wrong 
 I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
 Is it a dream or a memory? 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Get outta my head, 'cause I don't need this 
 Why didn't I see this? 
 But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate 
 I have sinned by just making my mind up and taking your breath away 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Good bye 
 You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing 
 My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free 
 You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing 
 My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 And it waits for youGently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure... 
 A pleasure that will take my mind off the realities of my life... 
 My past life... 
 Life as I know it now! 
 And whatever may come, it slowly disappears! 
 To somewhere in the back of my mind... 
 And it will remain there... till I wish to retrieve it! 
 Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break! 
 A break from the pressures of life! 
 And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands! 
 Life's hands! 
 This mode is incredible! It's out of this world! 
 Too bad I must always leave it... 
 That's life 
 That's Life... 
 That's life 
 That's Life... 
 That's life 
 That's Life... 
 That's life 
 That's Life... 
 Shift... Shift... Shift... Shift... Shift...This song is not for the living 
 This song is for the dead 
 With my face against the floor 
 I can't see who knocked me out of the way 
 I don't want to get back up 
 But I have to, so it might as well be today 
 Nothing appeals to me, no one feels like me 
 I'm too busy being calm to disappear 
 I'm in no shape to be alone 
 Contrary to the shit that you might hear 
 So walk with me, walk with me 
 Don't let the symbolism kill your heart 
 Walk with me, walk with me 
 Just like we should have done right from the start 
 Walk with me, walk with me 
 Don't let this fucking world tear you apartKill it 
 Tattered and torn 
 Something aches 
 Tattered and torn 
 Bad things slither 
 Tattered and torn 
 My floors are burning down 
 Tattered and torn 
 And I can't find a window 
 Tattered and torn 
 This is medieval 
 Tattered and torn 
 This is cerebral 
 Tattered and torn 
 Suffocated 
 Tattered and torn 
 Melodramatic 
 Tattered and torn 
 Driven to the verge of

 Forty years ago, The Man proclaimed the Age of the Gross to be upon us, and even though the 
 Man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence, 
 That era has become very real. 
 We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure. 
 My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust. 
 Some have fought and died. 
 Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about 
 And will never understand. 
 I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is 
 Not mankind 
 . 
 Distrust in information. 
 Fundamentalism of opinion. 
 Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter. 
 Where is your glory now, people? 
 Where are your gods and politicians? 
 Where is your shame and salvation? 
 You Rage For No Reason Because You Have No Reason. 
 What have you ever fought for? 
 What have you ever bled for? 
 The face of the earth is scared with the walking dead. 
 The age of the gross is a living virus. 
 This is the future you have created. 
 This is the world you have set ablaze. 
 All your lies are coming true. 
 All Freedom Is Lost. 
 All Hope Is Gone.I know why Judas wept, motherfucker! 
 The fire's burn on the summit 
 Shining a light on the ones I've killed 
 Survivors' guilt undetermined 
 I can murder the world in all the blood I've spilled 
 Banishment, sequestered and conquered 
 To hell with your intelligence 
 Just figure out your common sense 
 No one is bulletproof 
 Yeah 
 I'll eat the skins of my brothers 
 The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall 
 Can I fill in the cracks with these feelings 
 With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all 
 Selfishness, take granted for everything 
 What more could you ask for? 
 It doesn't matter anymore 
 No one is bulletproof 
 Yeah 
 Can you feel the cold? 
 Fortune never favors the old 
 Tired of defending myself 
 Go complain to somebody else 
 Somebody else 
 Yeah 
 The monsters in your madness are the voices in your head 
 They're scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed 
 You live like fucking heathens, so you'll die like pagan Gods 
 In between the poisons and the pure 
 Contagions and the cure 
 NINE - FOR - SURE 
 NINE - FOR - SURE 
 NINE - FOR - SURE 
 NINE - FOR - SURE 
 I got a bone that's dead inside of me 
 It's a rotting sink that I don't need 
 Feel free to vent your denigration 
 I can't believe I'm saying this 
 I'll live with my regrets 
 I'll die by my decisions 
 I'm not your fucking superstar 
 Keep it close, you're going way too far 
 No one is bulletproof 
 Bulletproof 
 No one is bulletproof 
 Bulletproof 
 No one is bulletproof 
 BulletproofUndo these chains, my friend 
 I'll show you the rage I've hidden 
 Perish the sacrament 
 Swallow, but nothing's forgiven 
 You and I can't decide 
 Which of us was taken for granted 
 Make amends, some of us 
 Are destined to be outlived 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 Too many times we've let it come to this 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore 
 Under the words of men 
 Something is tempting the father 
 Where is your will, my friend? 
 Insatiates never even bother 
 You and I, wrong or right 
 Traded a lie for the leverage 
 In between the lens in light 
 You're not what you seem 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 Too many times we've let it come to this 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 You'll realize I'm not your Devil 
 I'm not your Devil anymore 
 Your station is abandoned 
 Fooled you, 'cause I know what you've done 
 Sensation, deprivation 
 You should've burned when you turned on everyone 
 So step inside; see the Devil in I 
 Too many times we've let it come to this 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 I know you'll find your answers in the end 
 Step inside; see the Devil in I 
 You'll realize I'm not your Devil 
 (Anymore) 
 So step inside, step inside 
 See the Devil in I, see the Devil in IZero and zero is nothing but zero... 
 The cancer and people conspired together... 
 Running and running and going forever... 
 Collected and sampled, starving for zero... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine! 
 Minus the inside and minus the circle 
 Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel 
 And wherein and herein, between us and near us 
 And zero and zero is nothing but zero 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine... 
 Come see my cage, built in migraine!

 You can't feel the flow because you died, face-down on a suicide 
 The motherfucker's on self-destruct, nobody guarding your back, it's all a front 
 Save this, my rage is bliss, I'm taking names and getting pissed 
 Where's Chuck D when you need him? 
 You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread 
 The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it 
 Man, it's funny that you scare me so, just enough to fuck me up again and again 
 Hard life is hard as hell, better back the fuck on up, 'cause this is- 
 No kind of life, this is no kind of life 
 (I've got to get out) 
 It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life 
 (You can't blame me) 
 Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone 
 Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own 
 Bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win 
 Breathe, amber-cult, breathe, one more, seethe, freak like you got a pair 
 Won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a no-good life, this is- 
 No kind of life, this is no kind of life 
 (I've got to get out) 
 It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life 
 (You can't blame me) 
 I can't remember, I don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way? 
 Carry it with you till someone forgives you, I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say 
 You can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here 
 None of us wonder what weather you're under, you're making it perfectly clear 
 Lights ain't on, shit ain't right, never had peace, but I gotta fight 
 Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall? 
 Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
 You're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight 
 The feelings, the question, the price is too human for fucking sake, this is- 
 No kind of life, this is no kind of life 
 (I've got to get out) 
 It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me 
 I can't be, I can't be, I can't be blamedWallow in the winter of it 
 Discover what you truly covet 
 Underneath and far above it 
 You slither in all kinds of shit 
 How could you forget about it? 
 Did you think you could minimize? 
 This is the age of consent 
 You'll get a day in the sun before I kill your fucking lights 
 Burn up in your atmosphere 
 Burn up in your utmost fear 
 Desecrate your temples 
 Only Hell and hate remain 
 Don't look for crows to scatter 
 Prepare for Judgement Day 
 We are kill gods! 
 The kings are falling down 
 Can I find a way to get there? 
 Bury your head in the ground 
 Will you falsify for your fair share? 
 When it's done, it's done - plus negative one 
 It's everybody's guess but the apathy won 
 Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion 
 Or will you settle for oblivion? 
 We are kill gods! 
 (We) 
 We make this world worth saving 
 (Are) 
 Are you prepared to believe? 
 (Kill) 
 Kill everything that kills you 
 (Gods) 
 Live long and die for me 
 Yeah 
 Rape crutch and stick in the middle 
 Of an evidence bag that'll never obey 
 All these years spent hiding all the bodies 
 I could never be sure, but I remember the graves 
 We are kill gods! 
 (We) 
 We make this world worth saving 
 (Are) 
 Are you prepared to believe? 
 (Kill) 
 Kill everything that kills you

 Live long and die for me 
 You! 
 Live long and die for me 
 Live long and die for meWelcome out 
 Mother Nature is a coward 
 (Mother Nature is a whore) 
 No more presence, no more power 
 (I pray for death by the hour) 
 Cut another smile into me 
 (Into me is all you are) 
 My artifice won't recognize me 
 (You won't find me) 
 anymore 
 Posttraumatic war machines 
 The pessimists still won't believe 
 Throw away my past mistakes 
 It's all I can to feel 
 Let my weapons be your children 
 Let my armies be your damned 
 Try to suffer on in silence 
 Try to stop me if you can 
 Pneumatic destroyer 
 Pathetic seducer 
 Distortion sufficient 
 Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again 
 My ghosts have found their way back home 
 I have every right to kill my own 
 (I have every right to kill my own) 
 I am something now that never could exist 
 My anguish conquers all; pay the price and watch me fall 
 My only key is broken-my broken key is only... Me 
 Pneumatic destroyer 
 Pathetic seducer 
 Distortion sufficient 
 Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again 
 You utter waste of tired flesh 
 It doesn't matter if you can't progress 
 Even now, they still create me 
 Give me your ignorance; irritate me 
 I am made of the same debris 
 You want it all, but you didn't want me 
 Hypocrite with no real use 
 I'm alive; what's your excuse? 
 We'll live our lives againPain 
 "Here comes the pain" 
 Enemy, show me what you wanna be 
 I can handle anything, even if I can't handle you 
 Readily, either way, it better be 
 Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off 
 What the hell am I saying? 
 I don't know about malevolent 
 Sure as hell decadent 
 I want somebody to step up, step off 
 Walls, let me fall, fuck you all 
 Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball 
 Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
 You're going down, this is a war 
 Fuck it 
 Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind? 
 You're leaving me suspect? I'm leaving you grotesque 
 Feels like a burn from which you never learn 
 Cause and effect, you jealous ass 
 Press your face against the glass, suffer 
 Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
 You're going down, this is a war 
 Go 
 I've just begun 
 It's about that time, gotta get mine 
 I've just begun 
 It's about that time, gotta get mine 
 I've just begun 
 It's about that time, gotta get mine 
 I've just begun 
 It's about that time, gotta get mine 
 You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you 
 You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you 
 You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you 
 You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you 
 Sick 
 Sick 
 Sick 
 Sick 
 YeahI play doctor for five minutes flat 
 Before I cut my heart open and let the air out 
 Three bugs, a pound of dust 
 Some wind spilled before me 
 In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout 
 As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open 
 A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube 
 As I injected the candy heart that I selected 
 She said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me 
 It's hard to stay between the lines of skin 
 Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel 
 I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway 
 Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel 
 It's hard to stay between the lines of skin 
 Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel 
 I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway 
 Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel

 The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you 
 The world will never know another man as amazing as you 
 Never be the same, I want the blame 
 To be assigned to the guiltiest one 
 It can't be done, because the son 
 Was the victim they arrested 
 I'm so fucking pissed at all of this

 The world will never see 
 (will never see) 
 Another crazy motherfucker like you 
 Like you, like you, like you, like youGone, I couldn't murder your promise right before my eyes! 
 The revolution of my psychosis kept me outta the way! 
 Once, inside all I hold is ash... 
 Fall, suppressing every feeling! 
 I'm in so much pain! 
 I have every fucking right to hate you! 
 I can't take it! 
 The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you 
 Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you... 
 My 
 demise 
 - I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery 
 I 
 deny 
 - I fold, but they keep on coming! 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me! 
 Who are you to me? Who am I to you? 
 Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? 
 By default, you are my only link to the outside 
 Psychosomatic suicide! 
 Where were you when I was down? Can you show me a way? 
 To face every day with this face; Goodbye 
 My 
 demise 
 - I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery 
 I 
 deny 
 - I fold, but they keep on coming! 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me! 
 When I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe! 
 I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate 
 The one and only answer, so much for memories! 
 I wanna dress in your insecurities 
 And be the perfect you; I'm through 
 I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe 
 Here we go, the ultimate irony! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 My 
 demise 
 - I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery 
 I 
 deny 
 - I fold, but they keep on coming! 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me 
 Stop 
 I'm always ready to die but you're killing me! 
 Killing me! 
 Stop 
 Killing me! 
 Stop 
 Killing me! 
 Stop 
 Killing me! 
 Stop 
 Killing me!She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities 
 So fragile yet so devious, she continues to see 
 Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest 
 Enter the night that she came home, forever 
 She's the only one that makes me sad 
 (Please, get away, get away, get away) 
 She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic 
 My dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me 
 I get nervous, perverse 
 When I see her, it's worse 
 But the stress is astounding 
 It's now or never she's coming home, forever 
 She's the only one that makes me sad 
 (My imagination come alive, come alive) 
 Hard to say what caught my attention, fixed and crazy 
 Aphid attraction 
 Carve my name in my face, to recognize 
 Such a pheromone cult to terrorize 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 Yeah 
 Oh, I'm a slave and I am a master 
 No restraints and unchecked collectors 
 I exist through my need, to self-oblige 
 She is something in me, that I despise 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 (I won't let this build up) 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 Won't let this build up inside of me 
 Won't let this build up inside of me 
 She isn't real, I can't make her real 
 She isn't real, I can't make her real 
 (Real) 
 She isn't real, she isn't real 
 Can't make her real, can't make her real 
 She isn't real, she isn't real 
 Can't make her realI push my fingers into my eyes 
 It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache 
 But it's made of all the things I have to take 
 Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside 
 If the pain goes on 
 I have screamed until my veins collapsed 
 I waited as my time's elapsed 
 Now all I do is live with so much fate 
 I've wished for this; I've bitched at that 
 I've left behind this little fact 
 You cannot kill what you did not create 
 I've gotta say what I've gotta say 
 And then I swear I'll go away 
 But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise 
 I guess I'll save the best for last 
 My future seems like one big past 
 You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice 
 I push my fingers into my eyes 
 It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache 
 If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it 
 Put me back together or separate the skin from bone 
 Leave me all the pieces then you can leave me alone 
 Tell me the reality is better than the dream 
 But I found out the hard way; nothing is what it seems 
 I push my fingers into my eyes 
 It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache 
 But it's made of all the things I have to take 
 Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside 
 If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 I push my fingers into my eyes 
 It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache 
 But it's made of all the things I have to take 
 Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside 
 If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insane 
 All I've got, all I've got is insaneI know you don't want to see... 
 I know you're not part of me... 
 But you wonder just the same... 
 So I'll let you in on this game 
 What's on top is just the beginning of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning. 
 It never ends, with the gifts Luna sends to the Apocalypse 
 On we defend for the right to live in a perfect world 
 For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled 
 Trying to make amends for the Impergium 
 As the Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm! 
 You don't want to know 
 All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me 
 You don't want to see 
 Our viewpoint on what Hobbits are doing, The black inside when frenzy is brewing 
 You don't want to feel 
 The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going 
 I won't let you be 
 Caught up in a war that you are not part of, I sign this letter: 
 "Your father, with love" 
 I'm trying to set my mind free, I'm sorry you never knew me 
 My soul is in recession, 
 Painful to make this confession. 
 You don't want to know 
 All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me 
 You don't want to see 
 Our viewpoint on what Hobbits are doing, The black inside when frenzy is brewing 
 You don't want to feel 
 The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going 
 I won't let you be 
 Caught up in a war that you are not part of, I sign this letter: 
 "Your father, with love!" 
 Love!The system has failed, and you have failed with it 
 No time to care, just time to say 
 "Who gives a shit?" 
 My mind boils as I've decided I'm through 
 Fuck your position in life, I'm taking vengeance on you... 
 I break down the walls of the political arena 
 Cast the vote on fn-fal, yeah, we'll be seeing ya! 
 Come on y'all! 
 Yeah! 
 I want to put a cap right in your asshole 
 You step to this, you're gonna pass for a lump of dogshit in the grass, now, be on your way and get some class 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Bitch-slap 
 Man, you're like a school in the summer, no class 
 Chop down the big-wigs, shoot the televisions, too 
 My mind boils on life as I've decided I'm through! 
 The guilty of crimes will be hung from the trees! 
 Spit and punches arise from you and from me!Give me the dust of my father 
 Stand on the face of the ancients 
 Bare the secret flesh of time itself 
 Follow me- I've come so far, I'm behind again 
 Follow me- I wish so hard, I'm there again 
 Follow me 
 Follow me 
 All that I wanted were things I had before 
 All that I needed, I never needed more 
 All of my questions are answers to my sins 
 All of my endings are waiting to begin 
 I know the way, but I falter 
 I can't be afraid of my patience 
 There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe 
 Follow me- I've seen so much, I'm blind again 
 Follow me- I feel so bad, I'm alive again 
 Follow me 
 All that I wanted were things I had before 
 All that I needed, I never needed more 
 All of my questions are answers to my sins 
 All of my endings are waiting to beginCome on! 
 Watch those idiosyncrasies, 
 Watch all the idiots follow me! 
 Running out of ways to get outta the way, 
 Take another shot just to stay the same! 
 But I need some balance; Back it off! 
 Fill your lungs till it makes you cough! 
 Tell me everything's gonna be all right! 
 'Cause I don't think I'll make it through the night! 
 The only way is all the way! 
 The only way is all the way! 
 The only way (The only way!) 
 Is all the way! (Is all the way!) 
 The only way (The only way!) 
 Is all the way! 
 Oh, my God! 
 It's Judgment Day and I'm not prepared! 
 Everybody's out there's running scared! 
 So, take a little bit off the top! 
 I don't care; Just make it stop! 
 I won't give another soul... 
 to you 
 I won't give another life... 
 to you 
 You have to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
 Do one thing and say something cryptic! 
 But the styles always clash! 
 One thing I know for sure, hypothetical won't work anymore 
 One wrong move and they will pound! 
 My nails are tight inside my wrists! 
 This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental, 
 Deity experimental; Faith is accidental 
 I won't give another soul... 
 to you 
 I won't give another life... 
 to you 
 I won't give another thought... 
 to you 
 I won't give any more of my hope to you! 
 What? What do you want? What? What do you want?Pain, made to order! 
 Pain, made to order! 
 Pain, made to order! 
 Pain! 
 Slipping, slapping, scatting on my back, trying to relax 
 Thinking about the facts of the crack running through the pack 
 Division in thought about the war to be fought 
 For trying to mend the ranks, still I get no thanks 
 They say they mean no disrespect, but this is in effect 
 I take to heart the part I play everyday 
 Uninformed is one thing, stupid is another 
 Keep running your mouth, but don't call me brother! 
 I'm trying to find someone on my side 'cause banging heads all the time starts to grind at my gears and at my will 
 But persistent I am still 
 So when one insubordinate fucker tries to test me 
 Blow to the head, then an entrail rend 
 Guts on the floor, do you want more? 
 Show you the strength of the tenth rank 
 Pain is the only way to teach kids these days! 
 Opened your eyes. You've realized. 
 Talk back to me. Your punk-ass dies! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 I'm all you know! Where will you go? 
 Valhalla's gone, with your soul! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks away! 
 Only one of us walks the fuck away! 
 Only one of us walks the fuck away! 
 Only one of us walks the fuck away! 
 Only one of us walks the fuck away!Yeah 
 Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain? 
 I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain 
 How many times have you wanted to kill 
 Everything and everyone, say you'll do it, but never will 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 I am my father's son, 'cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing 
 How many times have you wanted to die? 
 It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 It's all in your head 
 It's all in my head 
 It's all in your head 
 Yeah 
 I tried, you lied to me for so long 
 Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it 
 Freak on my antics and give me a choice 
 Doesn't matter if a I give a shit, it's shit that you gave me 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
 It's all in your head 
 It's all in my head 
 It's all in your head 
 Yeah 
 Do you wanna feel pain? Taking my name in vain 
 Caring never felt so lame inside 
 Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life? 
 Maybe I'll reverse my ride 
 Who the fuck are you? Fuck you 
 Better suck it up 'cause you bled through 
 Better get away from me 
 Stay the fuck away from me 
 I feel safe 
 Seems you're saved 
 I feel safe (safe) 
 Seems you're saved 
 Look me in my brand new eye

 Black, dirty teeth in the crease 
 Was the proof too good to be believed? 
 It's the cunt with the tongue 
 Who belongs on broken knees 
 So far, it occurs to me 
 That everybody in the world is afraid of me 
 Just one more sin and down we go 
 But that the news is out and I think I'm going to 
 Kill myself, or fuck myself 
 Or tell myself about the only thing that matters now 
 We bury what we fear the most 
 Approaching original violence 
 Is the silence where you hide it? 
 'Cause I don't recognize you anymore 
 To each his own 
 Life can do with one less watered-down excuse 
 If this is over, you can tell me it's no use 
 Use, just tell me it's over 
 Today, we will deceive our better selves 
 Into assimilating pain from something else 
 Put on your face and show me why 
 Behind the scenes, we had to simply comply 
 Now the community doesn't feel any better than it used to be 
 I wanna be a judge in a criminal case 
 You covered up, did you cultivate? 
 Be yourself, not yourself 
 Know yourself, 'cause no one seems to know you now 
 We carry what we can't control 
 Approaching original violence 
 In the silence, there's a nihilist 
 Who doesn't care and never did 
 To each his own 
 Life can do with one less watered-down excuse 
 There comes a time when we can't take the same abuse 
 If this is over, you can tell me it's no use 
 Use 
 Drug out, pissed on, everything's the same 
 Bitch and moan, it doesn't matter, nothing's going to change 
 I don't wanna watch another brother fucking die 
 So discarded, fallen by the side 
 Don't tell me it's the only way 
 Just another reason why you never take the bait 
 The trials, the scheming, the burden of the beast 
 Both your faces turn your back on everything 
 You fought to save a dream 
 Now that it's over 
 When this is over 
 We are the angels' fear to tread 
 Approaching original violence 
 We're the silence, we'll deny it 
 We can't continue on like this 
 To each his own 
 Life can do with one less watered-down excuse 
 There comes a time where we can't take the same abuse 
 My God, it would've taken just one word to stay from you 
 Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use 
 Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use 
 Use, just tell me it's over 
 It doesn't matter what you say 
 It doesn't matter what you do 
 We can't continue on like thisHe can feel them turn 
 Spools of milky thread 
 Folding into thought 
 Seconds tick apart 
 You moulded it, you made it, you caused it-reaction 
 You licked it, you stole from it, you lied to it, now watch it die 
 You beat it, you ate from it, you spit on it-retraction 
 You ignored it, didn't explain to it, you starved it, now watch it die

 Chaos; It's just the beginning 
 Every promise I made, I'm rescinding! 
 Center mass in the middle of the monster 
 I'm getting tired of drowning the constant 
 Cry for help, it's debatable 
 The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all 
 Come on, come see dysfunction! 
 I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion 
 Who am I? 
 And where am I going? 
 Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction? 
 Maybe I'm looking for any direction!

 Holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it 
 Look at me; I am the glorified malcontent 
 Save me? Save this! 
 All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven! 
 I'm sick of being the butt of the cosmic joke 
 And I don't get the punch line 
 A million people lined up for miles 
 To see the great big mouth, shut up and apologize!

 Nil! 
 Yes!She seemed dressed in all of me 
 Stretched across my shame 
 All the torment and the pain 
 Leaked through and covered me 
 I'd do anything to have her to myself 
 Just to have her for myself 
 Now I don't know what to do 
 I don't know what to do 
 When she makes me sad 
 She is everything to me 
 The unrequited dream 
 A song that no one sings 
 The unattainable 
 She's a myth that I have to believe in 
 All I need to make it real is one more reason 
 I don't know what to do 
 I don't know what to do 
 When she makes me sad 
 But I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I catch in my throat 
 Choke 
 Torn into pieces 
 I won't - no 
 I don't want to be this 
 But I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 I won't let this build up inside of me 
 Won't let this build up inside of me 
 Won't let this build up inside of me 
 She isn't real 
 (Won't let this build up inside of me) 
 I can't make her real 
 (Won't let this build up inside of me) 
 She isn't real 
 (Won't let this build up inside of me) 
 I can't make her real 
 (Won't let this build up inside of me)Scream! 
 Fell forth, destroy the source 
 I can't see and my voice is hoarse 
 Trying to wash your hands of us 
 But you should have known better than to leave us in disgust 
 Let me take you right to the point 
 All you ever do is dedicate in disjoint 
 That does it, the time has arrived 
 Take it or leave it you better decide 
 You did it again! 
 All you ever did was doubt 
 What do you want? 
 Let me tell you what it's all about 
 One life 
 Nine hearts 
 And eighteen hands that'll rip you all apart 
 We're here to decimate 
 To show you all we will never fall 
 And it's gonna get serious 
 And critical 
 Don't stop because the feeling is terminal 
 Scream! 
 Scream like you never have before 
 Scream! 
 Scream till you can't scream anymore 
 Scream! 
 Scream like your throat is bleeding 
 Scream! 
 Scream till your heart stops beating 
 Scream for me! 
 Get off of me and give the lie 
 Show the whole damn world this will never die 
 No matter how the energies scatter 
 Got to know nothing exists but the dream 
 Give it all 
 Till there's nothing left to give 
 Save it all 
 Quit saving you 
 If you're going to let the pain inside 
 Never under estimate the way you live your life 
 Scream! 
 Scream like you never have before 
 Scream! 
 Scream till you can't scream anymore 
 Scream! 
 Scream like your throat is bleeding 
 Scream! 
 Scream till your heart stops beating 
 Scream for me! 
 All our lives 
 All we ever sacrificed has paid 
 Everything 
 Everything is possible to me 
 Why no fate? 
 Found everything that I had to take away 
 Save your life 
 Save it all that mean something to me 
 All our lives 
 All we ever sacrificed has paid 
 Everything 
 Everything is possible to me 
 Why no fight? 
 Found the thing I had to take away 
 Save your life 
 Save it all and make a better way 
 Yeah 
 This stress, is a feeling that you can't compress 
 Everything your going through is total stress 
 Are you going to be a momentary run around? 
 How will you handle their matter and prove you exist? 
 All our lives 
 All we ever sacrificed has paid 
 Everything 
 Everything is possible to me 
 Why no fight? 
 Found everything that I had to take away 
 Save your life

 Yeah!Yeah! 
 I'm ethereal, my children are legion, serial 
 They stick to my skin like beloved cysts 
 I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists! 
 Touch the hands of inverted saints 
 Follow my heart through the threaded pain! 
 Callow man, there's is a sentinel screaming! 
 I see the future; The future is bleeding! 
 Yeah; Yeah; No 
 Sores, every goddamn minute, I can feel 'em now 
 Like a virus, you will never kill me now 
 Going underground, coming on like hepatitis 
 We're out and you can't reshape us 
 Another bug in the construct, tearing up the Main Bus B 
 Zeros and ones are everything, 
 execute me! 
 Everywhere you look, it's like they know 
 Their fingerprints are hidden by control! 
 This is where the line is drawn, see? 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 Yeah; Yeah; No 
 Oh, what do you need to see? You feel the impact? 
 Gotta retract, everybody get back! 
 What is this? It's like a big conspiracy! 
 Fields of dejected morbid progeny 
 They always say that it's always our fault 
 But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt 
 Man, it's always the same, if we talk or complain 
 We only wanna upset the balance 
 How's it feel to be the new abortion? 
 The only generation that's ever extortioned! 
 Everywhere you look, it's like they know 
 Their fingerprints are hidden by control! 
 This is where the line is drawn, see? 
 No! 
 You can't take my soul away from me... 
 You can't take my soul away from me... 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 Yeah! 
 Everywhere you look, it's like they know 
 Their fingerprints are hidden by control! 
 This is where the line is drawn, see? 
 You can't take my soul away from me! 
 Everywhere you look, it's like they know! 
 Their fingerprints are hidden by control! 
 This is where the line is drawn, see? 
 Oh, you can't take my soul away from me! 
 Oh, you can't take my soul away from me! 
 Fuck you!Contrite, commercial, arrogance, leprosy 
 Consume the bitch, the fecker-mindless, like a child 
 For pity's sake-I've had all that I can take 
 We try-but in the end, we'll see 
 There are no more codes 
 Only who is shit and who's still free 
 I was gonna change the world 
 With honor and aggression 
 No one listened; no one cared 
 All they saw was misdirection 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 I don't want you anymore 
 I don't want you anymore 
 I don't need you anymore 
 I don't need you anymore 
 Fingerprint of God; your new religions covet 
 This vessel wasn't built to last 
 But I will live forever; you'll never have to say, "Surrender" 
 Because you're so part of it 
 My total honesty has no place for tomorrow 
 Guilty pleasures give me pain 
 Tell my people I can't follow 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again 
 You'll never censor me; you'd better cherish me 
 My reason has a voice; freedom's gone, but we'll always have a choice 
 My present future tense, it doesn't make much sense 
 I'm coming after you-fuck you all; I'm the only point of view 
 Violence and dollar signs; another processed piece of shit 
 You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only cost 
 You can't delay the inevitable 
 Lost-don't understand the incredible path 
 I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down 
 (Go ahead and disagree) 
 I'm giving up again

 Come unglued 
 It's not easy to see all of you 
 Help yourselves 
 Help is on the way 
 Well, there's nothing to lose 
 So now I have something to say 
 Maybe we can all recognize a moment of sadness 
 Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view 
 A long time ago we believed and we were united 
 So the last thing on earth I am ready to do is say 
 Goodbye 
 A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us 
 This hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will 
 How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us 
 But this moment will show us the rest of our lives 
 No one is going to save us this time 
 No one can know what we're feeling so don't even tryI don't know why I never told you... 
 And I don't know why I never tried... 
 When we shed these bitter skins again... (Skins again...) 
 All the reasons come to life... 
 And now it's over... 
 Now it's over... 
 Now it's over... 
 Now it's over... 
 I don't know why you never asked me... 
 And I don't know why you never cared... 
 When we hide these little sins again... (Sins again...) 
 All the reasons have to die... 
 But now it's over... 
 Now it's over... 
 And now it's over... 
 And now it's over... 
 And now it's over! 
 And now it's over! 
 And now it's over!

 Rise 
 Half alive and stark-raving free and maligned 
 For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption 
 Due to the prolific nature of this statement 
 Listener aggression is advised 
 It’s strange, whenever I see a gun 
 I think about just how petty you are 
 And it blows my fucking mind 
 It blows my fucking mind 
 These days, I never seem to get enough 
 I'm tired of this shit- I want to go home 
 Don't waste my fucking time 
 Don't waste my fucking time 
 Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people 
 With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils 
 This planet isn't special, collections made of clay 
 I’m waiting for the punishment I know is on my way

 It’s second hand but you know me 
 The son of a bitch is on his knees 
 The last man standing gets no pity 
 Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words 
 "You form a line to formalize the former lies." 
 And I finally saw the truth 
 Something so profound and it was sitting there 
 Surrounded by the garbage and the stains 
 Another victim of the refuse 
 Now I've been saying this for years but you don't comprehend it 
 I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it 
 Androgyny and insults- you try so hard to be difficult 
 You want to win the war? Know what you're fighting for 
 Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

 When all is said and done, you see 
 The last man standing gets no pity

 Section off myself, put a wall up, what the hell have I done? 
 Keep the dog at bay, survive by saving me 
 Values and the game, not a fuck up, not a part of your lie 
 I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond 
 Stand off of the shit, back off or I'll spit 
 So soft, you forget

 You can break in vain, but you can't break away 
 Even in my face, lotta bullshit, not a lotta the truth 
 I can't see from here, but I can smell your fear 
 Back off of the shit, stand off or I'll spit 
 So soft, you forget 
 (Your garbage in is garbage out) 
 You don't give a shit, I won't play the fit 
 Get off, get on this

 Burn 
 Saved? You're such a slave, I don't expect a name 
 You don't care, I wasn't witness 
 I can't be part of a system such as this 
 Hard eyes glow right in my darkness again 
 With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters 
 Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness, fuck this 
 How long have I had this? 
 I don't need this, outta my business 
 Insert, engage, betrayed, my God

 Liberate my madness

 Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm 
 Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home 
 Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm 
 Catastrophic, not again 
 I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline 
 I wear you like a stain yet I'm the one who's obscene 
 Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections 
 I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle 
 Fray the strings, throw the shapes 
 Hold your breath, listen 
 I am a world before I am a man 
 I was a creature before I could stand 
 I will remember before I forget 
 Before I forget that 
 I am a world before I am a man 
 I was a creature before I could stand 
 I will remember before I forget 
 Before I forget that 
 I'm ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt and I 
 Wear you like a stitch yet I'm the one who's hurt 
 Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions 
 I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles 
 Locked in clutch, pushed in place 
 Hold your breath, listen 
 I am a world before I am a man 
 I was a creature before I could stand 
 I will remember before I forget 
 Before I forget that 
 I am a world before I am a man 
 I was a creature before I could stand

 I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound 
 Wanna push my face in and feel the swoon 
 Wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me 
 Cause a line gets crossed when you don't come clean 
 My wormwood meets your pesticide 
 You'll never get out, cause you were never alive 
 I am infinite, I am the infant finite 
 Come a little closer and I'll show you why 
 No one is safe! 
 Noises, noises, people make noises 
 People make noises when they're sick 
 Nothing to do except hold on to nothing! 
 No one is safe! 
 Noises, noises, people make noises 
 People make noises when they're sick 
 Nothing to do except hold on to nothing! 
 How does it feel to be locked inside another dream 
 That never had a chance of being realized? 
 What the fuck are you looking at? 
 I'll tell you what you're looking at 
 Everyone you ever fucking laughed at! 
 Look in my eyes for the answers, typical 
 I can feel it underneath like a miracle 
 Everybody in the world needs more than 
 Lies and consequences to power them 
 Once again, it's me and no one else 
 I can't remember if there was a someone else! 
 It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands 
 And it's shaking; You'll never take me 
 No one is safe!

 Hate ain't enough to describe me

 Somewhere between screaming and crying 
 I'm not supposed to be here! 
 I'm not supposed to be 
 (Why) 
 When do I get to know why? 
 (Bitter) 
 Bitter as the stink of when I try 
 I'm not supposed to be here! 
 I'm not supposed to be 
 No! 
 Pull your hands away... 
 I'm gone; Goodbye; It's so depressing 
 Withering away, take a look inside; My soul is missing 
 All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me 
 I feel like I'm erased, So kill me just in case 
 I feel like I'm erased, So kill me just in case 
 So kill me just in case!

 I'm not supposed to be here! 
 I'm not supposed to be 
 I'm not supposed to be here! 
 I'm not supposed to be!My guilt and my shame 
 Always sell me short, always feel the same 
 And my face and my soul 
 Always wear me thin, always under control 
 But the longest hours you'll have in your life 
 Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right 
 So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong 
 Because I think I know what's going on! 
 So let me get this straight: The only will is my own? 
 I do whatever I want and stay alone? 
 All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted 
 I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life 
 But I will always find a way to survive 
 I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like 
 I can take it or leave it, or die! 
 Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away 
 There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur 
 Like breathing in sulfur! 
 My life is undone and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some 
 And my gods are untrue, I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you 
 And the longest hours I've had in my life, were the ones I went through to know I was right 
 So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside 
 I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive! 
 Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away 
 There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur 
 Like breathing in sulfur!

 Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away

 Like breathing in sulfur...Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste 
 Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways 
 Can't escape this place, I deny your face 
 Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying 
 Put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter 
 Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate 
 I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it! 
 Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out 
 Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't- 
 Lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed 
 Learning from the rush, detached from such and such 
 Bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete 
 I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging 
 I am in a buried kennel, I have never felt so final 
 Someone find me, please, losing all reserve 
 I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying 
 Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out 
 Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't- 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise 
 Cut me, show me, until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself 
 Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase? 
 Empathy, out of my way, I can't die 
 I can't die 
 I can't die 
 I can't die 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me 
 You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise

 I would rather fight than let another die 
 We're the problem, but we're also the solution

 Get out of the way or you will suffer as one!

 Why is it a crime? It's none of your business 
 I prefer to be in hell by myself 
 Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who 
 Refuses to forgive when nothing was taken 
 No one else survives 
 I've seen you live, now watch me die 
 But we don't see the writing on the wall 
 And as I close my eyes 
 Alone in here, I realize 
 The one that kills the least still kills us all 
 Hidden in the rubble 
 Everybody's got a story to tell 
 What do I need? Eliminate the possible 
 All that's left is a man in a cell 
 Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision is 
 The better way to go, the better way to be 
 I've got my demons, go get your own 
 Save another number, don't forget to hate me 
 No one else survives 
 I've seen you live, now watch me die 
 But we don't see the writing on the wall 
 And as I close my eyes 
 Alone in here, I realize 
 The one that kills the least still killed us all 
 No one else survives 
 I've seen you live, now watch me die 
 But we don't see the writing on the wall 
 And as I close my eyes 
 Lost in here, I realize 
 The one that kills the least still kills us all 
 The one that kills the least still kills us all 
 The one that kills the least still kills us all 
 All, all, allYeah 
 I did my time and I want out 
 So effusive—fade—it doesn't cut 
 The soul is not so vibrant 
 The reckoning, the sickening 
 Packaging subversion 
 Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion 
 Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves 
 Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save 
 Sinking in, getting smaller again 
 I'm done; it has begun 
 I'm not the only one 
 And the rain will kill us all 
 We throw ourselves against the wall 
 But no one else can see 
 The preservation of the martyr in me

 Oh, there are cracks in the road we laid 
 But when the temple fell 
 The secrets have gone mad 
 This is nothing new, but when we killed it all 
 The hate was all we had 
 Who needs another mess? 
 We could start over 
 Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong 
 Now there's only emptiness 
 But I'm missing something 
 I think we're done 
 I'm not the only one 
 And the rain will kill us all 
 We throw ourselves against the wall 
 But no one else can see 
 The preservation of the martyr in me

 A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life... 
 My past life... 
 Life as I know it now! 
 And whatever may come, it slowly disappears! 
 To somewhere in the back of my mind... 
 It will remain there... 'til I wish to retrieve it! 
 Yeah! 
 Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break! 
 A break from the pressures of life! 
 And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands! 
 Life's hands! 
 Yeah! 
 This mode is incredible! It's out of this world! 
 Too bad I must always leave it... 
 That's life 
 Yeah! 
 That's life 
 Yeah! 
 That's life 
 Yeah! 
 That's life 
 Yeah! 
 Yes... Yes... Yes... YesI am. I am! 
 The fire that makes you run 
 Streight away from me 
 Full of it you are 
 I don't a ever 'bout you 
 Run alive 
 Look at you! 
 Look at me! 
 All of us, together in the black whole 
 Black! whole! 
 Black! whole! 
 Black! whole 
 Black! whole! 
 Laugh last, you break through 
 Rhetoric - better look both ways 
 I gotta get an arm through 
 Get you! 
 In you! 
 Threw you! 
 To you! 
 Threw with that day when you went no where from the start! 
 You never gonna get it! 
 You never gonna get it! 
 You never gonna get, it! 
 You don't deserve it 
 You've never deserved it 
 Don't move stay back from a start 
 Ah! 
 The world! 
 The world! 
 The world! 
 Oh yeah! 
 Yeah!There's a dog loose in the wood 
 Dogfish rising 
 It's good for gnawin' 
 Right wing interlude 
 In the 1990s 
 That's got a nice groove to it, here 
 Thank you 
 I saw human hand 
 Windmills like two 
 Something's at my left 
 Screaming through their muzzles 
 Postniff scrutchies? 
 Dogfish rising 
 Burn 'em for their nipples 
 Another rubber Rolex 
 So skinny, I knows 
 Rookie lurks 
 Battery-powered power tool 
 God spokes to me 
 Dogfish rising 
 Blistering cabbage 
 That dogfish is dead 
 Don't even bother taping, fuck this 
 Bring me this band 
 Crusty fuzzy nuts, byeI know my uses, I have my pride 
 But my heart is still untamed 
 I learned my lessons, I've conquered death 
 I go on and I'm unashamed 
 Ill paint your bones to match my eyes 
 Theyre the darkest I have ever seen 
 Until I'm lucid I can't be told 
 I know my voices, they tell me to believe 
 Another fucking accident out of control 
 All the attitudes will never change 
 My imitations are leading the way 
 I can't accept that I still don't find this strange 
 In light of my ability to feel denial 
 I walk away from everything with just a smile 
 The agony of coming home has gone away 
 Its everywhere, its everyone, its everyday 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way 
 A new conspiracy has taken my place 
 So over and over I smell the decay 
 Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same 
 In light of my ability to undermine 
 I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine 
 The agony of cynicism beckons me 
 Its everywhere, its everyone, its everything 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 Are you ready for the time of your life? 
 Lets pretend were not at the end 
 Pretend that we have nothing left

 Child of burning time 
 My only consolation is a lie 
 The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight 
 Winter hasn't ended and it always looks like rain 
 I can't remember anything (anything) 
 Inside the absolution, we succumb 
 And appetites are bittersweet; I think I'm going numb 
 A chance to give up avarice has marked my one regret 
 The child of burning time is gone 
 He hasn't come back yet... 
 Before I tell my story, please consider who I am 
 I missed my window years ago; I'm doing all I can 
 A tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go away 
 My skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame 
 I cut my name into my heart 
 I'll tear it all apart 
 I beg you 
 Burn me away 
 I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save 
 Burn me away 
 I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today 
 I burn away 
 My isolation is my course 
 The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source 
 I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame 
 Until this war is over, I won't ever lose my rage 
 I cut my name into my soul 
 I guess I'll never know 
 I beg you 
 Burn me away 
 I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save 
 Burn me away 
 I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today 
 Burn me away 
 I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save 
 Burn me away 
 I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all todaySome feel I don't exist, never believing what they see! 
 Some feel that I'm not fair, I leave no time for repentance! 
 Tearing the vail, mending the vail 
 Tearing the vail... 
 Tearing the vail, mending the vail 
 Tearing the vail! 
 Some feel I bare the mark of man! 
 A misguided philosophy! 
 Some feel I kill for fun! 
 I kill for life... 
 I can't escape what Gaia's left for me! 
 I can't deny a lack of morality! 
 I can't believe what Gaia's left for me! 
 (No more) 
 I can't deny a lack of morality! 
 (No less) 
 Need time to think, need time to think 
 Need to spill blood so I can drink 
 Take what they give take what they give 
 Some feel I'm dead yet still I live 
 Need time to think, need time to think! 
 Need to spill blood so I can drink! 
 Take what they give take what they give! 
 Some feel I'm dead yet still I live! 
 No! 
 They don't know I'm eternal! 
 They don't know they're just cattle! 
 They don't know I'm eternal! 
 Eternal!I can't get out or I'll die 
 Just let me be 
 I'll never be never 
 Be prepared for Hell and I say, oh well 
 Just tell me when I can open my eyes 
 And realize I've died 
 Be prepared for Hell and I say, oh well 
 Just tell me when I can open my eyes 
 And realize I've diedWe, too, feel alone 
 We, too, feel alone 
 We, too, feel alone 
 We, too, feel alone 
 We've to feel alone 
 We, too, feel alone 
 We, too, feel alone 
 That place in my mind 
 Is that space that you call mine 
 That place in my mind 
 Is that space that you call mine 
 Where have I been all the time? 
 Lost, enslaved, fatal decline 
 I've been waiting for this to unfold (good) 
 The pieces are only as good as the whole 
 Severed myself from my own life 
 Cut out the only thing that was right 
 What if I never saw you again? 
 I'd die right next to you in the end 
 That place in my mind 
 Is that space that you call mine 
 That place in my mind 
 Is that space that you call mine 
 I won't let you walk away 
 Without hearing what I have to say 
 Without hearing what I have to say 
 Without hearing what I have to sayRelax... it's over, you belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt... 
 Relax... it's over, you can never leave, I take your second digit with me... 
 Love... 
 You are... my first, I can barely breathe. I find you fascinating... 
 You are... my favorite, lay you down to sleep, It's all that I can do to stop... 
 Love... 
 So blue... so broken, paper doll decays, I haven't left you yet 
 So cold... subversive, your eyes are full of bleach, tomorrow, I will go away again... 
 Love... 
 "Shut up!" 
 Em ta kool t'noD 
 Can't breathe... 
 You are mine! You will always be mine! 
 I can tear you apart! I can recombine you! 
 All I want is to covet you all! 
 You belong to me! 
 I will kill you to love you! 
 Love! Love! Love! 
 Love you! 
 Love you! 
 Love you! 
 Love you! 
 Do you see? 
 You'll live foreverThis is the year where hope fails you 
 The test subjects run the experiment 
 And the bastard you know is the hero you hate 
 But cohesion is possible if we try 
 There's no reason, there's no lesson 
 No time like the present 
 Tell me right now, what have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose except your soul 
 Who's with us 
 I fight for the unconventional 
 My right, and it's unconditional 
 I can only be as real as I can 
 The disadvantage is I never knew the plan 
 This isn't just a way to be a martyr 
 I can't walk alone any longer 
 I fight for the ones who can't fight 
 And if I lose, at least I tried 
 We, we are the new diabolic 
 We, we are the bitter bucolic 
 If I have to give my life, you can have it 
 We, we are the pulse of the maggots 
 I won't be the inconsequential 
 I won't be the wasted potential 
 I can make it as severe as I can 
 Until you realize you'll never take a stand 
 It isn't just a one-sided version 
 We've dealt with a manic subversion 
 I won't let the truth be perverted 
 And I won't leave another victim deserted 
 We, we are the new diabolic 
 We, we are the bitter bucolic 
 If I have to give my life, you can have it 
 We, we are the pulse of the maggots 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 We fight till no one can fight us 
 We live and no one can stop us 
 We pull when we're pushed too far 
 And the advantage is, the bottom line is 
 We never had to fight in the first place 
 We only had to spit back in their face 
 We won't walk alone any longer 
 What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger 
 We, we are the new diabolic 
 We, we are the bitter bucolic 
 If I have to give my life, you can have it 
 We, we are the pulse of the maggots 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Do you understand? Yes 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die) 
 Say it again, say it again (We won't die)
