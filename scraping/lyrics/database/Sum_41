Look at me 
 Who am I supposed to be 
 And what do I believe 
 Can you tell me 
 Since you've made up your mind 
 Who knows what you believe 
 And I just don't know 
 No I just don't know 
 Who I'm supposed to be... 
 Look at me 
 Am I the image of your hopes and tragedies 
 Just look at me 
 Will I ever be more than just a memory 
 Cause you just don't know 
 No you just don't know 
 All I am is me 
 All I am is me 
 All I am is meI don't want this moment 
 To ever end 
 Where everything's nothing 
 Without you 
 I wait here forever just to 
 To see you smile 
 'Cause it's true 
 I am nothing without you 
 Through it all 
 I made my mistakes 
 I'll stumble and fall 
 But I mean these words 
 I want you to know 
 With everything I won't let this go 
 These words are my heart and soul 
 I'll hold onto this moment you know 
 'Cause I bleed my heart out to show 
 That I won't let go 
 Thoughts read unspoken 
 Forever and now 
 And pieces of memories 
 Fall to the ground 
 I know what I didn't have so 
 I won't let this go 
 'Cause it's true 
 I am nothing without you 
 All the streets 
 Where I walked alone 
 With nowhere to go 
 Have come to an end 
 I want you to know 
 With everything I won't let this go 
 These words are my heart and soul 
 I'll hold onto this moment you know 
 'Cause I bleed my heart out to show 
 That I won't let go 
 In front of your eyes 
 It falls from the skies 
 When you don't know what you're looking to find 
 In front of your eyes 
 It falls from the skies 
 When you just never know what you will find 
 What you will find 
 What you will find 
 What you will find 
 What you will find 
 I don't want this moment 
 To ever end 
 Where everything's nothing 
 Without you 
 I want you to know 
 With everything I won't let this go 
 These words are my heart and soul 
 I'll hold onto this moment you know 
 'Cause I bleed my heart out to show 
 That I won't let go 
 I want you to know 
 With everything I won't let this go 
 These words are my heart and soul 
 I'll hold onto this moment you know 
 'Cause I bleed my heart out to show 
 That I won't let go.I've heard it before 
 I'm straight out of line 
 The image of malice 
 With one evil mind 
 I've got no excuse 
 It's my alibi 
 A victim of fashion 
 Dressed to do or die 
 Don't worry about me 
 I'm not your misery 
 A reject, no respect 
 (I don't, I don't, I don't...) 
 I don't want to be a conclusion 
 Victim of confusion 
 And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
 So here's my resignation 
 From the desperation 
 I'm the saint of hopeless 
 I make no apologies 
 Well this is a call 
 Throughout and across 
 The underdog nation 
 The hopeless and lost 
 'Cause we're not the ones 
 To walk with the dead 
 Disciples of no one 
 By no one we're led 
 Don't worry about me 
 I'm not your tragedy 
 A reject, no respect 
 (I don't, I don't, I don't...) 
 I don't want to be a conclusion 
 Victim of confusion 
 And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
 So here's my resignation 
 From the desperation 
 I'm the saint of hopeless 
 I make no apologies 
 (I make no apologies) 
 (x2) 
 I don't want to be a conclusion 
 Victim of confusion 
 And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
 So here's my resignation 
 From the desperation 
 I'm the saint of hopeless 
 I make no apologies 
 (x3)Take my breath away, 
 I don't need it anyway. 
 'Cause I'm fine here in my own forgotten world. 
 Where I can be myself, 
 Left with the hand I'm dealt, 
 And it's hard to get a grip when you're holding onto something you just let slip away. 
 All these thoughts stuck in my mind, 
 Spinning 'round like endless time. 
 For what's in my life. 
 I do wanna feel 
 Something you call real. 
 And I don't think that I've got 
 Time for these scars to heal. 
 And the days just go by 
 Leaving questions in my mind. 
 I guess I'll find the answers 
 Some day in another life. 
 Here with my old friend 
 The silence, in the end. 
 And it rings all out that I cannot pretend. 
 If I just close my eyes, 
 And ask a thousand whys, 
 Will it change or stay the same? 
 Will it ever go away? 
 The question still remains. 
 All these thoughts stuck in my mind, 
 Spinning 'round like endless time. 
 For what's in my life. 
 I do wanna feel 
 Something you call real. 
 And I don't think that I've got 
 Time for these scars to heal. 
 And the days just go by 
 Leaving questions in my mind. 
 I guess I'll find the answers 
 Some day in another life. 
 Warning signs 
 Read "desolation 
 On the road of 
 Desperation". 
 Happiness machines 
 Are coming clean, 
 What can you do for me? 
 I do wanna feel 
 Something you call real. 
 And I don't think that I've got 
 Time for these scars to heal. 
 And the days just go by 
 Leaving questions in my mind. 
 I guess I'll find the answers 
 Some day in another life. 
 So here, 
 Now I stand, at the end 
 Of a dark road out of hell. 
 It's not so hard, as I depart. 
 What a way to become a man.In my years, I've seen all sounds of misconception. 
 In my years, I've done all I can live to question. 
 What happened to me I don't understand. 
 I've seen all I can see as my time expands. 
 Bored I am, bored of my own desperation, 
 I can't defend, can't find my own destination. 
 What happened to me I don't understand. 
 I've seen all I can see as my time expands. 
 What's up with you, what's up with me.(x2) 
 I'm not the one I can't pretend, 
 What would I be if I did it all again. 
 And I sometimes wish I would have asked some 
 Questions. 
 Then maybe I would have a clearer life perception. 
 What's up with you, what's up with me. 
 What's up with you, what's up with me. 
 A time around.I addressed this letter to "dear father" 
 I know you as complete unknown 
 I guess it's better you don't bother 
 All our truth should be left alone 
 Be left alone 
 Be left alone 
 I learned the things you never showed me 
 Took the chances you'd have blown 
 And to this day, the one and only, 
 You remain a complete unknown 
 Complete unknown 
 Complete unknown 
 You're out there somewhere, 
 I don't know if you care, at all, 
 It seems that you don't 
 And since if that day will never come, 
 So you remain a complete unknown (unknown, unknown, unknown ..) 
 So many years have been ignored, 
 You've been gone without a trace 
 I'm getting used to knowing you're 
 Just a name without a face 
 Without a face 
 Without a face. 
 You're out there somewhere, 
 I don't know if you care, at all, 
 It seems that you don't 
 And since if that day will never come, 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
 You're out there somewhere, 
 I don't know if you care, at all,

 Getting better everyday 
 And I got you now I'm not alone 
 All I need in this life is one 
 One thing to believe in 
 I've seen many a face 
 From young and to old 
 I've stolen their faith and I have broken their souls 
 Was here before Christ have forgave you your sins 
 And paid your price and sealed your fate within. 
 Days have come to an end 
 Today's the day that we meet again 
 The self inflicted inebriation 
 Guilt never lies alone 
 I've been waiting for the chance 
 To reunite this sick romance 
 Poison never hurt so good! 
 So nice of you speak of me 
 Your closest friend and enemy! 
 An only savior 
 Of masochists! 
 Well it's the dead end slave 
 From the alter to the grave 
 It's the last days of our lives 
 In faith amen. 
 Time, it's been so long 
 And now there's nothing to say 
 I'm trying so hard to find the words to say 
 I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not 
 I can't believe and I never thought 
 Days would come to an end 
 But maybe some day 
 We'll meet again 
 If ever that day never comes 
 It would be to soon (move along) 
 I've been waiting for the chance 
 To nullify this sick romance 
 Pull the cord to detonate 
 So sick of you 
 Don't speak of me 
 Don't represent the misery 
 An only savior 
 Of masochists! 
 Well it's the dead end slave 
 From the alter to the grave 
 It's the last days of our lives 
 Well it's the dead end slave 
 From the alter to the grave 
 It's the last days of our lives 
 In faith amen.

 One thing to believe inStorming through the party like my name is El Ni√±o 
 When I'm a hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino 
 As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name 
 Crashed my own house party 'cause nobody came 
 I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school 
 Never going, never showing up when we had to 
 Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave 
 I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" 
 I don't want to waste my time 
 Become another casualty of society 
 I'll never fall in line 
 Become another victim of your conformity and back down 
 Because you don't 
 Know us at all we laugh when old people fall 
 But what would you expect with a conscience so small 
 Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised 
 Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised 
 'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expenses 
 Cutting people down is just a minor offense and 
 Its none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn 
 I'm sick of being told to wait my turn 
 I don't want to waste my time 
 Become another casualty of society 
 I'll never fall in line 
 Become another victim of your conformity and back down 
 Don't count on me to let you know when 
 Don't count on me, I'll do it again 
 Don't count on me, it's the point you're missin' 
 Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listenin' 
 Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat 
 Back-packed and I don't give a shit about nothing 
 You be standing on the corner talking all that kumuppin 
 But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing 
 Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook 
 You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book 
 I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion 
 The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion 
 (Abortion, abortion, abortion) 
 I don't want to waste my time 
 Become another casualty of society 
 I'll never fall in line 
 Become another victim of your conformity and back down 
 (Waste my time with them) 
 Causality of society 
 (Waste my time again) 
 Victim of your conformity and back downIt's far beyond your reach 
 It holds a place in time 
 Somewhere ahead is the back of the line 
 I can't relate 
 To your mistakes 
 Awkwardly speaking with nothing to say 
 Caught up in your life 
 Excuses are so lame 
 You may be different but I'm still the same 
 The reasons that you thought 
 The attention that you caught 
 You say things are simple 
 We both know they're not 
 You can't let it go 
 Whoa 
 You can't but I know 
 Whoa 
 Whoa 
 You don't even know 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 It's not in what you do 
 What you do 
 A million questions asked 
 The remnants of the past 
 You've always been denied 
 But I was by your side 
 I've always tried to 
 To understand you 
 The world's not learning from you 
 Whoa 
 Whoa 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 (Whoa) 
 It's not in what you do 
 More in what you say 
 (Whoa) 
 It's not in what you do 
 What you dooooI don't expect you to believe 
 'Cause through those eyes of yours 
 You see just what you want to see 
 Pieces of all your shattered dreams 
 If you keep your head so low 
 You'll never see what you could be 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 Do you want to really fight 
 About differences tonight 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 But I, I don't expect you to believe 
 'Cause when you think your race is run 
 And you're left standing there 
 With all your laces still undone 
 It's like the end has just begun (begun) 
 And you feel so alone 
 But know you're not the only one 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 Do you want to really fight 
 About differences tonight 
 Take a look around 
 We're the same in all different ways 
 But I, I don't expect you to believe 
 I don't expect you to believe

 But I, I don't expect you to believeI've been waiting for something for so long 
 To show me the answers that I want 
 A reason to believe in that's so strong 
 But I don't think that it exists 
 I've been waiting for something for so long 
 To show me the answers that I want 
 A reason to believe in that's so strong 
 But I don't think that it exists 
 Yeah, give me reason to believe 
 This world's not a sick machine 
 When everywhere's a dead end 
 In every direction 
 Yeah, can you give me what I need 
 Or just sit bad and watch me bleed 
 'Cause after all you can't get 
 Everything you want now 
 But all I would need is one 
 Thing to keep me moving on 
 Everybody's got a secret 
 Can you tell me, what is mine? 
 Can you tell me what you'd find? 
 I'll tell you if you keep it, I promise not to lie 
 Well I have the fears 
 The pain and the tears 
 I just can't hide 
 It all disappears 
 'Cause everything passes 
 With the time 
 All you need 
 Is reason to believeIt's something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time 
 It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine 
 You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing all right 
 I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight 
 You know that you had to know that I'd be on my way 
 It happened long ago there's nothing more to say 
 And I don't wanna be the one to tell you blood is on your hands 
 And I don't think you realize or even understand so I say 
 Days go by some good and some are bad 
 Soon you'll realize it all goes by so fast and it's over 
 It's something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time 
 It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine 
 You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing all right 
 I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight 
 It's something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time 
 It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine 
 You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing all right 
 I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonightRunning fast and missing but cannot help convincing. 
 The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin. 
 It's not meant to hurt you but let me assure you, 
 It's not what I said but intentions you've read. 
 So when you hold onto the past then you 
 Will break down what little is left, yeah 
 There's nothing more you can't ignore, 
 And say it makes no difference to me. 
 It makes no difference to me 
 Now that you're older life's weighing on your shoulders. 
 You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight. 
 With most things so basic you might as well face it. 
 You can't help but worry it's all just begun 
 So when you hold onto the past then you, 
 Will break down what little is left, yeah 
 There's nothing more you can't ignore, 
 And say it makes no difference to me. 
 It makes no difference, to me 
 It makes no difference, to me, 
 It makes no difference, to me 
 It makes no difference 
 So when you hold onto the past then you, 
 Will break down what little is left. yeah 
 There's nothing more you can't ignore, 
 And say it makes no difference to me. 
 It makes no difference 
 It makes no difference, to me 
 It makes no difference 
 It makes no difference, to meMad in a way, but I don't say 
 It's what you're used to. 
 I got the words but can't convey. 
 I know you'll turn it all around, 
 It's the rhythms that you go through 
 Get it back and you're not obliged to say, 
 Not intact but you're better off anyway. 
 Somehow it's never up to me. 
 What if I would say? 
 Simple words I can't relate. 
 I don't place upon your view, 
 It's the rhythms that you go through. 
 I know what I want, 
 You just take me through the motions. 
 I know what I want, 
 And that's more than you can say. 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out. 
 Your story still remains 
 It's so unlike you, still you stay the same, 
 But all the while you're counting on your day to come, 
 But nothing ever told you. 
 You would say that it's only for a day. 
 Yesterday's last week tomorrow's on its way. 
 I'm falling faster all the time. 
 What if I would say? 
 Simple words that I can't relate. 
 What came easy is now too late. 
 And it was always standing right in front of me. 
 'Cause I know what I want, 
 You just take me through the motions. 
 I know what I want, 
 And that's more than you can say. 
 All the time you thought worth saving, 
 Still end up with memories fading. 
 After all that you wouldn't do, 
 It makes no sense, 
 It's the rhythm that you go through. 
 I know what I want, 
 You just take me through the motions. 
 I know what I want, 
 And that's more than you can say. I know what I want, 
 You just take me through the motions. 
 I know what I want, 
 And that's more than you can say. 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out, 
 Since you found me out.Lately I'm not quite myself 
 Maybe I do need some help 
 Just my confusion 
 [I] trust my delusions 
 Don't you regret you met me 
 [I'll] go through these steps to get me 
 Back to where we start 
 Before I fall apart 
 If I could black out, it'd become so clear 
 Standing face to face with everything I fear 
 [I] watch so closely, but still I don't see 
 As bad as it seems, a piece of mind I'd steal 
 In ordinary life the consequence is real 
 I'm past the point of reality 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 But it's just everything we do 
 Till you open up your eyes 
 And understand this isn't real 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 This is everything but true 
 Till we come to realize 
 It's what we put each other through 
 It's like a bad dream that's becoming all too true 
 (??? without a trace and) 
 Leaving me with nothing else left to do 
 (I'm lost inside this place now) 
 Now so helpless, I'm not so selfish 
 Tell me: how does it feel to have a face like that? 
 How does it feel to be replaced like that? 
 Now so faceless, do you still feel? 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 But it's just everything we do 
 Till you open up your eyes 
 And understand this isn't real 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 (Open your eyes) 
 This is everything but true 
 Till we come to realize 
 (Come to realize) 
 It's what we put each other through 
 It's hard to believe right now 
 This seems to be real 
 It's unfazing by this time 
 So why can't I wake up? 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 (Open your eyes) 
 But it's just everything we do 
 Till you open up your eyes 
 (Come to realize) 
 And understand this isn't real 
 This isn't me, this isn't you 
 (Open your eyes) 
 This is everything but true 
 Till we come to realize 
 (Come to realize) 
 It's what we put each other throughTu es mon (ma) madamoiselle 
 Tu es mon (ma) petite poubelle 
 Je chercherai des ordures pour toi 
 Je commencerai dedans mes pantalons

 Mais je ne suis pas un autre coeur 
 Tu sais tu es ma petite fleur 
 Avec une plotte qui est comme du beurre

 Try to scream, there's no sound at all. 
 I'm stuck with nowhere to turn, 
 But I'm trying. 
 Trying not to be the one 
 Left behind to become undone. 
 You can't stop what's already begun! 
 Hear the down and out! 
 I'm not giving up, 
 I won't let go, 
 'Cause I am here till I'm gone. 
 This time, I've had enough, 
 I'm on my own. 
 But I am back where I belong. 
 You stand closer, but you're far away. 
 Seems like it's farther everyday. 
 The feelings never go away, 
 But I'm trying. 
 At the end of a losing race. 
 Time passes me without a trace. 
 Trying hard just to find a place. 
 Now that I'm onto you. 
 I'm not giving up, 
 I won't let go, 
 'Cause I am here till I'm gone. 
 This time, I've had enough, 
 I'm on my own. 
 But I am back where I belong. 
 Memories, they hold a place, 
 Just in time to go to waste; 
 And they all become replaced. 
 I'm not giving up, 
 I won't let go, 
 'Cause I am back where I belong. 
 I'm not giving up, 
 I won't let go, 
 'Cause I am here till I'm gone. 
 This time, I've had enough, 
 I'm on my own. 
 But I am back where I belong.It's so hard to say that I'm sorry 
 I'll make everything all right 
 All these things that I've done 
 Now what have I become 
 And where'd I go wrong 
 I don't mean to hurt 
 Just to put you first 
 I won't tell you lies 
 I will stand accused 
 With my hand on my heart 
 I'm just trying to say... 
 I'm sorry 
 It's all that I can say 
 You mean so much 
 And I'd fix all that I've done 
 If I could start again 
 I'd throw it all away 
 To the shadows of regrets 
 And you would have the best of me 
 I know that I can't take back all of the mistakes 
 But I will try 
 Although it's not easy, I know you believe me 
 'Cause I would not lie 
 Don't believe their lies 
 Told through jealous eyes 
 They don't understand 
 I won't break your heart 
 I won't bring you down 
 But I will have to say 
 I'm sorry 
 It's all that I can say 
 You mean so much 
 And I'd fix all that I've done 
 If I could start again 
 I'd throw it all away 
 To the shadows of regrets 
 And you would have the best of me 
 I'm sorry 
 It's all that I can say 
 You mean so much

 To the shadows of regrets 
 And you would have the best of meSilence is ringing in my head 
 Stuck on repeat 
 Not much longer I'll be dead 
 So just forget me 
 I'm losing my mind 
 And I don't think you could save me this time 
 And it goes 
 On and on 
 And I just feel helpless 
 How long will this take to wear off? 
 On and on 
 When will I get through this? 
 Welcome to my own down and out 
 I'm falling deeper in this hole, to disaster 
 I'm gripping what I thought control, was falling faster 
 I'm losing my mind 
 And I don't think you could save me this time 
 And it goes 
 On and On 
 And I just feel helpless 
 How long will this take to wear off? 
 On and on 
 When will I get through this? 
 Welcome to my own down and out 
 It's dragging on 
 I'm wearing thin 
 I can't stop these walls 
 They keep caving in 
 It's gone too far 
 Where's my mind? 
 Why can't time stop fear this paranoia? 
 It's a never ending story! 
 And it starts with me! 
 It's a never ending story! 
 And it starts with me! 
 And it goes 
 On and on 
 And I just feel helpless 
 How long will this take to wear off? 
 On and on

 Welcome, welcome 
 Welcome to my own down and out 
 Welcome, welcome 
 To my own down and out 
 (I'm falling further) 
 Welcome to my own down and outYou don't have the answers but you're always blaming 
 Me. 
 It only lies in your behalf in animosity. 
 You decide it's up to you, make it what you'll be. 
 After all you seem to be it makes no sense to me. 
 Don't point your finger at me 
 It's all your odyssey 
 It's such a foolish game so quick to point the blame 
 And now tables have turned 
 Shut upWhere do I begin, 'cause my story's still untold 
 Left to be unwritten, like memories to unfold 
 And I don't believe the truth, it doesn't make me feel alive 
 The truth's just overrated, we've all got something to hide 
 Cause lies make it so much fun 
 So sing the praise of insincerity 
 Make this your last prayer 
 As the dream becomes your worst nightmare 
 I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape 
 I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head 
 Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game 
 Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head 
 Pay me no more mind, have I really come undone? 
 I left the world this evening, just to kill the sun 
 And I've got no more to bleed, all that's left will soon be gone 
 And especially before 
 My mind fades like the stars at dawn 
 Well I bet you got a lot to say 
 So have it your way and crucify me 
 Make this your last prayer 
 As the dream becomes your worst nightmare 
 I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape 
 I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head 
 Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game 
 Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head 
 Breathless kiss to end all this 
 I fall, I say goodbye to all 
 Close my eyes, a sweet demise 
 A love that no one understands 
 And I don't believe in redemption 
 And no one will be spared 
 There's 32 ways you can die here tonight 
 It's a fucking family affair 
 I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape 
 I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head 
 Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game 
 Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his headToday is too late - How long do we have to wait? 
 Oh, no - I think she knows - That's why I can't let go 
 I feel this burning inside - A feeling that no one should know 
 [If] this could be so good again 
 I'd wait here till then 
 I'm done with this, so now I'll leave with 
 No apologies - I never thought you'd be 
 So easily deceived - Now I'll just hang my head 
 (I'm falling further out of place) 
 While I walk with the dead 
 (With all the lies I can't erase) 
 I'll just hang my head 
 We're met with regret - Memories that we'll both forget 
 So far, it's been so hard to cover up these scars 
 I see this falling apart - It's easy to just let it go 
 No luck between us both, so why keep waiting 
 I'm done with this, so now I'll leave with 
 No apologies - I never thought you'd be 
 So easily deceived - Now I'll just hang my head 
 (I'm falling further out of place) 
 While I walk with the dead 
 (With all the lies I can't erase) 
 I'll just hang my head 
 What's left to show? It's so bad, but I've got to know 
 What's right? Don't know how to find it out on my own 
 A-one by one, we both fall down (Don't believe it) 
 But who's the first one to hit the ground now? 
 Well, what's worse: taking the fall or (Don't believe it) 
 Be stuck standing alone? 
 Well, I'll keep your promises if you (Don't believe it) 
 Take back every thing I said 
 I find it's got so cold now (Don't believe it) 
 That I've lost my heart and soul 
 No apologies - I never thought you'd be 
 So easily deceived - Now I'll just hang my head 
 I'm falling further out of place 
 While I walk with the dead 
 With all the lies I can't erase 
 I'll just hang my head 
 Hang my headI don't believe in the secrets you keep 
 But I do wanna know 
 How do you sleep at night 
 And I'm over you, congratulations 
 Thank you for all the pain 
 Cause it made it be so much more fun 
 There's nothing to say now 
 The feelings are already dead (they're dead) 
 And I don't believe there's a way now 
 All that is said has been said (been said) 
 I'm waiting for another day, another way 
 I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away 
 So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes 
 Seen through the lines, while believing the lies 
 For too long a time 
 And I still don't know how I did 
 And now war's declared, drawing the battle lines 
 And I can't see straight anymore 
 With all of this blood in my eyes 
 There's nothing to say now 
 The feelings are already dead (they're dead) 
 And I don't believe there's a way now 
 All that is said has been said (been said) 
 I'm waiting for another day, another way 
 I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away 
 So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes

 I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away 
 So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyesMy teachers always told me that I had to have a plan 
 But their visions off and they don't understand 
 The little Hitler's of the forgotten love 
 They'll shoot you right in your face and watch you spill your blood 
 And you tell me that I'm the one who needs to have a plan 
 Tie me to the road, and watch my hands bleed 
 Pin me to a cross, and crucify me 
 Drag me through the dirt, of guilt and envy 
 Open up your eyes, and you will see 
 You're not a saviour or a saint, 
 Well then, 
 Who are you to me? 
 (Take a look at yourself) 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see 
 (Take a look at yourself) 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see 
 Mother why do you believe it will always be ok? 
 Another wishful dream that you believe 
 And what we have here, is people selling fear 
 It's a joke by now, we've become not clear 
 And you tell me that I'm the one who needs to have a plan 
 Television plays, effected my mind 
 Channels all the same, or am I blind? 
 Imagination is, it's just a figment 
 Of reality, when will you see? 
 You're not a saviour or a saint, 
 Well then, 
 Who are you to me? 
 (Take a look at yourself) 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see 
 (Take a look at yourself) 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see 
 -Rock ooooout with your cock out- 
 Take a look at yourself 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see 
 (Take a look at yourself) 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just, 
 Look inside the mirror and 
 Tell me what you see

 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want help just 
 I can't help you, 
 You don't stand a chance to make it 
 If you really want helpWait - How long would you wait 
 Just for me to call? 
 I know you make mistakes 
 Yeah, but 
 I hope some day you have it all 
 Cause I feel like a prisoner 
 Trapped inside this broken world 
 While I'm playing the victim again 
 Running in circles 
 To me, it's all the same 
 And though nothing's gonna change, still 
 I hope someday you have it all 
 Take this aggravation that I've thrown myself into 
 Change this situation just cause I need something new 
 And still I feel like a prisoner 
 Trapped inside this broken world 
 While I'm playing the victim again 
 Running in circles 
 To me it's all the same 
 And though nothing's gonna change, still 
 I hope someday you have it all 
 I hope someday you have it all 
 If we could all depend 
 On what we know 
 If you could understand 
 I'm losing control 
 That I'm losing control (I'm losing control) 
 That I'm losing control (I'm losing control) 
 That I'm losing control (I'm losing control)Jump all you can and you got out your right foot 
 The sooner you get out in your hide away 
 I might be left dead side of the road 
 Serves a place and time 
 I plan on never waking up 
 I plan on never waking up 
 Jump all you can and you got out your right foot 
 The sooner you get out in your hide away 
 I might be left dead, get out the way 
 Serves a place and time 
 I plan on never waking up 
 I plan on never waking up 
 I plan on never waking up 
 I plan on never waking upI've said this before, 
 No matter how hard I try. 
 I can't help be bored, 
 While this world passes by. 
 So this revelation's got no meaning, 
 We lost it all in hopeless dreaming. 
 Am I just losing grip, 
 Paint it black and just forget me. 
 This worlds a sinking ship, 
 'Cause our baggage is too heavy. 
 I can't stop believing there's something to be said, 
 What are we achieving with the bullshit that we're fed. 
 I know I'm not going to stay, 
 Or live to see the day this world comes to be, 
 So here's a resignation from me (3x) 
 I've said this before, 
 No matter how hard I try. 
 I can't help be bored, 
 While this world passes by. 
 Don't tell me we're close to something, 
 That we don't even understand. 
 Were prisoners to our homes 
 Some might say that were all to blame. 
 The outside's so unknown, 
 And no one here to complain. 
 I can't find the answers to save humanity, 
 I can't fight the anger here's a resignation from me, 
 A resignation from me (x4)A jester of sorts 
 You stand holding your court 
 Over minions of capital hill 
 In a bath full of blood 
 Up alone, standing still 
 Under God, you can fire at will 
 And when (when!) 
 The devil's angels come 
 Take your life and lead you 
 To the flames beneath 
 You're headstone reads now, (hey!) 
 Here lies the dead who was, 
 Hung by his head beneath us, 
 Playing in their graves, 
 Damnation free for all 
 A prodigal son 
 Can't undo what he's done 
 A figurehead of capital crime 
 With a light shining down 
 As you fall to your knees 
 To repent would be nothing but lies 
 And when (when!) 
 The devil's angels come 
 Take your life and lead you 
 To the flames beneath 
 Your headstone reads now, (hey!) 
 Here lies the dead who was, 
 Hung by his head beneath us, 
 Playing in their graves, 
 Damnation free for all 
 La la la la la la la la la la la... (hey!) (hey!).. 
 Dead beat 
 Six feet 
 Dead underground (ooh oh) 
 An eye for an eye 
 Only leaves us all blind 
 Going once, twice, there goes your life 
 And when (when!) 
 The devil's angels come 
 Take your life and lead you 
 To the flames beneath 
 Your headstone reads now, (hey!) 
 Here lies the dead who was, 
 Hung by his head beneath us, 
 Playing in their graves, 
 Damnation free for allWe have the passion of the unbroken 
 And our souls we will not sell 
 You can beat us down but when we come around 
 We'll damn you all to hell 
 Waiting for a sign, I guess I missed it on the way 
 I tried to walk the line but it's more than I could take 
 I get so tired of waiting; your signal's fading out 
 You're on the outside before you even know you're out of place 
 I've had enough and your time is up 
 So give me something, that one thing real 
 And I'll say yeah, 'cause I've been going out of my head again 
 Just waiting for a lifeline 
 Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky 
 While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs till you die 
 Give it to me, give till you ain't got anymore 
 'Cause I need it to believe it, that you still got any soul 
 Give it to me give till you ain't got anymore 
 Pick your heart off the floor and scream it out 
 God save us all 
 I've given up the grudge and saying all I have to say 
 Show me how to judge and I'll find another way 
 I don't know how to fake it; I think I'm breaking down 
 Under the pressure, before you know it something's gotta give 
 I've had enough and your time is up 
 So give me something, that one thing real 
 And I'll say yeah, 'cause I've been going out of my head again 
 Just waiting for a lifeline 
 Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky 
 While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs till you die 
 Give it to me, give till you ain't got anymore 
 'Cause I need it to believe it, that you still got any soul 
 Give it to me give till you ain't got anymore 
 Pick your heart off the floor and scream it out 
 God save us all 
 God save us all 
 We have the passion of the unbroken 
 And our souls we will not sell 
 You can beat us down but when we come around 
 We'll damn you all to hell 
 Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky 
 While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs till you die 
 Give it to me, give till you ain't got anymore 
 'Cause I need it to believe it, that you still got any soul 
 Give it to me give till you ain't got anymore 
 Pick your heart off the floor and scream it out 
 God save us all 
 Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky 
 While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs till you die 
 God save us all 
 Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky 
 While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs till you die 
 God save us allI'm not quite myself these days 
 Guess we all come undone 
 Time to time in different ways, well 
 I have myself to blame 
 Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways 
 God's got a plan for me 
 Well I'm gonna tell you one thing 
 I don't got the patience, or the time 
 What can I say? 
 I'm no angel 
 I'm not forsaken, 
 But I can bleed 
 Tear me open, I believe 
 God will set you up to bleed 
 And no one can deceive 
 What it's meant to be and 
 "Bloody Murder" we will scream 
 Well I guess it's time for me 
 Tell me what I'm left to believe in? 
 'Cause I don't know the concept 
 Of the pain 
 I don't want the faith 
 I'll just lose it 
 I can prove it 
 Watch me bleed 
 Tear me open, I believe 
 God will set you up to bleed 
 And no one can deceive 
 What it's meant to be and 
 "Bloody Murder" we will scream 
 God will send you all to tear me open! 
 'Cause I'm 
 Not giving up 
 No self control 
 Suffocating to the bone 
 I'm my worst enemy 
 Who can't be saved 
 I'm just his disgrace 
 Tear me open, I believe 
 God will set you up to bleed 
 And no one can deceive 
 What it's meant to be and 
 "Bloody Murder" we will scream 
 God will send you all to tear me open! 
 These days are strange it's true. 
 There's not a thing that I would change, 
 No mistakes that I'd undo.Hands up! Hands up

 WHOO! The Red Light District! 
 Ah, we in The Red Light DistrictTime passes by, direction unknown 
 You've left us now, but we're not alone 
 Before you know it your cup's overflown 
 You measured no one that I've ever known 
 And it's quite alright 
 And goodbye for now 
 Just look up to the stars 
 And believe who you are 
 'Cause it's quite alright 
 And so long, goodbye 
 We always knew that it'd come to this 
 It's times like these I forget what I miss 
 Matters of heart are hard to address 
 Especially when yours is full of emptiness 
 And it's quite alright 
 And goodbye for now 
 Just look up to the stars 
 And believe who you are 
 'Cause it's quite alright 
 And so long, goodbye 
 Well, Time passes by, direction unknown 
 You've left us now, but we're not alone 
 Before you know it your cup's overflown 
 Well, You measured no one that I've ever known 
 And it's quite alright 
 And goodbye for now 
 Just look up to the stars 
 And believe who you are 
 'Cause it's quite alright 
 And so long, goodbyeWant it all... Are we singing? 
 Take everything left from me 
 All! To! Blame! 
 How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need 
 Telling lies, alibis - Selling all the hate that we breed 
 Super size our tragedies (You can't define me or justify greed) 
 Bought in the land of the free (Land, free) 
 And we're all to blame 
 We've gone too far - From pride to shame 
 We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain 
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are 
 We want it all 
 With no sacrifice! 
 Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear 
 Stand to salute and say thanks to the man of the year 
 How did we all come to this (You can't define me or justify greed) 
 A greed that we just can't resist (Resist) 
 And we're all to blame 
 We've gone too far - From pride to shame 
 We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain 
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are 
 We want it all 
 Everyone wants it all 
 With no...sacrifice! 
 Tell me now: what have we done? We don't know 
 I can't allow what has begun to tear me down 
 Believe me now - We have no choice left with our backs against the wall 
 And now, we're all to blame 
 We've gone too far - From pride to shame 
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind 
 When all we need is something true to believe 
 Don't we all 
 Everyone, everyone? 
 We will fall 
 Cause we're all to blame 
 We've gone too far - From pride to shame 
 We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain 
 We want it all, everyone 
 Don't we all......Well, maybe nothing else will ever be so clear 
 Or maybe that's only my fear 
 If just for one day, I wish I could disappear 
 Just take me far from here 
 Maybe I'd find out nothing new 
 Maybe I'd end up just like you 
 There's no solution (No solution) 
 Give me truth to my conviction 
 Is my own confusion (My own confusion) 
 Reality or fiction? 
 Am I out of my mind? 
 The constant pressure that keeps hanging over me 
 It makes me feel so empty 
 It's more than anything that I could ever be 
 What else could you take from me? 
 It's getting harder to relate 
 Don't want to make the same mistakes 
 There's no solution (No solution) 
 Give me truth to my conviction 
 Is my own confusion (My own confusion) 
 Reality or fiction? 
 Am I out of my mind? 
 It took me so long to find out it's right 
 There in front of me 
 Too close to see 
 What I thought was true 
 I see right through what's killing you 
 There's no solution (I can see) 
 Give me truth to my conviction 
 Is my own confusion (That I feel) 
 Reality or fiction? 
 Am I out of my mind? 
 So maybe nothing else will ever be so clear 
 Or maybe that's only my fear 
 (Am I out of my mind?) 
 If just for one day I wish I could disappear 
 Just take me far from here 
 (Am I out of my mind?) 
 (Far from here, far from here, far from here, far from here)All right boys, are you ready? 
 Here it comes... Let's go! 
 Reign in Pain - C'mon we're gonna Reign in Pain (x2) 
 Get ready we're coming for you we're gonna make our way to your town 
 Prepare for this evil affair by letting everyone around 
 Realize you'll be demonized we're gonna make sure you get stung 
 Don't stop we're about to rock bring your Converse shoes with maxi-pad tongues, yeah! 
 Your future's looking grim, let's bathe in sin

 It's not so nice, but we've got your vice 
 If you're looking for a debauchery we got a heavy metal jamboree 
 Reign in PAIN - C'mon we're gonna Reign in PAIN (x2)What happened to you? 
 You've played the victim for so long now in this game. 
 What I thought was true 
 Is made of fiction and I'm following the same. 
 But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in 
 I'm not sure where I should begin. 
 I'm falling, I'm falling... 
 Now I'm in 
 Over my head, with something I said 
 Completely misread I'm better off dead. 
 And now I can see, how fake you can be 
 This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me. 
 It's none of my concern. 
 Why look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame. 
 I guess you never heard. 
 I've met our makers they don't even know your name. 
 But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell 
 I'd say my time has served me well. 
 I'm falling, I'm falling... 
 Now I'm in 
 Over my head, with something I said 
 Completely misread I'm better off dead. 
 And now I can see, how fake you can be 
 This hypocrisy's beginning to get to... 
 This came long before, 
 Those who suffer more 
 I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare. 
 What's with my disgrace 
 I lost the human race 
 No one plans for it to blow up in their face! 
 Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces? 
 Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces? 
 Now I'm in 
 Over my head, with something I said 
 Completely misread I'm better off dead. 
 And now I can see, how fake you can be 
 This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me. 
 Over my head, better off dead. 
 Over my head, better off dead--all right!Ladies and gentlemen of the underclass: 
 The President of the United States of America... is Dead! 
 I don't believe in the politics 
 Of chosen fools and hypocrites 
 Who walk a line that's stretched so fine 
 Is it death or glory you had in mind? 
 Here we go, again it's mass delusion 
 No one knows who leads this revolution now 
 As tension grows, no way to a conclusion 
 It's too late, there's no time 
 (It's too late, there's no time) 
 All for none, none for 1,2,3,4 
 March of the dogs 
 To a beat of disillusion 
 Sworn under God bringing panic and confusion 
 The white flag is down 
 Send in the clowns 
 The carnival of sins is now about to begin 
 It may be I'm a pessimist 
 But I'd say we need an exorcist 
 The root of all evil standing tall 
 Under God and above us all 
 Here we go, again in desperation 
 All we know is confusion and frustration now 
 As tension grows, no vision of salvation 
 It's too late, there's no time 
 (It's too late, there's no time) 
 All for none, none for 1,2,3,4 
 March of the dogs 
 To a beat of disillusion 
 Sworn under God bringing panic and confusion 
 The white flag is down 
 Send in the clowns 
 The carnival of sins is now about to begin 
 1,2,3,4 
 And now the president's dead 
 Because They blew off his head 
 No more neck to be red 
 Guess to heaven he fled 
 Was it something he said 
 Because of who's in his bed 
 By whom will we be lead 
 From whose hand will we be fed 
 All the lies by the lying liars 
 Who said, we'll be fine, it's okay 
 Hey look mom, no head! 
 Blah blah blah blah 
 (It's a carnival of sins!) 
 Blah blah blah 
 (It's about to begin!) 
 Blah blah blah 
 Blah blah blah 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... 
 (It's OK, all right...)Lies and deceiving is what I'm believing 
 Up to my knees so hard to breathe 
 It helps that you aren't there 
 Can't figure out what's the right thing for me 
 Guess I'll have to wait and see 
 So understanding but so far from the truth 
 It's what I have to live with 
 It's not all I wanted to be 
 It's not all I wanted to see 
 I can't keep on leading 
 I've left what I'm leaving 
 Guess that's just what I believe 
 Consciously taking and overly faking 
 I can't believe all the things that you're saying 
 Seems all so simple it's all up to you 
 Time after time 
 You lost what you couldn't find 
 It's what you could (what you could) 
 It's only what you could (it's what you could) 
 Don't take what you could 
 But I know what's up 
 So understanding but so far from the truth 
 It's what I have to live with 
 It's not all I wanted to be 
 It's not all I wanted to see 
 I can't keep on leading 
 I've left what I'm leaving 
 Guess that's just what I believeWhat am I to say? 
 I'm all wrapped up in apathy 
 And I don't want to stay this way 
 There's nothing left to do 
 Now that I am onto you 
 All I want to know is the truth 
 And I don't want to go 
 But I feel like I should 
 'Cause I'm falling apart, and I might 
 And I, and I, and I 
 How could you be the better part of me? 
 When we're only half of what we used to be, today 
 Could you see this isn't what we need? 
 And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell 
 So goodbye, farewell 
 What am I to say? 
 I still remember everyday 
 Memories don't fade away 
 And it all falls apart 
 In the shadows of the past 
 It can seem to be so hard 
 But it's time the feelings past 
 How could you be the better part of me? 
 When we're only half of what we used to be, today 
 Could you see this isn't what we need? 
 And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell 
 So goodbye, farewell 
 And pull your triggers now 
 What you waiting for? 
 I stand accused myself 
 Sometimes I'm wrong 
 God help me 
 And here beneath my lie 
 What am I praying for? 
 I don't believe in Hell 
 But I just might be there tonight 
 How could you be the better part of me? 
 When we're only half of what we used to be, today 
 Could you see this isn't what we need? 
 And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell 
 So goodbye, farewell 
 Goodbye, farewell1, 2, 3, 4 
 Well... I... won't be caught living in a dead end job (job). 
 While praying to my government, guns, and God (God). 
 Now it's us against them, 
 We're here to represent. 
 And spit right in the face of the establishment. 
 And now I don't believe (In having faith in nothing!), 
 Stand on my own (Got no sympathy!). 
 Wasting the youth (While being young and useless!), 
 Speak for yourself (And don't pray for me!). 
 Well because we're doing fine, 
 And we don't need to be told. 
 That we're doing fine, 
 'Cause we won't give you control. 
 And we don't need anything from you. 
 'Cause we'll be just fine, 
 And we won't be bought and sold, 
 Just like you. 
 ( 
 A call across the Underclass 
 ) 
 Calling out loud with no respect ('spect) 
 I'm not the one, just another reject ('ject) 
 I'm the voice to offend 
 All those who pretend 
 Unsung against the grain I'm here to rise against 
 And now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere!), 
 Burning the flag (Of the degeneration!), 
 Everyone sing (The Anthem of no future!), 
 Down with the mass ('Cause we're not listening!). 
 Well because we're doing fine 
 And we don't need to be told. 
 That we're doing fine, 
 'Cause we won't give you control. 
 And we don't need anything from you, 
 'Cause we'll be just fine. 
 And we won't be bought and sold, 
 Just like you. 
 ( 
 May I have your attention please... 
 I pledge allegiance to the underclass as your hero at large. 
 ) 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 We're the saints of, degeneration. 
 We don't owe anyone an explanation. 
 Fuck elitists, 
 We don't need this, 
 We're the elite of just all right. 
 And well because, we're doing fine 
 And we don't need to be told 
 That we're doing fine 
 'Cause we won't give you control 
 And we don't need anything from you 
 'Cause we'll be just fine 
 And we won't be bought and sold 
 Just like youHere as I stand, all the signs become so clear 
 To get back home again sometimes I lose my way 
 Because I'm bound to fall, and just lose it all 
 Am I running out of time? 
 I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew 
 Beaten black and blue, it's time 
 To be face to face with the lies I choose 
 Throw the truth into the light 
 Make no mistake, I've paid my price 
 I've done my time with the devil in disguise 
 'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight 
 I'm breaking the chain 
 Days pass me by like I'm saving wasted time 
 I'm not all right, I think I've fallen for the lie 
 And as it fades to black, I'm not looking back 
 I'm so blinded by the lights 
 I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew 
 Beaten black and blue, it's time 
 To be face to face with the lies I choose 
 Throw the truth into the light 
 Make no mistake, I've paid my price 
 I've done my time with the devil in disguise 
 'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight 
 I'm breaking the chain 
 'Cause I'm done chasing, chasing yesterday 
 (I've lost the feeling) 
 Scars don't fade, they never go away 
 (And I'm still bleeding) 
 Every step that I take, all the chains that I break 
 It brings me one step closer 
 Breaking the chain 
 I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew 
 Beaten black and blue, it's time 
 To be face to face with the lies I choose 
 Throw the truth into the light 
 Make no mistake, I've paid my price 
 I've done my time with the devil in disguise 
 'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight 
 I'm breaking the chain 
 I'm breaking the chain 
 I'm breaking the chainThe faster we're falling 
 We're stopping and stalling 
 We're running in circles again 
 Just as things were looking up 
 You said it wasn't good enough 
 But still we're trying one more time 
 Maybe we're just trying too hard 
 When really it's closer than it is too far 
 'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 Instead of going under 
 Seems like each time 
 I'm with you, I lose my mind 
 Because I'm bending over backwards to relate 
 It's one thing to complain 
 But when you're driving me insane 
 Well, then I think it's time that we took a break 
 Maybe we're just trying too hard 
 When really it's closer than it is too far 
 'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 Instead of going under 
 Instead of going under 
 I can't sit back and wonder why 
 It took so long for this to die 
 And I hate it when you fake it 
 You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it 
 So believe me, it's not easy 
 It seems that something's telling me 
 I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep 
 Up above in my head instead of going under 
 Instead of going under 
 Instead of going under again 
 Instead of going under 
 Instead of going under again 
 Instead of going under againHow many people here are proud to be Canadian? 
 How many people here love Canadian beer? 
 How many people here think George W. Bush is a fucking moron? 
 Well this song is about just thatI was tuning in the shine on the light night dial 
 Doing anything my radio advised 
 With every one of those late night stations 
 Playing songs bringing tears to my eyes 
 I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver 
 When the switch broke 'cause it's old 
 They're saying things that I can hardly believe 
 They really think we're getting out of control 
 Radio is a sound salvation 
 Radio is cleaning up the nation 
 They say you better listen to the voice of reason 
 But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason 
 So you had better do as you are told 
 You better listen to the radio 
 I wanna bite the hand that feeds me 
 I wanna bite that hand so badly 
 I want to make them wish they'd never seen me 
 Some of my friends sit around every evening 
 And they worry about the times ahead 
 But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference 
 And the promise of an early bed 
 You either shut up or get cut up, they don't wanna hear about it 
 It's only inches on the reel-to-reel 
 And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools 
 Tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel 
 Radio is a sound salvation 
 Radio is cleaning up the nation 
 They say you better listen to the voice of reason 
 But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason 
 So you had better do as you are told 
 You better listen to the radio 
 Wonderful radio 
 Wonderful radio 
 Marvelous radio 
 Radio, radio 
 Radio, radio 
 Radio, radioUp in smoke, pop goes the culture 
 The tension blew it up 
 We're choking from a bleeding ulcer 
 We eventually threw up out so 
 What went wrong? Where's the voice of reason? 
 It's long gone, we lost it long ago 
 Apathy plus-sized filled the void of motivation 
 I can hardly breathe at all 
 Confusion's all I see 
 Frustration surrounds me 
 Solution, bid farewell 
 Sedation, what the hell? 
 I broke the mirror to the past 
 To find what I was looking for 
 A bleeding heart of broken glass 
 Is all I found and nothing more regrets 
 Short of no correction 
 Paid my debts, to anxiety 
 The iron lung collapsed from the pressure and the swelling 
 I can hardly breathe at all 
 Confusion's all I see 
 Frustration surrounds me 
 Solution, bid farewell 
 Sedation, what the hell? 
 Confusion's all I see 
 Frustration surrounds me 
 Solution, bid farewell 
 Sedation, what the hell? 
 Dead-end roads 
 And warning signs 
 Destination nowhere 
 In sight 
 So! 
 Divided we stand 
 Together we fall 
 There isn't a God 
 That can save us all 
 So don't pray on your knees 
 Just, beg on your hands 
 There is no belief 
 In this promised land 
 Divided we stand 
 Together we fall 
 There's no God 
 That can save us all 
 So don't pray on your knees 
 Just, beg on your hands 
 There is no belief 
 In this promised land 
 There is no belief 
 Confusion's all I see 
 Frustration surrounds me 
 Solution, bid farewell 
 Sedation, what the hell? 
 Confusion's all I see 
 Frustration surrounds me 
 Solution, bid farewell 
 Sedation, what the hell?Welcome to obsession 
 It makes the world go 'round 
 We're made up by the people we surround 
 (So) We live and die for s**t we don't need 
 Well, maybe that's the price of envy 
 Through these eyes, I look out for me 
 But everyone fades in ways we don't see 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 We're going down in flames 
 I'm not the one 
 Don't wait for me 
 Cause I won't just sit by 
 While you just bleed 
 Myself and others dry 
 Don't wait for me 
 To be there in the end 
 When you don't see 
 The truth you just pretend 
 Don't wait for me 
 What is the solution 
 We don't already know? 
 There's no telling how far this could go (No) 
 You do your time - Punch in - It's the same 
 Cause you're just part of this game 
 There's nothing you could do to save yourself 
 You leave your life in the hands of someone else 
 They'll never let it go 
 It's the only way you know 
 I'm not the one 
 Don't wait for me 
 Cause I won't just sit by 
 While you just bleed 
 Myself and others dry 
 Don't wait for me 
 To be there in the end 
 When you don't see 
 The truth you just pretend 
 Don't wait for me 
 When did we begin 
 To let ourselves give in 
 How'd it come to this 
 Miserable bliss 
 Just take the rest of 
 Just take the best of me 
 Just take the rest of 
 Just take the best of me 
 You take the rest of me 
 Just take the best of me 
 You take the rest of me 
 Just take the best 
 Don't wait for me 
 Cause I won't just sit by 
 While you just bleed 
 Myself and others dry 
 Don't wait for me 
 To be there in the end 
 When you don't see 
 The truth you just pretend 
 Don't wait for me(Fuckin' Shit) 
 You look like ass 
 You smell like shit 
 So why are you such a dick? 
 You walk around like you're the tits 
 You always make me sick 
 Bound for agony 
 You life's catastrophe 
 You look like ass 
 You smell like shit 
 So why are you such a dick? 
 You walk around like you're the tits 
 You always make me sick 
 Bound for agony 
 Your life's catastrophe 
 You're an asshole 
 You're an asshole 
 You're an asshole 
 You're an asshole 
 You make me sickI tried to be perfect, but nothin' was worth it 
 I don't believe it makes me real 
 I thought it'd be easy, but no one believes me 
 I meant all the things I said 
 If you believe it's in my soul 
 I'd say all the words that I know 
 Just to see if it would show 
 That I'm trying to let you know 
 That I'm better off on my own 
 This place is so empty 
 My thoughts are so tempting 
 I don't know how it got so bad 
 Sometimes it's so crazy that nothing can save me 
 But it's the only thing that I have 
 If you believe it's in my soul 
 I'd say all the words that I know 
 Just to see if it would show 
 That I'm trying to let you know 
 That I'm better off on my own 
 On my own 
 I tried to be perfect - It just wasn't worth it 
 Nothing could ever be so wrong 
 It's hard to believe me 
 It never gets easy 
 I guess I knew that all along 
 If you believe it's in my soul 
 I'd say all the words that I know 
 Just to see if it would show 
 That I'm trying to let you know 
 That I'm better off on my ownI'm heading for the end 
 On top of this bullshit 
 I don't want to hear it 
 I found my way again 
 It's hard to explain it 
 I know that I hate it 
 I don't feel this could be real 
 I find it so hard 
 I'm falling apart 
 So much so much 
 For what for what we said 
 No matter what I say 
 You turn your back away 
 It's never going to break you 
 It's never going to make you fall 
 Fake reality 
 I never can make up 
 The time that you take up 
 It's my worst enemy 
 I'm on a mission 
 To feed my addiction 
 So sick of thoughts so empty 
 It's well overflowed 
 I'm bound to explode 
 So much so much 
 For what for what we said 
 No matter what I say 
 You turn your back away 
 It's never going to break you 
 It's never going to make you fall 
 Somehow 
 Between the lines it's clearer 
 Locked down 
 And chained up to the mirror 
 Somehow 
 Between the lines it's clearer 
 Locked down 
 It takes a part of me 
 I'm heading for the end 
 On top of this bullshit 
 I don't want to hear it 
 I found my way again 
 It's hard to explain it 
 I know that I hate it 
 I don't feel this could be real 
 I find it so hard 
 I'm falling apart 
 So much so much 
 For what for what we said 
 Corus (x2): 
 No matter what I say 
 You turn your back away 
 It's never going to break you 
 It's never going to make you fallRemember when there was nothing else to do 
 But lie in bed and 
 Wonder how it was always up to you 
 And no one else and 
 Early mornings, made by warnings 
 What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring? 
 It's even raining, I'm not complaining 
 But waking up is hard to do so 
 Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay 
 Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day 
 Why get up, my morning doesn't even start 'til two? 
 Forget reality waking up is hard to do 
 Remember when we would hang out every day 
 And we would rather 
 Not be told what to do or what to say 
 'Cause nothing mattered 
 Never boring, slept in mornings 
 Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming 
 It's not important if days are shortened 
 I can't make time when nothing's new 
 'Cause waking up is hard to do so 
 Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay 
 Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day 
 Why get up, my morning doesn't even start 'til two? 
 Forget reality waking up is hard to do 
 What's a day when it all ends up the same 
 And lasts forever? 
 Can't complain when there's nothing there to blame 
 And things can't be better 
 Summer evenings, teenage grievings 
 Got no problem with the life that I've been leading 
 No concentration on hesitation. 
 I can't make time when nothing's new 
 'Cause waking up is hard to do so 
 Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay 
 Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day 
 Why get up, my morning doesn't even start 'til two? 
 Forget reality waking up is hard to doI'll never take part in the growing population 
 Or waste my time with further education 
 Forget what we know 
 It's just a big show 
 What they want to control 
 So jaded, frustrated 
 It's all so complicated 
 Fashion, no passion surrounds me 
 All I know is 
 I've heard this all before 
 Reality's a bore 
 You ask me to believe in something fake 
 Well I can't bring myself to 
 Do what you want me to 
 This is who we are and 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 I can't take part in the businessman illusion 
 I'll take my chance in the real world confusion 
 Don't blame us 
 Who do we trust 
 When they're so dishonest? 
 No patience, this nation's obsessed with exploitation 
 Lying, denying surrounds me 
 All I know is 
 I've heard this all before 
 Reality's a bore 
 You ask me to believe in something fake 
 Well I can't bring myself to 
 Do what you want me to 
 This is who we are and 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 Don't think you can ignore us 
 Don't tell me that we're to blame 
 Don't pick our future for us 
 Or act like we're the same 
 All I know is 
 I've heard this all before 
 Reality's a bore 
 You ask me to believe in something fake 
 Well I can't bring myself to 
 Do what you want me to 
 This is who we are and 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 (Thanks for nothing) 
 I've heard this all before 
 (Thanks for nothing) 
 Reality's a bore 
 (Thanks for nothing) 
 It'll never be the same 
 (Thanks for nothing) 
 And nothings gonna change...I haven't been home for a while, 
 I'm sure everything's the same, 
 Mom and Dad both in denial, 
 And only child to take the blame, 
 Sorry, Mom, but I don't miss you, 
 Father's no name you deserve, 
 I'm just a kid with no ambitions, 
 Wouldn't come home for the world, 
 You'll never know what I've become, 
 The king of all that's said and done, 
 The forgotten son, 
 This city's buried in defeat, 
 I walk along these no-name streets, 
 Wave goodbye to all, 
 As I fall... 
 At the dead-end I begin, 
 To burn our bridge of innocence, 
 Satisfaction guaranteed, 
 A pillow-weight catastrophe, 
 On a mission nowhere bound, 
 Inhibitions underground, 
 A shallow grave I, 
 Have dug all by myself, 
 And now I've been gone for so long, 
 I can't remember who was wrong, 
 All innocence is long gone, 
 I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief, 
 Where I belong, 
 A walking disaster, 
 The son of all bastards, 
 You regret you made me, 
 It's too late to save me, 
 (You regret you made me 
 It's too late to save me) 
 As far as I can tell, 
 It's just voices in my head, 
 Am I talking to myself, 
 'Cause I don't know what I just said, 
 (And she said) 
 As far as where I fell, 
 Maybe I'm better off dead, 
 Am I at the end of nowhere, 
 Is this as good as it gets? 
 And now I've been gone for so long, 
 I can't remember who was wrong, 
 All innocence is long gone, 
 I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief, 
 Where I belong, 
 A walking disaster, 
 The son of all bastards, 
 You regret you made me, 
 It's too late to save me, 
 To save me, (x13) 
 And now I've been gone for so long, 
 I can't remember who was wrong, 
 All innocence is long gone, 
 I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief, 
 Where I belong, 
 A walking disaster, 
 The son of all bastards, 
 You regret you made me, 
 It's too late to save me, 
 I will be home in a while, 
 You don't have to say a word, 
 I can't wait to see you smile, 
 Wouldn't miss it for the world, 
 I will be home in a while, 
 You don't have to say a word, 
 I can't wait to see you smile, 
 Wouldn't miss it for the world...I never wanted to be another one in the same 
 I may never fit in, but I will always remain 
 If only you could read my mind 
 If only just for one more time 
 You say there's nowhere to run, but I got nothing to hide 
 I could see through the shit, even through these black eyes 
 A confession of a dangerous mind 
 A direction to perfection is the last thing I want 
 So tell me when does enough ever become enough 
 If everything is to lose then I will never give up 
 I don't care what you got in mind 
 The truth is never hard to find 
 I've been trying to break the only link in the chain 
 I've been pleading the fifth 'cause I've got nothing to say 
 A bad plan with no warning signs 
 A god given secret with the passion I don't want 
 'Cause this I say to you 
 I'm bleeding out my heart 
 Tell me if it's true, this is tearing me apart 
 So tell me one more time 
 'Cause I can't let you go 
 If this is where it lies help me, 'cause I just need to know 
 The truth is all I needed to know 
 Do you still feel the same way too 
 Don't tell... 
 'Cause this I say to you 
 I'm bleeding out my heart 
 Tell me if it's true, this is tearing me apart 
 So tell me one more time 
 'Cause I can't let you go 
 If this is where it lies help me, 'cause I just need to know 
 'Cause this I say to you 
 I'm bleeding out my heart 
 Tell me if it's true, this is tearing me apart 
 So tell me one more time 
 'Cause I can't let you go 
 If this is where it lies help me, 'cause I just need to knowEver get the feeling no one's got your back 
 Caught up in themselves livin' lies besides the fact 
 Somehow you're going on an opposite track 
 As we recover from another social heart attack 
 You think you see between the lines 
 But you can't see through dollar signs 
 So sick and tasteless now 
 Immature and faceless how 
 Can I even sleep at night you ask 
 You say you're a pacifist 
 Instead you wave your fist 
 And all the while it becomes the end again 
 Make up your mind 'cause I can't decide 
 You think uniqueulism makes you dignified 
 You can't see with half opened eyes 
 You think you're standing up instead you're falling far behind 
 What I do is what I choose which makes it my decision 
 If your life was a book your story would be fiction 
 Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion 
 It's number 32 now here's the situation 
 If the beat moves your feet then don't change the station 
 Pack your bags 'cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation 
 Well, I'm a disaster 
 A microphone master 
 Put on the tape, I'll rock your ghetto blaster 
 It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts 
 About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts 
 I'm Hot Chocolate and you'll see me running late 
 'Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great 
 And I'm Bizzy D from way down town 
 I'm known to rock a mic like a king with a crown 
 When I'm on top I'm gonna borrow that bootie 
 Hustling deals like Micky Macoote 
 When I wake up I like a pound of bacon 
 Start off the day with my arteries shaking 
 ROCK! 
 It's what were all about it's what we live for 
 C'mon and shout it out [x4] 
 You see me in 3D, I'm comin' live and direct 
 With a dialect most men in science can't disect 
 Thoughts interwoven, and let us interlock 
 So now it's my thing to blow off steam and get my cream 
 Sum 41 get wild, I get frantic 
 And every time we spit it the world panicks 
 I maybe lost my mind well I ain't through the coop 
 But Sum 41 just ain't about a loop 
 Ring a ling a ling ding dong tick tock, shit, it's all about rap 
 And maybe all about rock!When I grow up 
 Don't wanna be a doctor 
 A lawyer or a cop 
 All I want to be 
 Is an Astronaut 
 Why can't you see? 
 It's the only thing I wanna be 
 Suit and tie is not for me 
 It's my destiny to be (to be) 
 An astronaut 
 Astronaut, wanna be an astronaut 
 An astronaut, wanna be an astronaut 
 Astronaut, wanna be an astronaut 
 An astronaut 
 Why can't you understand 
 I want to take command 
 Of a spaceship 
 Mom and dad, 
 You gave me everything you never had 
 But all I want to be 
 My life long dream 
 All I want to be is an 
 Astronaut 
 Wanna be an Astronaut 
 An Astronaut 
 Wanna be an Astronaut 
 An Astronaut 
 Wanna be an Astronaut 
 Astronaut 
 Wanna be Astronaut 
 An Astronaut 
 Wanna be Astronaut 
 Astronaut 
 Wanna be Astronaut 
 An AstronautTake me away 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 I'm getting sick of hypocrites saying nothing 
 Got a feeling that I don't belong 
 And you seem to feel like it's alright 
 Take your pick, dirty tricks, say you're bluffing 
 Takes a lifetime just to right the wrong 
 And I've never felt this, so alive 
 You're all dead to me 
 Gotta say it was nice to know you all 
 Take a look cause the writing's on the wall 
 You disappear but I survive 
 Don't believe that it's only black and white 
 It's written in all the diamonds of the night 
 And I've never felt this, so alive 
 You're all dead to me 
 You're all dead to me 
 You're all dead to meChildren of the beast embrace 
 To scorn and hate the human race 
 Consume the light that hugs the Earth 
 And aid the womb in giving birth 
 To a group that will appear 
 And guide you through this final year 
 The dark armies then will come 
 When the sum is 41It's your last chance to find yourself in consequence. 
 It's so hard to find a simple reason. 
 Maybe I'll find myself with evidence. 
 Hate breeds with nothing to believe in. 
 Another day, another day in paradise. 
 If you only knew wouldn't it be nice. 
 Get away get away get away. 
 I'm about to detonate. 
 Everything to prove, 
 Nothing to lose 
 Just when everything has fallen to the ground, 
 Gonna knock it down 
 Just believe me when I tell you it's alright. 
 This time we're on our way to tragedy 
 Forever bored and outside from the in crowd. 
 I've come to grip confronting my reality. 
 Numb-struck it's me against the world now. 
 For all you know, for all you know it's not for real. 
 Spare me the obsession that you deal. 
 Get away get away get away. 
 I'm about to detonate 
 Everything to prove, 
 Nothing to lose 
 Just when everything has fallen to the ground, 
 Gonna knock it down 
 Just believe me when I tell you it's alright. 
 Everything to prove, 
 Nothing to lose 
 Just when everything has fallen to the ground, 
 Gonna knock it down 
 Just believe me when I tell you it's alright. 
 I should've know right from the start 
 That you'd take this trust and rip me apart. 
 Could it be a change of heart? 
 I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. 
 I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. 
 I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. 
 I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real.All of us believe that this is not up to you 
 The fact of the matter is that it's up to me 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Let's go 
 How can we fake this anymore? (Anymore) 
 We turn our backs away and choose to just ignore (Choose to just ignore) 
 (Some say) Some say it's ignorance 
 It makes me feel some innocence 
 It takes away a part of me 
 But I won't let go 
 Tell me, why, can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way) 
 When we all fall down, it will be too late 
 Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason) 
 When we all fall down, who will take the blame? 
 What will it take? 
 If nothing could ever be this real (Be this real) 
 A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel) 
 (Some say) This future's not so bright 
 Some can't make the sacrifice 
 (Some say)  It's much more than just black and white 
 And I won't follow 
 Tell me, why, can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way) 
 When we all fall down, it will be too late 
 Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason) 
 When we all fall down, who will take the blame? 
 What will it take? 
 Times like these, I've come to see how 
 Everything but time is running out 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Alright 
 All of us believe in what we need 
 What we have's what we don't see 
 Tell me, why, can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way) 
 When we all fall down, it will be too late 
 Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason) 
 When we all fall down, who will take the blame? 
 What will it take? 
 So how long has this gone on? 
 I don't see this ending 
 It's too late - We can't change 
 What has now begun 
 We act like it's not right 
 Why are we pretending? 
 We've been wrong for so long 
 We've known this all alongWas happiness a fad 
 Or was it in the lost and found again behind the issues 
 It might not be so bad 
 We're all addicted to our tragedy 
 I guess it's what it had to be 
 With nothing on my back 
 It's still enough to bring me down 
 My mind's about to crack 
 'Cause what I thought could not be found 
 Matter of in fact 
 It's harder still when you're around 
 With nothing on my back I can't help but drown 
 I might as well belong to both of you 
 And the mess you always seem to drag me through 
 That night forever always haunting me 
 But I guess it is what it's supposed to be 
 But spare your thoughts of sympathy 
 With nothing on my back 
 It's still enough to bring me down 
 My mind's about to crack 
 'Cause what I thought could not be found 
 Matter of in fact 
 It's harder still when you're around 
 With nothing on my back I can't help but drownI don't believe, I think I'm falling asleep 
 Is this beginning or ending, am I stuck in a dream? 
 I don't want to know what I think, I suppose 
 Out of the light, and into this time of demise 
 And there's a cross on the hill, the holy image lies 
 I've opened my mind, but this dream is still real 
 You don't need to worry, I'm just fine 
 I've just lost my mind 
 Tell me it's over 
 'Cause I don't feel a thing at all 
 No conscience, there's no more 
 Senses all have disappeared 
 Am I all right, alive tonight? 
 Paranoid, am I too late? 
 Am I all right, alive tonight? 
 Crash and fall into this night with me 
 Look in my eyes 
 Tell I'm all right 
 I don't know if I'm still alive 
 If this is goodbye 
 Forever's just a lie 
 Big enough to make you wanna try 
 In just one life 
 How can we live enough to rest in peace? 
 In just one life 
 How can we live enough to rest in peace, now? 
 Here as I stand, head in hand 
 And one hand on my heart 
 As I depart, it's not so hard 
 One to day to become a man 
 You have your scars 
 But I never thought that you would give me mineI don't know what you want, and I don't wanna know. 
 I got you where I want, and I won't let go. 
 So get your kicks out quick, while you still got time. 
 That's fine. 
 I know just what you've done, I need no alibis. 
 I hope you had your fun, you sure know how to live. 
 'Cause you're just a drag, and you just ran out of time. 
 That's quite all right. 
 Well do what you want, 
 But don't be proud. 
 'Cause baby you don't wanna know. 
 What I'm gonna do when you're not around. 
 No baby you don't wanna know. 
 I got you right where I want. 
 And I bet you, gonna set you off. 
 And I tell you anything you want. 
 But baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 Hey. 
 It beats me black and blue, but I can't resist. 
 I'm dragging myself through, this kind of masochist. 
 But I'll be fine like this till the end of time. 
 That's quite all right. 
 Well do what you want, 
 But don't be proud. 
 'Cause baby you don't wanna know. 
 What I'm gonna do when you're not around. 
 No baby you don't wanna know. 
 I got you right where I want. 
 And I bet you, gonna set you off. 
 And I tell you anything you want. 
 But baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 It's all right, I don't mind. 
 'Cause you just might be out of time. 
 Well do what you want, 
 But don't be proud. 
 'Cause baby you don't wanna know. 
 What I'm gonna do when you're not around. 
 No baby you don't wanna know. 
 I got you right where I want. 
 And I bet you, gonna set you off. 
 And I tell you anything you want to hear. 
 But baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 Baby you don't wanna know. 
 No, no, baby you don't wanna know.Hold me now, 
 'Cause I couldn't even if I tried. 
 It's over now, 
 I guess it really is my time. 
 I don't wanna go, 
 But it's time I gotta say goodbye. 
 So hold me now, 
 'Cause this'll be our last time. 
 I'm slowing down, 
 And I don't think that I can fight. 
 I know somehow, 
 You'll find a way to live your life. 
 Remember just to live 
 Every day like it's your last. 
 And hold me now, 
 'Cause I think it's time for me to pass. 
 I don't want to die, 
 I don't know why, 
 This kind of fate was meant for me. 
 You gotta be strong, 
 Gotta move on, 
 It's not how it was supposed to be. 
 And what do I say? 
 It was never supposed to end up this way. 
 What do I have to do? 
 Was supposed to grow old with you. 
 But that ain't gonna happen. 
 No that ain't gonna happen. 
 Hold me now, 
 'Cause the time I've got's running out. 
 Now tears allowed, 
 Even though we've become without. 
 I just wanna feel 
 Your head laying on my chest. 
 So hold me now, 
 As I take my last breath. 
 I don't want to die, 
 I don't know why, 
 This kind of fate was meant for me. 
 You gotta be strong, 
 Gotta move on, 
 It's not how it was supposed to be. 
 And what do I say? 
 It was never supposed to end up this way. 
 What do I have to do? 
 Was supposed to grow old with you. 
 But that ain't gonna happen. 
 No that ain't gonna happen.Everybody's got their problems 
 Everybody says the same thing to you 
 It's just the matter how you solve them 
 And knowing how to change the things you've been through 
 I feel I've come to realize 
 How fast life can be compromised 
 Step back to see what's going on 
 I can't believe this happened to you 
 This happened to you 
 It's just a problem that I'm faced with 
 Am I not the only one who hates to stand by 
 Complications headed first in this line 
 With all these pictures running through my mind 
 Knowing endless 
 Consequences 
 I feel so useless in this 
 Get back, step back and as for me 
 I can't believe 
 Part of me, won't agree 
 'Cause I don't know if it's for sure 
 Suddenly, suddenly 
 I don't feel so insecure 
 Part of me, won't agree 
 'Cause I don't know if it's for sure 
 Suddenly, suddenly 
 I don't feel so insecure 
 Anymore 
 Everybody's got their problems 
 Everybody says the same thing to you 
 It's just the matter how you solve them 
 But what else are we supposed to do 
 Part of me, won't agree 
 'Cause I don't know if it's for sure 
 Suddenly, suddenly 
 I don't feel so insecure 
 Part of me, won't agree 
 'Cause I don't know if it's for sure 
 Suddenly, suddenly 
 I don't feel so insecure

 Why do things that matter the most 
 Never end up being what we chose 
 (Anymore) 
 Now that I find hell ain't so bad 
 I don't think I knew what I had 
 (Anymore) 
 Why do things that matter the most 
 Never end up being what we chose 
 (Anymore) 
 Now that I find hell ain't so bad 
 I don't think I knew what I hadLast call for regret and defeat 
 To finish the bottle full of empty dreams 
 Punch strong head that was straight out of line 
 Another excuse with no alibi 
 Hitchin on the road of decline 
 With no name streets and no vital signs 
 I pissed away the best of me and 
 No one can help me! 
 Misery's best friend 
 Can't be a dead-end 
 A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean 
 So feel it 
 Especially the rejects 
 A bad habit 
 Don't forget it you better 
 Count your last blessings 
 And fill up the wagon 
 Chases this fee 
 And now I'm running out of time 
 My hands are tied 
 And nailed to the cross 
 I'm looking for all the composure I lost 
 I'm petulant with a bad attitude 
 A poster-child vision of wasted youth 
 I dodged the book and found the key 
 I can't say the same for dignity 
 I pissed away the best of me and 
 No one can help me 
 Misery's best friend 
 Can't be a dead-end 
 A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean 
 So feel it 
 Especially the rejects 
 A bad habit 
 Don't forget it you better 
 Count your last blessings 
 And fill up the wagon 
 Chases this fee 
 And now I'm running out of time 
 My own enemy 
 I don't hear you now 
 Perfect tragedy 
 God bless us denial 
 My own enemy 
 I don't hear you now

 Chases this fee 
 And now I'm running out of timeThe seas have parted 
 The ending's started 
 The sky has turned to black 
 A killing spree through eternity 
 The devil stabs you in the back 
 It's midnight now, you must escape somehow 
 Torture is his leisure 
 Don't try to hide, he'll make you subside 
 As he exchanges pain for pleasure 
 Pain for pleasure 
 He's the hunter you're the game 
 Pain for pleasure 
 Satan is his name 
 Watch out!The little ones 
 We gotta control all the little ones 
 All the little ones 
 We'll take the souls of the little ones 
 And that might be you 
 Confess your sins of sorrow 
 Get on your knees and pray 
 Don't sell your souls on the open market 
 Cause there will be hell to pay 
 We're gonna burn 
 We're gonna burn this down 
 There's no return 
 In all the words we vow 
 If I am the king, then you might be my fancy 
 The little ones 
 We gotta control all the little ones 
 All the little ones 
 We'll take the souls of the little ones 
 And that might be you 
 We don't believe it's over 
 The season's of the dead 
 Just sell your souls for the lowest bargain 
 The price will be on your head 
 We're not alone 
 We're gonna bring you down 
 We'll take control 
 The new king is crowned 
 If I am the king, then you might be my fancy 
 The little ones 
 We gotta control all the little ones 
 All the little ones 
 We'll take the souls of the little ones 
 And that might be you 
 The little ones 
 We gotta control all the little ones 
 All the little ones 
 We'll take the souls of the little ones 
 And that might be you 
 The little ones 
 We gotta control all the little ones 
 All the little ones 
 We'll take the souls of the little ones 
 And that might be youAll bets are off but you still 
 Think that you've got a right well 
 You're lucky days are numbered now 
 (And you're to blame) 
 You built a castle of sand 
 Shaking the devil's hand well 
 At least I've still got my soul to sell 
 You've got to take me away 
 'Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel) 
 Something that's real (thing that's real) 
 Help me escape 
 'Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath) 
 Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death) 
 You played your part of the whore 
 You got some kinda nerve or 
 Have you forgot I don't forget? 
 (And your too late) 
 You walk beside the dead where 
 The angels never tread well 
 At least I've still got a soul to sell 
 You've got to take me away 
 'Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel) 
 Something that's real (thing that's real) 
 Help me escape 
 'Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath) 
 Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death) 
 There's nowhere to run 
 From hell and above 
 I swear to god that someday 
 There will be blood 
 It all comes down in the end in spite of me you do it again 
 It all comes down in the end in spite of you I'll do it again 
 You've got to take me away 
 'Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel) 
 Something that's real (thing that's real) 
 Help me escape 
 'Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath) 
 Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death)Oh my love how do I explain 
 How I've come to feel this way 
 I'm addicted to the pain even more than words can say 
 Every hit hurts like your kiss 
 Like a needle to a vein 
 My last words of this begin, I want you 
 She said you don't even know 
 Just how much I need it 
 How far will you go? 
 I just want to feel you cum 
 You make me so crazy but I'm ok 
 Just pain me and take it very slow 
 'Cause I'm in love tonight 
 So now that it has come to this 
 I'll be your dirty little thrill 
 For the world I wouldn't miss 
 'Cause I just wanna feel you kill 
 Self-inflicted masochist 
 How could anyone resist 
 My last words of this begin I want you 
 She said you don't even know 
 Just how much I need it 
 How far will you go? 
 (I just want to feel you cum) 
 You make me so crazy but I'm ok 
 Just pain me and take it very slow 
 'Cause I'm in love tonight 
 Tell me the difference between love and death 
 You feel them both as they take your breath 
 Tell me the difference between love and death 
 You feel them both as they take your breath 
 And all of this comes to an end 
 But I cannot resist your death 
 She said you don't even know 
 Just how much I need it 
 How far will you go 
 I just want to feel you cum 
 You make me so crazy but I'm ok 
 Just pain me and take it very slow 
 'Cause I'm in love tonight 
 She said you don't even know 
 Just how much I need it 
 How far will you go 
 (I just want to feel you cum) 
 You make me so crazy but I'm ok 
 Just pain me and take it very slow 
 'Cause I'm in love tonightI've dethroned the king of contradiction 
 Or were you just a jester all along a simple pawn 
 Don't you know you can't count 
 Your tears like your money 
 Running down like rain in the drain 
 You don't need to pray for me'cause I'm not the one to blame 
 I can't wait to see you going down in flames 
 How could it be know not what we've became 
 You lost the human race 
 I hope you burn like a cigarette in ashes 
 As your head comes down and crashes 
 Your throat pours blood from slashes 
 And I hope you never forget like a tattoo of regret 
 This time, this time 
 You don't need to pray for me 'cause I'm not the one to blame 
 I can't wait to see you going down in flames 
 How could it be know not what we've became 
 You lost the human race 
 Now you're replaced, now 
 Nice to know you, now 
 Your time is up so 
 Just drop deadThere's nothing left to say 
 'Cause you don't want to try 
 And I don't want the pain. 
 There's nothing let to do. 
 I don't want the lies, 
 And you don't feel the same. 
 It's time to let you go 
 And bow out of the game 
 And maybe we will find 
 The answers through the blame. 
 It's time for me to go. 
 It's time for me to go.And I'm up and I don't know why 
 But I guess that's all that counts 
 Looking 'round as I'm holding my head 
 And I'm in somebody's house 
 The sun it hits like a punch in the face 
 With a headache I can't ignore 
 Seems almost every weekend my bed is someone's floor 
 And so I can't keep this up 
 I have had enough 
 Eating cold pizza on the side of the curb 
 To cover up my morning breath of gin 
 Something doesn't seem to sit with me right 
 It's going out the way it went in 
 And so I can't keep this up 
 I have had enough 
 'Cause you can count me out 
 I'm on to you 
 'Cause you can count me out 
 I'm tired of leaving my embarassments behindGoddamn I'm dead again, woe is me 
 Seems to be that I'm a wanted man these days 
 I'm down that rabbit hole and I don't wanna go 
 Rot in peace on a dead-end street 
 I believe I hear them call, but they're ringing out of key 
 They're saying "listen boy may god rest your soul" 
 Got a lease on borrowed time 
 It's catching up to me 
 (Now let it bleed) 
 It's off with his head, and on with the show 
 The old king is dead, got one fatal blow 
 And I don't believe he will come back for more 
 Taking the crown of the brand new low 
 Take a look around you really blew it all to hell 
 What's the point of trying unless you're gonna do it well 
 So get off my back if I'm a god damn misery 
 And let it bleed (Yeah let it bleed) 
 It's off with his head, and on with the show 
 The old king is dead, got one fatal blow 
 And I don't believe he will come back for more 
 Taking the crown of the brand new low 
 It's off with his head, and on with the show 
 The old king is dead, got one fatal blow 
 And I don't believe he will come back for more 
 Taking the crown of the brand new lowI've got my scars to bear 
 Stitches just can't repair 
 There's no one to blame this time 
 Absolution's waiting on a prayer 
 I'm breaking down the walls 
 Unveiling my share of faults 
 This blood on my hands, is a blessing 
 In a lifetime, twisted by design 
 (And I'm so alive) 
 Is it a threat or the cure 
 'Cause it's a brave new world 
 I don't know if I'm ready for 
 Just a test 
 'Cause I'm miles up above you 
 Flying with no safety net 
 I don't believe in fate although 
 This time I think I've met my match 
 Why are the dreams so hard to catch 
 Cause you forget in time 
 What it feels inside 
 You live right on the line 
 (And I'm so alive) 
 They say believing is the hardest part 
 When I say with every beat of my heart 
 I alone will find my way 
 And get right back to the start 
 They say the fire in your heart is gone 
 But I say it's really only just begun 
 All along I know that I'm 
 I'm twisted by design 
 I'm twisted by design 
 I'm taking the days as they come 
 But now I'm seeing the world as if it had a thousand suns 
 I admit that there's somewhere along the lines 
 I guess I lost my grip 
 But luck has turned the page 
 And time is all I need to get things right 
 One more chance to catch the light 
 Cause you forget in time 
 What it feels inside 
 You live right on the line 
 (But I'm so alive) 
 They say believing is the hardest part 
 When I say with every beat of my heart 
 I alone will find my way 
 And get right back to the start 
 They say the fire in your heart is gone 
 But I say it's really only just begun 
 All along I know that I'm 
 I'm twisted by design 
 I'm twisted by design 
 Starting over again, but the further I get 
 I can't stop these walls from closing in 
 Going out of my head, all the tears that I've bled 
 They're not enough to take my pain away 
 They say believing is the hardest part 
 When I say with every beat of my heart 
 I alone will find my way 
 And get right back to the start 
 They say the fire in your heart is gone 
 But I say it's really only just begun 
 All along I know that I'm 
 I'm twisted by design 
 I'm twisted by design 
 In some ways I've changed 
 And I've left it all behind 
 But I can't change the way 
 That I'm, I'm twisted by designDon't know what you really got 
 It's hard to stay and not pretend 
 Can't make sense in what you thought 
 Seems I can't comprehend 
 I'm happy to be 
 Only all that you see 
 And I'm not one to learn, to be the same 
 I don't wanna hear you bitch no more 
 I was better off a year before 
 No matter how I try, I can't ignore 
 Every time I think my brain is sore 
 When I'm with you... 
 What's so hard about goodbyes 
 I'm sorry I'm just not as keen 
 I'm planning out a perfect life 
 When I'm only nineteen 
 I'm happy to be 
 Only all that you see 
 And I'm not one to learn, to be the same 
 I don't want to try and just be friends 
 Nothing's gonna change my mind again 
 And never hear the thoughts I had were dead 
 I can't even think inside my head 
 When I'm with you... 
 I'm in my way 
 Can't you see that's the truth 
 So long can't stay 
 Won't you see that's the truth 
 I'm in my way 
 Can't you see that's the truth 
 So long can't stay 
 Won't you see that's the, see that's the, see that's the 
 Last that I could take 
 Because it's getting really hard to fake 
 It's not like it's my problem that you're in 
 But can't you just spare the lives I hate 
 When I'm with you...It's hard enough to even fake a smile 
 Disillusioned, I admit denial 
 There's something missing cause I can't feel a thing 
 I'm desensitized 
 You can't fake this, and 
 I can't take anymore - I'm numb 
 So dumb I can't ignore 
 You can't fake this, and 
 I can't take anymore - I'm numb 
 So dumb I can't ignore 
 Anymore 
 All this confusion is running deep inside my head 
 How long can I keep this up before I end up dead? 
 I can't believe that it could come to this 
 It's only feelings, though I can't resist 
 I'm falling deeper in denial, but I still try to 
 Believe in something 
 You can't fake this, and 
 I can't take anymore - I'm numb 
 So dumb I can't ignore 
 You can't fake this, and 
 I can't take anymore - I'm numb 
 So dumb I can't ignore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 AnymoreThere's no doubt in my mind when it's over 
 What is done will be 
 You will find when life gets colder, there's no sympathy 
 There's no point trying - You can't escape the bitter end 
 Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end? 
 All your choices chosen - You've got no say 
 Your decisions made 
 Face your consequences as your life begins to fade 
 As time keeps spinning closer to the bitter end 
 Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end? 
 Take a look at yourself as time keeps racing 
 Is all you've come to be 
 What you expected, or are you still chasing possibilities 
 Cause all your prayers won't save you from the bitter end 
 Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end? 
 The bitter end 
 The bitter endHanging by a thread now, my head's down 
 Not feeling like myself now 
 The voices inside my head are getting too loud 
 (Screaming louder than a thousand drums) 
 I keep counting the days and I can't stop now 
 And I won't break down, I'm too proud 
 Let's give them shit to talk about 
 The pressure, the weight of the world won't keep me down 
 (This time I'm taking back what's mine) 
 It's been a long time coming and I just won't stop 
 Go 
 Go ahead then try to break me 
 Like a rat in a race until the dawn 
 Go ahead then make them pay 
 It's time to take back the place where I belong 
 So, I'm done will all the chasing 
 I'm giving up on wasting 
 All my time with with you, now I'm looking for salvation 
 I'm done with all the fake shit, getting hard to fake it 
 'Cause I can't take it anymore so give me something sacred 
 I played the part of the villain but no apologies given 
 I came right back to the start, and it's about time for living 
 I've been to hell and back still, I've paid the devil his bills 
 And now I'm coming back stronger, and I'm shooting just to kill 
 Go ahead then try to break me 
 Like a rat in a race until the dawn 
 Go ahead then make them pay 
 It's time to take back the place where I belong 
 The place where I belong 
 The place where I belong 
 The place where I belong 
 And fade into the stars 
 The race until the dawn 
 And I just wanna take my place 
 The place where I belong 
 And fade into the stars 
 The race until the dawn 
 And I just wanna take my place 
 The place where I belong 
 Won't stop 
 Go ahead then try to break me 
 Like a rat in a race until the dawn 
 Go ahead then make them pay 
 It's time to take back the place where I belong 
 Go ahead then try to break me 
 Like a rat in a race until the dawn 
 Go ahead then make them pay 
 It's time to take back the place where I belong 
 The place where I belong 
 The place where I belongI'm slippin' away 
 In every way 
 I can't stay awake 
 (And I don't know why) 
 I'm slippin' away 
 (And I don't know why) 
 I'm tryin' to make it through each day 
 I'm fallin' apart now in every way 
 I'm findin' it harder to get by 
 There's a hole in my heart 
 And I don't know why 
 Now I've come to realize 
 I'm slippin' awaySo what am I fighting for? 
 Everything back and more 
 And I'm not gonna let this go 
 I'm ready to settle the score 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 There are days that I think I'm crazy 
 Other days nothing seems to faze me 
 There's nothing more and nothing less 
 Just all the fears that I must confess well 
 I'm afraid I believe in nothing 
 No hopes or dreams you could've left me dead 
 Naive and not to mention 
 I'm losing count of all my blessings 
 With all that I've done, it's too late 
 I can't take back all that I have become 
 So all that I'm trying to say 
 I'm looking for a better way 
 Some days it just gets so hard 
 And I don't wanna slip away 
 So what am I fighting for? 
 Everything back and more 
 And I'm not gonna let this go 
 I'm ready to settle the score 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 Another day in the right direction 
 I'm ok but I'm left to question 
 How did I get so far behind the rest? 
 Why am I so inclined to forget? 
 All the days that you made me crazy 
 Nowadays you don't even faze me 
 It's all the same and I don't stress none 
 Sick and tired of all this tension 
 With all that I've done, it's too late 
 I can't take back all that I have become 
 So all that I'm trying to say 
 I'm looking for a better way 
 Some days it just gets so hard 
 And I don't wanna slip away 
 So what am I fighting for? 
 Everything back and more 
 And I'm not gonna let this go 
 I'm ready to settle the score 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 All that I'm trying to say 
 I'm looking for a better way 
 Some days it just gets so hard 
 And I don't wanna slip away 
 So what am I fighting for? 
 Everything back and more 
 And I'm not gonna let this go 
 I'm ready to settle the score 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 I'm looking for a better way 
 Some days it just gets so hard 
 And I don't wanna slip away 
 Get ready cause this is war 
 Everything back and more 
 And I'm not gonna let this go 
 I'm ready to settle the score 
 Get ready cause this is warI need this to get me through 
 Can't resist - Don't want to 
 Believe it - I know it's true 
 Can't beat it - Don't want to try 
 A perfect hell 
 It's more to me than you ever will know 
 Down here where the rest of us fell 
 Waste away - Nothing left to show 
 While I'm in this perfect hell 
 Obsession has begun 
 Possessed by destruction 
 How did I get so low 
 Believe me - No one knows 
 Sometimes I can't hold on 
 And no one can help me 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 I don't think I can make it through this 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 The less I do the more it makes no sense 
 I'm walking pollution who's drained by delusions 
 On the verge of destruction, I cave in to abduction 
 Thin blood I'm bleeding - Pulse won't stop racing 
 Just as my heart explodes 
 No chance that I could win 
 Too hard to not give in 
 I just don't feel the same 
 Cause I'm the one to blame 
 Sometimes I can't hold on 
 And no one can help me 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 I don't think I can make it through this 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 The less I do the more it makes no sense 
 I need this to be myself 
 It feels like I need some help 
 It's too late to save myself 
 Or it's just in my head 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 I don't think I can make it through this 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 The less I do the more it makes no sense 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 I don't think I can make it through this 
 Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me) 
 The less I do the more it makes no senseSo am I still waiting 
 For this world to stop hating 
 Can't find a good reason 
 Can't find hope to believe in 
 Drop dead, a bullet to my head 
 Your words are like a gun in hand 
 You can't change the state of the nation 
 We just need some motivation 
 These eyes have seen no conviction 
 Just lies and more contradiction 
 So tell me, what would you say 
 I'd say its time too late 
 So am I still waiting 
 For this world to stop hating 
 Can't find a good reason 
 Can't find hope to believe in 
 Ignorance and understanding 
 We're the first ones to jump in line 
 Out of step for what we believe in 
 But who's left to stop the bleeding 
 How far will we take this 
 It's not hard to see through the fakeness 
 So tell me, what would you say 
 I'd say its time too late 
 So am I still waiting 
 For this world to stop hating 
 Can't find a good reason 
 Can't find hope to believe 
 This can't last forever 
 Time won't make things better 
 I feel so alone 
 Can't help myself 
 And no one knows 
 If this is worthless 
 Tell me 
 So 
 What have we done 
 We're in a war that can't be won 
 This can't be real 
 'Cause I don't know what to feel 
 So am I still waiting 
 For this world to stop hating 
 Can't find a good reason 
 Can't find hope to believe 
 So am I still waiting 
 For this world to stop hating 
 Can't find a good reason 
 For this world to believeI'm going it alone 
 Did my time and now I'm done 
 It's so easy 
 All the faces that I see don't mean anything at all to me 
 But you got me going now out of my mind 
 And it's all a hell of a time 
 I don't wanna say what I don't mean 
 But I'm trying just to let you know 
 That I don't wanna cause a scene 
 But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go 
 I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear 
 'Cause it's true 
 I'd give you all I got but there's nothing there that you could use 
 But you got me going now out of my mind 
 And it's all a hell of a time with you know 
 I don't wanna say what I don't mean 
 But I'm trying just to let you know 
 That I don't wanna cause a scene 
 But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go 
 I don't wanna say what I don't mean 
 But I'm trying just to let you know 
 That I don't wanna cause a scene 
 But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go 
 I'll tell you anything that you know you never wanna hear 
 'Cause it's true 
 I'd give you all I got but I'm the only thing you use 
 So you got me going now 
 I don't wanna say what I don't mean 
 But I'm trying just to let you know 
 That I don't wanna cause a scene 
 But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go 
 I don't wanna say what I don't mean 
 But I'm trying just to let you know 
 That I don't wanna cause a scene 
 But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to goDon't come to me with your problems - I don't need them 
 Your conscience is a weight that I won't hold 
 You'd rather be the only who pretends 
 Is it cause you've been bought and sold so young? 
 Don't ask me questions - Cause I don't got the answers 
 If you only knew what time would tell 
 It's all a test and lessons that you can't learn 
 You'll know when you spend your time in Hell 
 So as your blood's running thin, your time's running out 
 No one will be listening - Not even when you shout 
 When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out 
 That no one will be with you in the end 
 A hypocrite - You're just a contradiction 
 Wrapped up in your lies - Who knows what's real? 
 Well, this is it - Your lonely life of fiction 
 Do you even know how to feel? 
 So as your blood's running thin, your time's running out 
 No one will be listening - Not even when you shout 
 When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out 
 That no one will be with you in the end 
 So as your blood's running thin, your time's running out 
 No one will be listening - Not even when you shout 
 When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out 
 That no one will be with you in the end 
 The end 
 The end 
 The endYou said it once before 
 You don't do those things you used to anymore 
 You say in doubt 
 We're fading out 
 Forgetting who we used to be 
 'Cause I will bring you down 
 I don't want to miss 
 I don't think you can handle this 
 You've lost what you can't find 
 Never what you had in mind 
 You take it with a smile 
 It's so easy when you're always in denial 
 Just in time 
 But out of line 
 I can't make all the same mistakes you want me to 
 'Cause I will bring you down 
 I don't want to miss 
 I don't think you can handle this 
 You've lost what you can't find 
 Never what you had in mind 
 You're giving up 
 You know it's not what you need 
 And it's true what you're going through 
 Try so hard not to listen to everything I never say 
 'Cause I will bring you down 
 I don't want to miss 
 I don't think you can handle this 
 'Cause I will bring you down 
 I don't want to miss 
 And I don't think you can handle this 
 You've lost what you can't find 
 Never what you had in mind 
 I'm getting over getting used to 
 And after all that I put you through 
 Now I see I'M NOT the only one 
 Never thought it'd ever come to 
 This in fact was never what you wanted from me 
 OR HOW you meant it to be 
 I'm getting over getting used to (you've lost what you can't find) 
 And after all that I put you through 
 Now I see I'M NOT the only one 
 Never thought it'd ever come to (you've lost what you can't find) 
 This in fact was never what you wanted from me 
 OR HOW you meant it to beAlways 
 The whole way through 
 I'll stay true 
 Calling your name out 
 If you could only hear me now 
 Words I have never said so loud 
 The choice I would never be without 
 I'll be with you always (always) 
 Know that all these words are... 
 Now that I can feel something I never thought was real 
 I'll be with you always (always) 
 Know that all these words are true 
 Calling your name out 
 If you could only hear me now 
 Words I have never said so loud 
 The choice I would never be without 
 I'll be with you always (always) 
 Know that all these words are... 
 Now that I can feel something I never thought was real 
 I'll be with you always (always) 
 Know that all these words are true 
 If you stay then I won't go 
 If you go, I'll always be there 
 I don't care 
 All I know 
 If you stay then I won't go 
 If you go, I'll always be there 
 I'll be there, I don't care, I don't care 
 'Cause always, I knowThis place reminds me of 
 A time that's way too old 
 These thoughts have gathered up the memories unfold 
 But for now I don't see what's so wrong with pretending 
 It's true I thought you knew 
 Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time 
 Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime 
 Believe her, It's all she's got to keep things right 
 Believe her, it's all she's got it's all she's got 
 It's all she's got, it's all she's got 
 These day keep getting worse I'm wasting all my time 
 Thought I'd come in first instead I fell behind 
 I don't know, I don't know if I can keep this up to long. 
 It seems most every time my motives are all wrong 
 But for now 
 I don't see what's so wrong with pretending 
 It's true I thought you knew 
 Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time 
 Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime 
 Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right 
 Believe her, it's all she's got, it's all she's got 
 It's times like this, my time's run out 
 It's times like this, my time's run out 
 It's times like this. my time's run out 
 It's times like this, I want to 
 Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time 
 Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime 
 Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right 
 Believe her, it's all she's got, it's all she's gotHow can we fake this and take anymore 
 Look at it blindly and try to ignore? 
 It's better to miss, it, is no point of view 
 It's only a problem when it happens to you 
 Well, thanks for making this so easy 
 What's the point if it's so easy? 
 Why the fuck is it so easy? 
 And what's it going to take? 
 Cause we're doing fine 
 And we don't need to be told 
 That we're doing fine 
 Cause we won't give you control 
 And we don't need anything from you 
 And we'll be just fine 
 Cause we won't be bought and sold 
 Just like you 
 Lies are the standard when nothing is true 
 Don't be surprised when it comes back to you 
 Are you on a mission to lose all control 
 Or waiting for tragedy to unfold? 
 What makes you think that it's so easy? 
 Don't believe it will be so easy 
 Why the fuck would it be so easy? 
 What's it going to take? 
 Cause we're doing fine 
 And we don't need to be told 
 That we're doing fine 
 Cause we won't give you control 
 And we don't need anything from you 
 And we'll be just fine 
 Cause we won't be bought and sold 
 Just like you 
 So how long has this gone? 
 I don't see this ending 
 It's too late - We can't change 
 What has now begun 
 We act like it's not right 
 Why are we pretending? 
 We've been wrong for so long 
 We've known this all along 
 You created these problems 
 And you don't know what to do 
 You know you can solve them 
 But you can't be bothered to 
 You created these problems 
 And you don't know what to do

 And we'll be just fine 
 Cause we won't be bought and sold 
 Just like youPerfection is my direction 
 Even if that's all I had 
 It's not like I need no correction 
 I just know that life's not so bad 
 Picture this everyday kids that just can't find a way 
 Stuck in disarray can't find hope for better days 
 It's the degeneration of childhood frustration 
 In the last 30 years 
 Teenage suicide has increased 300% in North America; 
 It is the second major cause of death in Canada 
 Perfection is my direction 
 Even if that's all I had 
 It's not like I need no correction 
 I just know that life's not so bad 
 When will all my problems disappear 
 Am I just going crazy from the fear 
 Oh my oh my I'm going far past the brink 
 The pressure's like a weight 
 And I still can't think straight 
 Perfection is my direction 
 Even if that's all I had 
 It's not like I need no correction 
 I just know that life's not so bad 
 I've met my destinations 
 So what's left to complain about 
 With all these aggravations 
 Building till the seams fall out 
 I'm running my mouth dry 
 With every time I lie 
 Don't tell me without a doubt 
 This dumbfound luck has all run out 
 Don't tell me without a doubt 
 This dumbfound luck has all run out 
 Perfection is my direction 
 Even if that's all I had 
 It's not like I need no correction 
 I just know that life's not so bac(Where'd I go wrong?) 
 Pull the curtains begin paranoia's wearing thin now 
 It's wearing thin now 
 (Where'd I go wrong?) 
 Close my eyes realize I've become the victimized now 
 Desensitized now 
 The one and only day has come. I pay for all the bad things I've done. 
 (Where'd I go wrong?) 
 Something's wrong because I find the glamour in the dark side 
 In the dark side 
 (Where'd I go wrong?) 
 Cheap regrets, can't forget, falling victim to the debts still. 
 Unpaid in my mind. 
 The one and only day has come. I pay for all the bad things I've done. 
 It's gonna take me, you don't know tragedy 
 I've been to hell and back again to tell it 
 Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep 
 I fear the worst; my beating heart ticks to explode 
 My time is up so... 
 Why can't I just die!? 
 Living dead awake the horror show begins so pull the curtains over me... 
 Bring on the panic the uncontrolled and manic 
 It's a free-for-all kill them all every last one of them 
 I don't care at all 
 Suffocate the dreams in my mind 
 (I can't stop believing) 
 Drown the thoughts that have me confined 
 (Stop this heart from bleeding) 
 Gutter dreams as black as the night 
 (Bombed and dead utopia) 
 No one told me empathy's a lie 
 (Lost in paranoia) 
 Suffocate the dreams in my mind 
 (My last words I'm choking, are all my dreams broken?) (I can't stop believing) 
 Drown the thoughts that have me confined 
 (The silence is defeating, my ears won't stop ringing.) (Stop this heart from bleeding) 
 Gutter dreams as black as the night 
 (My last words I'm choking, are all my dreams broken?) (Bombed and dead utopia) 
 No one told me empathy's a lie 
 (The silence is defeating, my ears won't stop ringing.) (Lost in paranoia) 
 Now we're gone 
 Do you still feel the same, well now 
 Can't you see, I need help? 
 To stop before myself 
 Can't you help me now?Another day wasted out of time 
 I can't get out of this 
 Altered state of mind 
 I'm going overboard 
 My conscience meets decline 
 Into reality 
 I know this can't be fine 
 'Cause I'm all messed up 
 Making perfect nonsense 
 Drowning in my doubt 
 Too well 
 'Cause I'm all messed up 
 Going nowhere fast 
 These circles in my mind 
 So blind 
 Who are these voices in my head 
 I can't go on like this 
 Living like the dead 
 I havent slept so long 
 Feeling sad I dread 
 I'm talking to myself 
 Forgot what I just said 
 Well I hold my only enemy 
 As closely as a friend 
 And I sold my own reality 
 To further my decent 
 Self destruction taking over 
 It's so easy to pretend 
 Introduction to this nightmare 
 Though it seems it may never end 
 Can anyone help me drag my heels 
 I'm running overtime 
 I can't hold down my meals 
 My mind is racing by 
 Staring blankly feels 
 Like pulling out my teeth 
 While this tension windsAh 
 Not enough you passed it for a while, 
 You can't afford the amass of denial. 
 Don't explain, you can't arcane it too. 
 Your lies surpassed your doubt. 
 Don't do something you'll regret (x2) 
 Ah 
 Not enough you passed it for a while, 
 Your minds mistake, 
 The time you take, 
 Time worth throwing all away. 
 It's not enough attention, 
 Though you're too proud to mention, 
 I can't go on pretending, 
 That it's still the same (x6)While looking for the answers, 
 Only questions come to mind. 
 'Cause I've been lost in circles 
 Wish seems now for quite some time. 
 And I don't know how I came here, 
 Even how I got this far. 
 All I can tell you, is my fate 
 Is written in the black stars. 
 Well, what am I supposed to do? 
 Bless myself, 
 This perfect hell of my own 
 Is the best I've ever known. 
 Tell me something I don't want to know. 
 'Cause I can't believe so. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I've become sick of everyone now. 
 And I don't feel remorse for the forgotten. 
 And I don't care at all. 
 I've become sick of everyone now. 
 And I don't pray to voice all of the problems. 
 And I don't care at all. 
 Take me away, 
 I'm sick of everyone, today. 
 I'm not okay, 
 But I'm fine this way. 
 I need no change 
 To take me away 
 I'm coming down, fell apart. 
 It's hard to keep together when you don't know where to start. 
 I've become sick of everyone now. 
 And I don't feel remorse for the forgotten. 
 And I don't care at all. 
 I've become sick of everyone now. 
 And I don't pray to voice all of the problems. 
 I'm sick of everyone.Can't step in my way 
 Headfirst into love and dismay 
 It's like beating the dead 
 (I guess it's over then) 
 I can't stop going out on my head 
 Whatever this could be I'd never know 
 I never said it'd be the end all to be all 
 I hate you today 
 I can't find a way 
 Don't drag me down now 
 Goodbye 
 I've had enough frustration 
 I won't get stuck 
 Goodbye 
 This dead end situation 
 Is just not worth my time 
 It's no better today 
 I never thought it would end up this way 
 You've got something to say 
 (You've got something to say) 
 Don't want to hear if it gets in my way 
 (All) this confusion, wondering, so overwhelmed 
 (All) Disillusion seems so clear 
 (Can't) find your conclusion, disappointing evolution 
 Not (all) things are what they appear 
 So what's the point of this hell 
 I know you too well 
 We're running backwards 
 Goodbye 
 I've had enough frustration 
 I won't get stuck 
 Goodbye 
 This dead end situation 
 Is just not worth my time 
 Bomb waiting so frustrating 
 I'm so sick of 
 All this tension not to mention 
 I'm so sick of 
 Can't take it 
 We won't make it 
 Just save yourself this trouble 
 Can't take it quite for yourself 
 'Cause I'm just fine 
 You speak for all of us when you can't be heard 
 (I can't help you any more than) 
 I bet you haven't listened to not one word 
 (I have helped myself before) 
 You speak for all of us when 
 (So sick of you, so sick of) 
 You can't be heard 
 (So sick of you, so sick of) 
 I bet you haven't listened 
 (So sick of you, so sick of) 
 To not one word 
 (So sick of you, so sick) 
 Goodbye 
 I've had enough frustration 
 I won't get stuck 
 Goodbye 
 This dead end situation 
 Is just not worth my time 
 But waiting so frustrating 
 I'm so sick of 
 All this tension not to mention 
 I'm so sick of 
 Sick of youTake a look around you 
 Consequence surrounds you 
 I would cross my heart and hope to die. 
 You should thank your lucky stars, and 
 Count your fading scars, cause 
 No one said you had to live a lie. 
 Too late my friend, it's over (memories broken) 
 Nice to know ya', 
 Guess that means this is goodbye. 
 Days will come and go by, 
 You will never know why 
 You're the victim of your own denial. 
 You took the vow of contradiction 
 Bound by lies and fiction 
 Holding onto nothing all the while. 
 Too late my friend, it's over (memories broken) 
 Nice to know ya', 
 Guess that means this is goodbye. 
 This is goodbye. 
 So nice to know ya'. 
 Time has come and gone, 
 This is goodbye. 
 This is goodbye. 
 So nice to know ya'. 
 Time has come and gone, 
 This is goodbye. 
 Guess that means this is goodbye. 
 This is goodbye. 
 So nice to know ya'. 
 Time has come and gone, 
 This is goodbye. 
 This is goodbye. 
 So nice to know ya'. 
 Time has come and gone, 
 This is goodbye.Yeah! 
 Alright!(Echo twice) 
 The year is 3468 
 And they're about to eliminate 
 Life as we all know it on Planet Earth 
 They're products of a new regime 
 With manufactured designer genes 
 Scientifically enhanced at birth 
 Superior in almost every way 
 With telepathic DNA 
 They'll hunt you down there's nowhere you can hide 
 Created for the killing machine 
 Proto-nuclear human beings 
 We must help to prevent this genocide 
 Have we created, our own demise 
 Their out to kill, using their minds 
 You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
 Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
 Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up 
 It seems the time has come for the human race 
 Gone for good, vanishing without a trace 
 Cerebroids are silencing their cries 
 The clones are trying to assist evolution 
 Through state sponsored executions 
 Will nothing stop this evil enterprise? 
 Until the day a leader emerges 
 With mind powers like electric surges 
 He'll give us hope, he'll teach us how to fight 
 A clash of arms with the enemy 
 And outcome no can forsee 
 Let's pray they can't withstand our human right 
 Have we created, our own demise 
 Their out to kill, using their minds 
 You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
 Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
 Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is up 
 Have we created, our own demise 
 Their out to kill, using their minds 
 You'll feel the chill, run down your spine 
 Tell me, since when has being human been a crime? 
 Gonna hunt you, gonna get you, Your time is upWhat's the difference of never knowing at all? 
 When every step I take is always too small. 
 Maybe it's just something I can't admit 
 But lately, I feel like I don't give a shit 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations don't know how to take them, 
 Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
 Concentration never hard to break it. 
 Situation never what you want it to be. 
 What's the point of never making mistakes? 
 Self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break. 
 It's all just a waste of time in the end. 
 Don't care, so why should I even pretend? 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations don't know how to take them, 
 Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
 Concentration never hard to break it. 
 Situation never what you want it... 
 Nothing's new, everything's the same. 
 Keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame. 
 Falling further behind, there's nothing to explain. 
 No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind. 
 Can't depend, on doubt until the end. 
 It seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend 
 And though I can't pretend, I'm framed to be this way 
 It's not the same but who's to blame 
 For all the stupid things I never said? 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations don't know how to take them, 
 Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
 Concentration never hard to break it. 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations don't know where to take them, 
 Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
 Concentration, situation never what you want it to be. 
 Never what you want it to be. 
 Never what you want it to be.Take the pictures off the wall 
 Erase The thoughts, forget them all 
 The choice is yours to save yourself 
 Or in the hands of someone else 
 Broken thoughts and alibis 
 Conscience disappears in time 
 A voice is all that I can show 
 All that I have is a soul 
 Yeah 
 You're set up to failure 
 A dead-beat on parade 
 With a foot in the gutter 
 And the other in the grave 
 You've cursed your silver spoon so black 
 So die 
 Well what can I say? 
 Guess it's obvious you would end up this way, 
 When you live amongst the dead. 
 The best of luck, 
 As the one and only resident scumfuck 
 A victim or just a tragedy? 
 I hear you talk 
 But I don't hear you speak 
 You don't make sense, 
 Your mind is incomplete 
 I can't believe all the things that you say 
 You just can't get enough 
 We'll all be waiting here just for the day 
 Guess your time is up 
 Well what can I say? 
 Guess it's obvious you would end up this way, 
 When you live amongst the dead 
 The best of luck, 
 As the one and only resident scumfuck 
 A victim or just a tragedy? 
 All that I need is time for me to breathe 
 Dream little dreams that only I believe 
 Now that I see beyond the light, 
 I'm gonna be, I'll be all rightSome say we're never meant to grow up 
 I'm sure they never knew enough 
 I know the pressures won't go 
 Away - It's too late 
 Find out we're different somehow 
 It's too late to even have faith 
 Don't think things will ever change 
 You must be dreaming 
 Think before you make up your mind 
 You don't seem to realize 
 I can do this on my own 
 And if I fall, I'll take it all 
 (No "with me", no "with you") 
 It's so easy after all 
 Believe me - Coz now's the time to try 
 Don't wait - The chance will pass you by 
 Time's up to figure it out 
 You can't say it's too late 
 Seems like everything we knew 
 Turned out were never even true 
 Don't trust things will ever change 
 You must be dreaming (Dreaming) 
 Think before you make up your mind 
 You don't seem to realize 
 I can do this on my own 
 And if I fall, I'll take it all 
 (No "with me", no "with you") 
 It's so easy after all 
 Some say we're better off without 
 Knowing what life is all about 
 I'm sure they'll never realize 
 The way it's too late 
 Somehow it's different everyday 
 In some ways it never fades away 
 Seems like it's never gonna change 
 I must be dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming) 
 Think before you make up your mind 
 You don't seem to realize 
 I can do this on my own 
 Think before you make up your mind 
 You don't seem to realize 
 I can do this on my own 
 And if I fall, I'll take it all 
 (No "with me", no "with you") 
 It's so easy after all 
 Believe me - It's alright 
 It's so easy after all 
 Believe me - It's alright 
 It's so easy after all
