 Unlike you say say why does it feel like the air wet you

 When your castle breaks 
 And your feet are dry 
 Do you believe when youre high 
 That your life is tried 
 Dont you ever get stuck in the sky 
 Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre high 
 When your moon is fake 
 And your mermaids cry 
 Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky 
 When your tunnel fades 
 And your guide is shy 
 Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre highFish that dont drown 
 Life in a bubble jungle 
 I wouldnt frown 
 Not short another chuckle 
 Snake in the ground 
 But I was in there for you 
 Now leaving town 
 Seeing you believing 
 Us adhering 
 Were the power struck 
 Believing then kneeling 
 Appeasing 
 The power struggle 
 Were left with no arms 
 Right in the power struggle 
 Wearing the crown 
 Chasing a clown 
 But I was waiting for you 
 Now we have found 
 Left with no arms 
 In the power struggle 
 May I remind you 
 Your life is in a bubble jungle 
 Right here in the power struggle

 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves 
 The senses collect undeniable data 
 About beta carotine and thetawaves 
 The unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Then the senses wanted the sky  
 All rise eyes BOW 
 Time feels like a midnight ride 
 Finality waits outside 
 Weeping in perplexitys arms 
 Caressing our smiles inside  
 The national debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves 
 The people collect undeniable data 
 About high pulse weapons and microwaves 
 Then the people found out the lie  
 Now our eyes have been found 
 Caressing our smiles inside 
 Waiting to get you high 
 Waiting to touch the sky 
 Caressing our smiles inTime is always now and forever 
 Time is always now or never 
 God is now the ruler of the present 
 His son a lesson born of a peasant 
 Here now forever 
 Happiness ends at the end of a beautiful tunnel 
 Now forever 
 Run run run away 
 To a land far away 
 Where the hills are green and the water is gray 
 Maria ran with passion not seen in women 
 Thanks to the big life and her forceful daddy 
 No longer the man 
 No matter 
 Due is her freedom for loneliness with the dollar 
 No longer the man no matter 
 Ive been poisoned by God 
 The devil of money 
 I will never marry till Im ready 
 To be the perfect man 
 Husband of a dream 
 Honey the babysitters here 
 Honey its 8 OClock

 But it was her strange way 
 Of tellin me bout her 
 Fuck 
 She told me that she was the one 
 And then everything was done 
 And then I looked around 
 What did I see 
 Well I fucked her 
 Right underneath the tree 
 And I cant believe I took her viginity 
 Virginity x 2 
 And then I just woke up 
 What a strange nightmare 
 My eyes couldnt focus 
 Was it her 
 Was it a friend or foe 
 I didnt want to know 
 But as I turned around 
 And I cant believe I took her virginity 
 Virginity

 Virgin tea

 Livin life in the fast lane no time to feel any pain 
 The way you were brought up left you so stuck up

 The liars the beggers the pushers the thieves 
 Never givewhat you really need 
 And its only now that you just find out 
 All they wanna do is make you bleed 
 Whered it all go Whats it all mean 
 Howd I end up here so far inbetween 
 Where am I going Where have I been 
 What is the circumstance Im living in 
 You drive yourself nuts trying to figure this out 
 Finding the answer to what lifes about 
 But the more that you ask the less that you see 
 Were a part of this one giant hipocracy 
 Start PRECHORUS 
 And the piper blows 
 And the audience grows 
 Fall to their knees 
 They worship greed 
 And the TV plays 
 Its Simon says 
 Can I make this clear 
 Get me the fuck out of here 
 End PRECHORUS 
 Start CHORUS 
 Stop the world I wanna get off 
 I cant take this bullshit 
 It stinks so bad its making me cough 
 This place is a fucking hell 
 Im so tired of the bullshit smell 
 Mess with me Im bound to get tough 
 Stop the world I wanna get off 
 End CHORUS 
 Everyday is like a sentence 
 A convicted crimminal doing penance 
 But for our sins theres no repentance 
 You are the sorcerers apprentice 
 The living cry for the dying 
 And yes there is no denying 
 That a referee call gonna save us all 
 Instead we find that they are lying 
 Repeat PRECHORUS 
 I wanna tell you that its gonna be fine 
 People like me say it all the time 
 But the truth is you gotta live smart 
 Stick up for yourself take it to the heart 
 Stop the world 
 Stop the worldIm alone sitting with my empty glass 
 My four walls follow me through my past 
 I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain 
 And you were waiting there swimming through apologies 
 I remember searching for the perfect words 
 I was hoping you might change your mind 
 I remember a soldier sleeping next to me 
 Riding on the metro 
 You wore white smiling as you took my hand 
 So removed we spoke of wintertime in France 
 Minutes passed with shallow words 
 Years have passed and still the hurt 
 I can see you now smiling as I pulled away 
 I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand 
 Ill love you always filled my eyes 
 I remember a night we walked along the Seine 
 I remember a feeling coming over me 
 The soldier turned then looked away 
 I remember hating you for loving me 
 Im alone sitting with my broken glass 
 And you were waiting there swimming through apologies  sorry 
 Riding on the metroSorry 
 Im not sorry 
 Sorry to let my life this way 
 Sorry to let myself decay 
 Sorry 
 Sorry to let myself decayFlaunt your will at every wheel 
 Parachute your chocolate soul 
 Cobblestones under your wheels 
 I got pictures on my mind 
 I got pictures on my mind 
 Circumvent your thick ego 
 Wooden farts theyre on the go 
 You cant tell me that Im real 
 Fear waits for us 
 When the present cant be sealed 
 Away gold dust 
 Now the dishes can be cleared 
 Till the moment is revealed 
 Then turns to rust 
 For the mighty conquered meal 
 Cant you look at my shaved ass 
 Ounce is gone and God is once 
 You cant see me suddenly 
 I got pictures on my mindSkaters de Colombia 
 venimos a rapear 
 queremos traer 
 algo original 
 un mensaje sobre 
 la verdad de la vida 
 todo esto sin ninguna mascarilla 
 Colombia vive una ola de violencia 
 debemos tratarlo con mucha paciencia 
 ya que aqui es onde vivimos y tambien nacimos 
 y donde vamos a ver crecer  todos nuestros hijos 
 Debemos pedir al todo poderoso 
 tambien ser un poco carinosos 
 para as construir una nacion 
 donde reine el sk8 y  el amor 
 Ahora entramos a la parte algo tablistica 
 eso si sin mucha logistica 
 Somos un grupo como de hermanos 
 cuando alguien cae se le tiende la mano 
 Pero quienes somos 
 Si no eres tan demente y miras fijamente 
 te podras dar de cuenta que somos 
 la diarrea candente 
 Un grupo bien formado 
 con todo y un nombre 
 lo unico que nos falta 
 es el uniforme 
 En este grupo ya hay de  todo 
 desde un tonton hasta un falton 
 ese falton soy yo ya que a veces no voy 
 y ya la cojieron conmmigo diciendome falton boy 
 Volvemos al tema de la violencia 
 ya que algunos actuan con negligencia 
 son esos del gobierno aqui la gente muerey gatillando 
 y ellos se la pasan pero paseando 
 pero menos mal el 7 de agosto 
 se le acabo el reinadito a don pastranita 
 que ya nos tenia hasta la nuquita 
 Esperamos que le vaya bien a Uribe 
 y que siempre nos diga todo bien como el pibe 
 Bueno espero que lo hayan disfutado y tambien cantado 
 recuerden el sk8 siempre presente 
 en todos estos ambientes 
 recuerdan el nombreCircumventing circuses 
 Lamenting in protest 
 To visible police 
 Presence sponsored fear 
 Battalions of riot police 
 With rubber bullet kisses 
 Baton courtesy 
 Service with a smile 
 Beyond the Staples Center you can see America 
 With its tired poor avenging disgrace 
 Peaceful loving youth against the brutality 
 Of plastic existence 
 Pushing little children 
 With their fully automatics 
 They like to push the weak around 
 A rush of words 
 Pleading to disperse 
 Upon your naked walls alive 
 A political call 
 The fall guy accord 
 We cant afford to be neutral on a moving train 
 Push them around 
 A deer dance invitation to peace 
 War staring you in the face 
 Dressed in black 
 With a helmet fierce 
 Trained and appropriate for the malcontents 
 For the disproportioned malcontents 
 The little boy smiled itll all be well 
 And say the little boy smiled itll all be well 
 Push the weak around 
 They like to push the weak aroundLa la la la la la 
 Hey man look at me rockin out 
 Im on the radio 
 Im on the video 
 With Danny and Lisa 
 They take me away from take away from 
 The strangest places strangest places 
 Sweet Danny and Lisa sweet Danny and Lisa 
 They take me away from 
 The strangest places 
 Sweet Danny and Lisa 
 La la la 
 SONG MEANING This song is about how a radio station wouldnt play SOAD on their radio station so this is just about making fun of themSo I felt like the biggest asshole

 Every day Im watching you die 
 All the thoughts I see in you about how I

 I felt like the biggest asshole 
 SONG MEANING This song is about a bunny This bunny was called Rock N Roll and Daron Malakian killed it accidentalyYou 
 Why do they always send the poor 
 Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels 
 Victorious victories kneel for brand new spankin deals 
 Marching forward hypocritic and hypnotic computers 
 You depend on our protection yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth 
 Lalalala lalalalala ooh 
 Everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Dancing in the desert blowin up the sunshine 
 Kneeling roses disappearing into Mosess dry mouth 
 Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions 
 Hangers sitting dripped in oil crying freedom 
 Handed to obsoletion still you feed us lies from the tablecloth 
 Everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine 
 Well everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Blast off its party time 
 And we dont live in a fascist nation 
 And where the fuck are you 
 Where the fuck are you 
 Why dont presidents fight the war 
 Hangars sitting dripped in oil crying freedom 
 Dancing in the desert blowin up the sun 
 Why do they always send the poor 
 They always send the poor

 And though niggas die for go on the shelf 
 Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt 
 Me I always had so I never go for self 
 Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt 
 Better slow down tellin you now put the dough down 
 Kick your door down surround the block 
 Where you go now 
 Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round

 Heres the lowdown messin with Mase gotta go down 
 What more could I say but hey guess you niggas know now

 Ice fully glowin plus Im bad to the bone 
 In the danger zone I hold my own when the pain is gone 
 Like a splinter I enter 
 So why should I throw my blows in those 
 Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles 
 My nigga BIG Imma ride for 
 But it aint too many niggas that Id die for 
 Repeat 1Edmund Kemper solved it all 
 He fooled the shrinks 
 Fooled the shrinks 
 It then appears the proclamation 
 Edmund Kemper solved it all 
 It then apears the proclamation 
 The fortress of forever 
 Been forsaken 
 Man made promise 
 Polluted with blue dye 
 Air water design 
 Can we tamper 
 We have gained 
 Outerspace outerspace 
 A million years 
 The devistation of 
 Thats not true 
 The human race the human race 
 Fortress of forever 
 Been mistaken 
 Polluting of the sky 
 Polluted with blue dyeAnd the little boy started 
 Into the eyes of the night 
 Button collects price of his time 
 Little girl glared 
 Sheets of the denial 
 The bullet connects to the price of her crime 
 What have we said 
 Wasnt it their bed 
 What of our presence 
 Havent we paid penance 
 Now the little boy sees 
 Through the eyes of delight 
 Levers erect note of his rhyme 
 Little girl bled 
 Sheets of the night 
 The lovers connect to the price of his dime 
 Havent we paid penance 
 To the old gods and moved on 
 To the new guns to the new guns 
 To the new guns to the new gunsWe fought your wars with all our hearts 
 You sent us back in body parts 
 You took our wills with the truth you stole 
 We offer prayers for your long lost soul 
 The remainder is an unjustifiable egotistical power struggle 
 At the expense of the American dream of the American dream 
 Of the American 
 We dont give a damn about your world 
 With all your global profits 
 And all your jeweled pearls 
 Right now right now 
 We dont give a fuck about your world 
 Right now right now right now right now 
 There is no flag that is large enough 
 To hide the shame of a man in cuffs 
 You switched the signs then you closed our blinds 
 You changed the channel then you changed our minds 
 No flag large enough 
 Shame on a man in cuffs 
 They closed our blinds 
 Right now right now right now right nnnnowWhat you get aint what you see 
 Things that dont come easily 
 Feelin happy in my pain 
 Icicles within my brain 
 Cocaine 
 Somethin blowin in my head 
 Winds of ice that soon will spread 
 Death would freeze my very soul 
 Makes me happy makes me cold 
 My eyes are blind but I can see 
 The snowflakes glisten on the trees 
 The sun no longer sets me free 
 I feel the snowflakes freezing me 
 Let the winter sun shine on 
 Let me feel the frost of dawn 
 Fill my dreams with flakes of snow 
 Soon Ill feel the chilling glow 
 Dont you think I know what Im doing 
 Dont tell me that its doing me wrong 
 Youre the one thats really a loser 
 This is where I feel I belong 
 Crystal world with winter flowers 
 Turns my days to frozen hours 
 Lying snowblind in the sun 
 Will my Ice Age ever comeThe kombucha mushroom people 
 Sitting around all day 
 Who could believe you 
 Let your mother pray 
 Sugar 
 Im not there all the time you know 
 Some people some people some people 
 Call it insane 
 Yeah they call it insane Sugar 
 I play Russian roulette every day a mans sport 
 With a bullet called life 
 Yeah mama called life Sugar 
 You know that every time I try to go 
 Where I really want to be 
 Its already where I am 
 Cause Im already there 
 The kombucha mushroom people 
 I got a gun the other day from Sako 
 Its cute small fits right in my pocket 
 Yeah right in my pocket Sugar 
 My girl you know she lashes out at me sometimes 
 And I just fucking kick her in the 
 Ooh baby shes ookay Sugar 
 People are always chasing me down 
 Trying to push my face to the ground 
 Where all they really want to do 
 Is suck out my motherfucking brains 
 Let your mother pray 
 I sit in my desolate room 
 No lights 
 No music 
 Just anger 
 I killed everyone 
 Im gone away forever 
 But Im feeling better 
 How do I feel what do I say 
 Fuck you it all goes away 
 In the end it all goes away 
 In the end it all goes awayStretching filing against her skin 
 Blessed are those who are not kin 
 In sin we breathe in sex we tie 
 Duct tape her legs to the red sky 
 Foolsome flesh allowances 
 The pansies raided the pantry of 
 Gathering dreams promiscuous 
 Delight deny not the flavor 
 Custard dreams 
 Abusing using 
 Marmalade flesh 
 Naked spread am I am I 
 Actors of the tragic phantom 
 Extend your legs for great Saturn 
 Brown table tops scream for cover 
 At the sight of your new lover 
 If today I die and cant deny 
 The poison chosen for tonight 
 Tonight 
 Borrowed dreams hollowed reveries 
 Metal pillows pewter yellows 
 Furry roadkill house on the hill 
 Pouring gravy on her thighs still 
 TonightAnd the little boy stared 
 Into the eyes of the night 
 Button collects price of his time 
 Little girl glared 
 Sheets of denial 
 Bullet connects to the price of her crime 
 What have we said 
 Wasnt it their bed 
 What of presence 
 Havent we paid penance 
 To the new guns 
 Now the little boy sees 
 Through the eyes of delight 
 Levers erect note of his rhyme 
 Little girl bled 
 Sheets of the night 
 Lovers connect to the price of his dime 
 To the new guns to the new guns

 To the old gods and moved on 
 To the old gods and moved on

 SONG MEANING Its an allegorical reference to wider political corruption etc implying the government sells the American military and funds etc to the highest bidder and equally violates those its able to exploit America is referred to the she in the songThe phoenix he helped create 
 Out of control boy without a dad 
 Shot the gun that startled my life 
 While I drove him with a fortyfive 
 Friends for years images in red 
 Blew off his own motherfucking head 
 Confidence dreams insecurity 
 Men fall unrealized 
 Unrealized unrealized 
 Making a decision of death 
 While everyone around you plead 
 Now you fly in peace 
 I hope my friend 
 A man cant avoid what hes meant to do 
 When hes meant to do it 
 Even if he doesnt really want to 
 My memories are of fun and friendship 
 Of weakness within the strength of youth 
 For reasons undefined reasons undefined 
 Reasons undefined reasons undefined 
 Your men fall unrealized 
 Dont you realize that evil 
 Lives in a motherfucking skin 
 Lives in the skin 
 Why the fuck did you take him away from us 
 You motherfuckerI dont know why she called 
 Of telling me about her 
 She told me she was the one 
 And that everything was done 
 And then I looked around and 
 When I fucked her 
 Right beneath the tree 
 And I cant believe that I took her virginity 
 2x 
 Who was it there 
 Was it a friend or a foe 
 I didnt wanna know 
 4x 
 Who was it thereWelcome to the soldier side 
 Where theres no one here but me 
 People all grow up to die 
 There is no one here but me oohLife is but a dream 
 Drifting on a stream a stream 
 Consciously it seems 
 All of what remains 
 Ego brain 
 Manmade shame 
 Shame 
 Love after it rains 
 You see my pain is real 
 Watch my world dissolve 
 And pretend that none of us see the fall 
 As I turn to sand 
 You took me by the hand 
 And declared that love prevails over all 
 I am just a man 
 Fighting other men 
 For land for land 
 While I turn to sand 
 In spite of the pain 
 Shame love after it rains 
 Love after it rains

 One that smiled when he flew over the bay 
 Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot 
 My horse 
 Is a shackled old man 
 His his remorse 
 Was that he couldnt survey 
 The skies right before 
 Right before they went gray 
 My horse and my remorse 
 Flying over a great bay 
 My source 
 Is the source of all creation 
 Her discourse 
 Is that we all dont survey 
 Right before they go gray 
 My source and my remorse 
 Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot 
 One that smiled when he flew over the baySuch a lonely day and its mine 
 The most loneliest day of my life 
 Such a lonely day should be banned 
 Its a day that I cant stand 
 Such a lonely day shouldnt exist 
 Its a day that Ill never miss 
 Such a lonely day and its mine 
 And if you go I want to go with you 
 And if you die I want to die with you 
 Take your hand and walk away 
 Its a day that Im glad I survivedTelevision in disgrace 
 When you get home its a race

 Will you live at your own pace 
 Life so unnecessary 
 Television in disgrace

 Will you live at your own paceIm afraid of heights go push me off a cliff 
 Im afraid of heights so push me off a cliff 
 Im afraid of heights now push me off a cliff 
 Im afraid of heights dont push me off a cliff 
 A very high cliff 
 Treetops in the sky 
 Shut up or die 
 Dont tell them youre afraid of heights 
 Consciously you lie 
 Dont tell them that you cannot fly 
 Im afraid of heights go push me off a cliff 
 Im sure you dont want to know 
 So shut up 
 So fuck off 
 Shut up 
 Fuck offPut your roulette everywhere 
 Parachute your chakram soul 
 Help em strong and do your best 
 I got pictures on my mind 
 Circumvent your dinkydong 
 One and thrice theyre on the go 
 You cant tell me that Im well 
 Fair ways for us 
 When the present can be sealed 
 Away gold dust 
 For the mighty conquered meal 
 Cant you look at my shaved ass 
 Duece is God and got his lungs 
 You can see me Saturday 
 I got pictures on my mindDead men lying on the bottom of the grave 
 Wondering when savior comes is he gonna be saved 
 Maybe youre a sinner into your alternate life 
 Maybe youre a joker maybe you deserve to die 
 They were crying when their sons left 
 God is wearing black 
 Hes gone so far to find no hope 
 Hes never coming back 
 All young men must go 
 Hes come so far to find the truth 
 Hes never going home 
 Young men standing on the top of their own graves 
 Wondering when Jesus comes are they gonna be saved 
 Cruelty to the winner bishop tells the king his lies 
 Maybe youre a mourner maybe you deserve to die 
 Hes come so far to find no truth 
 Welcome to the soldier side 
 There is no one here but me 
 People on the soldier side 
 There is no one here but meSuperstition taking all of us for a ride 
 Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right 
 The bombs are falling overhead with no sight 
 While you are talking all detached so tell us 
 Where youre going to the bottom 
 Do you hear us We are rotting 
 Were going down in a spiral to the ground 
 No one no ones gonna save us now 
 Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide 
 The masked comforts to delusionals theyre all in fright 
 The true believers head was bathed in sunlight 
 While you are walking all detached so tell us 
 Not even God 
 No one saved us no ones gonna save us 
 Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall 
 Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall 
 Superstition taking all of us for a ride 
 The bombs are falling over our head with no sight 
 While you are talking all detached detached detached detached detached 
 No one no ones gonna save us now 
 No one saved us no one saved us 
 No one saved us no ones gonna save us now 
 SONG MEANING This song is about the point of view of a person we are at war against probably in Iraq but could be other wars Its about the US coming in and bombing them and destroying their homes and how the people there cant do much about itPrepare yourself for death 
 Your life is under a trick 
 In the end its obvious that 
 Its all just an acronym

 Your life is an acronym 
 You hide from life you hide from life 
 Well its all just an acronym 
 I dont know why your talking to me 
 Why why why 
 Fuck you in your flake 
 Flake 
 FlakeDamn you 
 Stay away from me 
 I got a disease 
 Everyone is sleeping 
 Fuck you 
 For putting hate in me 
 For putting faith in me 
 Everyone is sleepingAll that I want all that I need 
 I dont want to camp 
 Dont want to bleed 
 Fight your enemy 
 Change his soul 
 Turn it to be free X2 
 All that I want all that I need 
 I am here in the balcony 
 EndEnd of the world 
 Do you even care 
 And they take it all away 
 Away away away 
 Fall before the girl 
 Do you even want her 
 Are you blind 
 If you werent you were always blind 
 You shake the world with everlasting times 
 Making everyone and every little thing your damn whore 
 Then the end become chaos 
 You shake the world with everlasting timesI need not fear the love 
 You love to love the fear 
 I never want to be alone 
 Ive forgotten too 
 The road keeps moving the clouds 
 The clouds become unreal 
 I guess Ill always be at home 
 Do you want me to try 
 Directing your night 
 An exit lights the sky 
 The sky becomes complete 
 Traveling hearts divine the throne 
 Friction lines bumps 
 The highway song complete 
 The signs are all turning right 
 Want me to try 
 The furious forms of life 
 Our days are never coming back 
 The cannons of our time 
 Our days are never coming backPushing the law again 
 Pushing the law again 
 Justice with a sword 
 Our smiling knight on board 
 Opening his heart to everyone 
 And loving without a doubt 
 Embracing friends and 
 Embarrasing foes 
 And those who are unjust 
 A man true to his heart 
 Without fear or misgivings 
 With insecurity tattooed across his body 
 The first to accept the last to dissapoint 
 He understood all and expected nothing 
 Now you are free 
 Free to roam in the skies 
 Now and then visit me 
 With your starlit eyes 
 NOW 
 You took all our hearts 
 With your smile 
 And left a legacy untold 
 You conquered life and fear 
 So you see there was no room for you to grow old 
 Pushing the law againThe unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for them selves 
 About beta carotine and theta waves 
 Then the senses wanted the sky 
 Is there life looking for you 
 Is there life in waiting for you 
 Waiting for you 
 The National debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for them selves 
 Then the people found out the lie 
 Is there life in looking for you 
 Waiting for you 
 Waiting for youPeters pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper

 I have to find you I have to meet you 
 Signs of your face slowing your pace 
 I need your guidance I need to seek my 
 Innervision innervision 
 My pupils dance lost in a trance 
 Your sacred silence losing all violence 
 Stars in their place mirror your face 
 I need to find you I need to seek my 
 Innervision innervision innervision

 Innervision The road that leads to all 
 Innervision 
 Your sacred silence losing all violenceDr Jekyll in lower case 
 Mr Hyde caps 
 Lost in the darkness 
 Silence surrounds you 
 Once there was morning 
 Now endless night 
 I will find the answer 
 Ill never desert you 
 I promise you this 
 Till the day that I 
 Do you really think 
 That I would ever let you go 
 Do you think id ever set you free 
 If you do Im sad to say 
 It simply isnt so 
 You will never get away from me 
 All that you are is a face in the mirror 
 I close my eyes and you disappear 
 Im what you face when you face in the mirror 
 Long as you live I will still be here 
 All that you are is an end of a nightmare 
 All that you are is a dying scream 
 After tonight I shall end this demon dream 
 This is not a dream my friend 
 And it will never end 
 This one is the nightmare that goes on 
 Hyde is here to stay 
 No matter what you may pretend 
 And hell flourish long after youre gone 
 Soon you will die and my silence will hide you 
 You cannot choose and youll lose control 
 You cant control me 
 I live deep inside you 
 Each day you feel me devour your soul 
 I dont need you to survive like you need me 
 I become whole as you dance with Death 
 And I will rejoice as you breathe your final breath 
 For I live inside you forever 
 With Satan himself by my side 
 And now know that now and forever 
 Youll never be able to separate 
 Jekyll from hyde 
 Cant you see 
 Its over now 
 Its time to die 
 No not i 
 Only you 
 If I die 
 You die to 
 Youll die in me 
 Ill be you 
 Damn you Hyde 
 Set me free 
 You are me 
 No deep inside 
 I am you 
 You are hyde 
 No never 
 Yes foreverBreathing each others lives 
 Holding this in mind 
 That if we fall we all fall 
 And we fall alone 
 The cold insincerity of steel machines 
 Have consumed our euphoria 
 Transforming us into muted dreams 
 Dreaming of the day that 
 We attack 
 Attack attack your fetal servitude 
 Attack attack attack with pesticide 
 All the years of propaganda 
 We shall attack 
 Books illustrate what we already know 
 Candles cry towards the sky 
 Racing your flags along polluted coast 
 Attack 
 Attack 
 Breathing each others lives 
 Whats the philosophy of displaced minds 
 The bombing of all homes and villages 
 Truth is the only sword bleeding minds 
 Bleeding till the day that 
 We shall attack 
 Attack all the homes and villages 
 Attack all the schools and hospitals 
 You attack all the rapes and pillages 
 We shall attackPoisoning a drink 
 Bleeding in a sink 
 Choking with a link 
 Killing with a stink 
 Just your mothers 
 Ho 
 Poisoning a drink 
 Burning up 
 My sweet Clementine 
 Trampling a shrink 
 Hallelujah wink 
 Getting on the brink 
 Murdering a shrink 
 All my sweet revenge 
 Will be yours for the taking 
 Its in the making baby 
 My sweet revenge 
 I saw her laugh 
 Then she said Go away 
 Then she said then she said 
 Go away away 
 Will be yours its in the making 
 Its in the taking making baking taking faking 
 Ho my sweet Clementine 
 Shoulda been coulda been 
 Woulda been woulda been you 
 Woulda been woulda been youYoure a grand ole flag youre a high flying flag 
 And forever in peace may you wave 
 Youre the emblem of 
 The land I love 
 The home of the free and the brave 
 Evry Heart beats true for the red white and blue 
 Where there is never a boast or brag 
 Should all aquitance be forgot 
 Keep your eye on the Grand Ole FlagLife is a story 
 Go ahead and find your sight 
 Life is your glory 
 Go ahead and live the night 
 But to live means to be here 
 In the present now 
 Do you try to bow for the gift of your day 
 Then you cede to the morning sun 
 Pretending that we live doesnt make us alive 
 Life is a story 
 Pretending that we see doesnt give us the sight 
 What is it that makes us lose sight 
 True sight of what is real and essential 
 Ill take organised patterns of chaos 
 Over the chaotic organisations of man any day 
 The patterns in the carpet do add up though 
 You dont have to count 
 You dont have to countWatching from a post up high 
 From where you see the ships afar 
 From a welltrained eye 
 The waves all keep on crashing by 
 If you are the light post 
 Then you own the working class 
 But if you want the answers 
 You better give a piece of ass 
 Give a piece of your ass 
 Warning post hypnotic suggestions 
 Running the ships ashore 
 The orange light that follows 
 Will soon proclaim itself a god 
 If you point your questions 
 The fog will surely chew you up 
 You better get ready for the fire 
 Get ready for the fire 
 The ships are multiplying day after day sir 
 And theyre coming close to the shore sir shore sir 
 We need to evacuate the light post 
 Its all over its all over 
 Its all over 
 SONG MEANING Serj Tankian the lead singer says this song is about posthypnotic suggestion being used in the assassination of President Kennedy Go figurePreflight delight 
 Defaced street lights 
 A pyramid mind fuck 
 Dont leave your seats now 
 Popcorn everywhere canned 
 Cliche people organs rare 
 Corn everywhere canned 
 Rare repeat 
 I want to be 
 A fallen ruby 
 Guest vibrations 
 Humans everywhere canned 
 Cliche people cannot dare 
 Dare repeat 
 Cliche people cannot dare dare dare dare 
 SONG MEANING This song is about how culture is becoming dumber and dumber with lamer and lamer clichesIm wishin and wishin away at you God 
 Im wishin and wishin away at you God 
 I dont see nothing but pain and misery cause 
 You are the one for me why cant it all be true 
 Can I escape with my blue fallen revery 
 Why cant it all be true why cant it all be true 
 Suddenly I believe you are the one for me 
 Graciously you move through my closed heart artery 
 Ive been wishin away at you 
 Ive been wishin away at you God 
 Wishin and wishin away at you God 
 At you God at you God at you GodFor today we will take the body parts 
 And put them on the wall 
 For treated indigenously digenously 
 Human right is private blue chip pry 
 Were the prophetic generation of bottled water bottled water 
 Causing poor populations to die to die to die 
 For treated indigenously digenously 
 Human right is private blue chip pry 
 You you went beyond and you lost it all 
 Why did you go there 
 From beyond you saw it all 
 Why did you 
 We lost consumer confidence in casual karma casual karma 
 Confetti camouflage camouflage the flage the flage 
 She lost her mind 
 Someone kicked her into the back of the line 
 She lost her head 
 When they called and they said that they thought he was dead 
 Dreaming of screaming 
 Someone kick me out of my mind 
 I hate these thoughts I cant deny 
 I hate these thoughts I cant de 
 Why did you 
 I hate these thoughts I cant deny 
 You will take the body parts and put them up on the wall 
 And bring the dark disaster 
 SONG MEANING Its about how people are self serving and how they dont see the bigger picture of the less fortunatePlagiarized existence exist 
 Among the writers of the word 
 Shake your spear at Shakespeare 
 Loud and noisy 
 Strong refrigerators 
 Gaining independence 
 Stupid people do stupid things 
 Smart people outsmart each other 
 Then themselves then themselves 
 Take me down there 
 Photographic relapse 
 People feeding frenzy 
 The devil is so lovely 
 So lovely 
 My blue moon rivets in exits 
 Forewarned customary spirits 
 By myself by myself 
 SONG MEANING This song is about dealing with corrupt companiesIm but a little bit bit bit show 
 Just the back 
 We all need to fuck the system 
 SONG MEANING This song is kind of self explanatoryTell the people 
 Tell the people that arrive 
 Tell the people 
 We dont need to multiply 
 Die 
 Show your people 
 Show your people how we died 
 We dont need to nullify 
 No need to nullify 
 We dont need to 
 Ask your people 
 Ask your people what is right 
 No need to multiply 
 We dont need to multiplyMisshapen Crown 
 Life in a bubble Jungle 
 It showed another jungle 
 Staying in the crown 
 Seeing you believing the satiric with the power struggle 
 Believing then dealing appeasing the power struggle 
 Were left with no arms right in the power struggle 
 But showed another jungle 
 Left with arms In the power struggle 
  
 Foreign chant 
 Life is but a big bulge 
 Left with arms right here In the power struggleHey Mr Jack 
 Is that the mouth wash in your eyes 
 Hey Mr Jack 
 Is that the cause of your surprise 
 Hey where you at 
 On the side of the freeway in the car 
 In the car 
 On the side of the freeway in the 
 Is that the trick of your disguise 
 Is that the cause of your demise 
 Wake up 
 Seven am morning came to take us away 
 Little men big guns pointing at our heads 
 Little men big guns pointing at our heads 
 At our at our heads 
 Your prospect of living gone 
 You ran the light at dawn 
 Protectors on your back 
 Lights are on their track 
 You must now face authority 
 Youre nothing like me 
 Put your hands up get out of the car 
 Fuck you pig 
 SONG MEANING Mr Jack is an alcoholic pulled over for driving under the influence Its not actually antiauthority as commonly believedConquest to the lover 
 And your love to the fire 
 Permanence unfolding in the absolute 
 Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice 
 Eloquence belongs to the conqueror 
 The pictures of time and space are rearranged 
 In this little piece of typical tragedy 
 Justified candy 
 Brandy for the nerves 
 You and me 
 Well all go down in history 
 With a sad Statue of Liberty 
 And a generation that didnt agree 
 I forgot to 
 I forgot to let you know that 
 Conquest to the lover 
 Generation 
 What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering 
 Suffering suffering now 
 Belonging 
 Belonging toNow we want peace without patriot missiles 
 Blown to bits are civilian targets 
 Parade Laugh Rejoice Sing 
 We are the victors of nothing 
 Spend more money on a war 
 Your people starved and turn to whores 
 Slaves of the chosen ones paying millions for each bomb 
 Country without a race 
 Formed from people you disgrace 
 White right conservative might 
 Killers of Kennedy with no fright 
 The American way 
 Freedom cried the marching man 
 Flags ripped out of their black hands 
 Beaten Slain Tortured Killed 
 Their only mistake was being born here 
 Invade countries just for oil 
 Send your troops all down to boil 
 Iraq Grenada Nam and Chile 
 Truman doctrine our own way 
 The government here can suck my balls 
 Policing the world in overalls 
 Armed rebellion minority 
 Disrespected race colored mind 
 Crazed loonies all walk the streets 
 Missing children on milk cartons 
 Mother selling child for crack 
 Mr President check your back 
 The American wayTheres nothing wrong with me 
 Theres something wrong with you 
 Theres something wrong with me 
 I hope your stepson doesnt eat the fish 
 When were crying for our next fix 
 Theres nothing wrong with me 
 Killers never hurt feelings 
 Gonorrhea Gorgonzola 
 Single files of clean feedings 
 I cant see your soul soul through your eyes 
 The crying walls of sliding architecture 
 Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture 
 Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells 
 Wrong with you and I 
 Dont eat the fish 
 SONG MEANING This song is basically about Americas rising obsession with drugsShes like heroin 
 Sipping through a little glass 
 Im looking for some help 
 I need someone to save her ass 
 Chinese tricks in rooms 
 With ghosts of hooker girlie dudes 
 Me and heroin 
 Maybe we can make some cash selling 
 Ass 
 Selling ass for heroin 
 She wants nothing more 
 But to be a little whore 
 He wants nothing less 
 But to wear a little dress 
 Shes like heroin 
 I need someone to make some cash selling 
 Maybe we can make some cash 
 I need someone to save my assWhat if theres no more poor to help 
 Another God is what I am 
 What if I have forgotten how 
 Come out houses and get out now 
 Get out right now 
 Theres something shook up in me 
 Theres something I dont wanna see 
 But is it growin in me CLUE 
 It is the hardest thing to do 
 You watch it grow on top of you 
 I see youre just like everyone NEVER 
 But it it growin in me 
 I dont speak that language any more 
 My blood is not that color any more 
 My blood is not that same way any more 
 I cannot deny it any more UGH 
 But is it growin in me 
 ThanksWhats my problem Heres my problem 
 My problem is that Im too visual to be blind 
 Too audiological to be deaf 
 Too ideological to be in peace 
 Too compassionate to be in war 
 Too crazy to be sane 
 Too sane to be lazy 
 Too emotional to be you 
 If I could only stop my head from going into constant infection 
 Then maybe I could swim back to my own version of consistent sanity 
 Angelic demons liquid dreams transparent mountains of our own reality 
 Burning oceans melting faces melting faces why 
 Then maybe I could swim back into my own version of consistent sanity 
 Lying pictures screaming metal in my control 
 Amnesia hysteria insomnia constant canutations until youre in the hospital and youre 
 Fucking DEAD 
 LYING PICTURES SCREAMING METAL In my control 
 Baby my minds got it all in control 
 Maybe Im not in controlEverybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody fucks 
 Everybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody sucks 
 Everybody everybody everybody cries 
 Everybody everybody everybody dies

 And we light up the sky 
 Mind illusions acquainted 
 Bubbles erotica 
 Bicycle shoestrings 
 One flag 
 Flag number one 
 Painting the paintings of the alive 
 And we light up the skyDark is the light 
 The man you fight 
 With all your prayers incantations 
 Running away a trivial day 
 Of judgment and deliverance 
 To whom was sold this bounty soul 
 A gentile or a priest 
 Who victored over the Seljuks 
 When the Holy Land was taken 
 We will fight the heathens we will fight the heathens 
 Was it the riches of the land 
 Powers of bright darkness 
 That lead the noble to the East 
 To fight the heathens 
 We must call upon our bright darkness 
 Beliefs theyre the bullets of the wicked 
 One was written on the sword 
 For you must enter a room to destroy it destroy it destroy it 
 Now international security 
 The call of the righteous man 
 Needs a reason to kill man 
 History teaches us so 
 The reason he must attain 
 Must be approved by his God 
 His child partisan brother of war 
 Of war we dont speak anymore 
 We will fight the heathens we will fight the heathensI fuck yo ass up

 People all grow up to die 
 There is no one here but meIm alone sitting with my broken glass 
 I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain 
 And you waiting there swimming through apologies 
 I remember the soldier standing next to me 
 I went smiling as you took my hand 
 So removed we spoke in France 
 You were passed as shallow word 
 It isnt passed theres still a hurt 
 I can see you now smiling as I pulled away 
 Sorry 
 Ill love you always filled my eyes 
 I remember the night we walked along the Seine 
 The soldier turned then walked away 
 Fuck you for loving me 
 Riding on the metroAh ahah ah ahahah 
 Ah ahah ah ahahah 
 Can you feel their haunting presence 
 Liar killer demon 
 Back to the 
 River Aras 
 Someones blank stare deemed it warfare 
 Back to the River Aras 
 Freedom 
 Were free 
 Can you hear the Holy Mountains 
 Someones mouth said Paint them all red 
 Free 
 They have all returned resting on the mountain side 
 We have learned that you have no 
 They have returned resting on the mountain side 
 Honor murderer sodomizer 
 They have returned resting on the mountain side 
 Ah ahah ah ahahahYeah all right 
 Yeah all right 
 Two skies 
 Watching it all fading 
 Living it all fading 
 Two skies fading 
 Ones abating 
 Two sons 
 Living it all dying 
 Two sons fighting 
 Ones abiding 
 Watching them both fighting 
 Seeing them both dying 
 Crack pipes needles PCP and fast cars 
 Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star 
 If I feel like talking I never be wrong 
 If I feel like walking you best come along 
 I close my windows crank the heat up high 
 Til my palms are wet and my tongue is dry 
 Im looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die 
 Im a midnight fistfight 
 Looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Alright 
 Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die alright 
 Two sons fighting ones abiding 
 Two skies fading ones abating 
 Cause Im looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Im a stupid motherfucker if I die I die 
 Two skies two sons watching them all go 
 Yeah all rightKaleidoscope of love 
 Ophidians dance as the shifting occurs 
 We are stars and electric animals 
 Nurtured by the mothers of prostitutes 
 Floating in a Mushroom Universe 
 Swimming in a sea of Cyclostomes 
 And as we surface into the Tide 
 You open up and I come inside 
 I must be in Limbo 
 Cause Purgatorys always 
 Felt just like home 
 And as the world spins round and round 
 We fornicate upon the cotton clouds 
 That rain down sulfur smiles 
 Upon the children at play 
 In the poppy fields 
 Sinking for what seems like Forever 
 Like Atlantis into the Sea 
 To forget the shore and wash away 
 Wash away my memory 
 Inside the moon 
 Lives the High Priest 
 Of the Mushroom Cult 
 Upon the Altar 
 Are the ashes 
 Of the Pharisees 
 Ive sold my soul 
 Sold my soul 
 Soul my soul away 
 Im free of guilt 
 Free of sin 
 Free of everything 
 Free of everythingJump 
 Bounce 
 Down 
 Up 
 Jump 
 Pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo 
 Pogo pogo pogo 
 Pogo 
 I went out on a date 
 With a girl a bit late 
 She had so many friends 
 Gliding through many hands 
 I brought my pogo stick 
 Just to show her a trick 
 Unannounced Twister games 
 All players with no names 
 They lined up double quick 
 But just one pogo stick 
 Everyone gets to play 
 Runaway exposé 
 It was so exotic 
 Oh I like to spread you out 
 Touching whoevers behind 
 DownAint no more sunshine just rain and cold suffering 
 Generation born to die with their eyes wide open 
 The clock strikes 
 The wrong rights 
 The mob rules 
 The second Armageddon igniting the lit fuse 
 No turning back and every soldier is on point 
 Ready to die the confrontation coming ready of not Its on again 
 Its time to say your prayers again 
 Its not the end just the beginning of the end 
 Is it hard 
 Yeah I can hold it down like that Is it real 
 Yeah You know I break it down like that 
 Is it rough 
 Dont even try to front like that 
 Im on fire baby a big dog will hunt like that 
 Another day another buster wanna battle me 
 Another mamma crying now her baby is a casualty 
 Im ready nigga slice like a machete nigga 
 Got fetty nigga never spend it on Betty nigga 
 I hit and run never stressing to look back 
 When I look back I think about the love I never had 
 Then I wake up I get fucked up and I get even 
 Approach you from the front 
 While in your back a knife 
 Im leaving 
 The sky is falling I dont care 
 I just want to feel good 
 Her trains leaving she dont care 
 She just wants to feel good 
 The World is dying we dont care 
 We just want to feel good 
 Its all over we dont care 
 No we cant compromise like that 
 No we cant conform like that 
 Im saying fuck you and fuck the norm like that 
 Revolt and transform like that 
 Make a difference 
 Have an impact 
 It wont stop raining its flooding Revelation was all true 
 You drew first blood Jesus is coming to take you 
 Coming to break you make you just like new 
 Satan laughing spreads his wings and gets a new tattoo 
 A new platinum chain a new pinky ring the rolex the benz 
 The huggy bear pimp thing 
 Nigga its midnight never forget where you come from 
 Keep your mouth shut Back the fuck up 
 Watch what you doingSuch a lonely day and its mine 
 Such a lonely day should be banned 
 The most lonely day of my life 
 Such a lonely day shouldnt exist 
 Such a lonely day and its mine 
 Its a day that Im glad I survived 
  
 Added by Mike DiehlI cannot disguise 
 All the stomach pains and the walking of the canes 
 When you do come out 
 And you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy 
 But I cannot grow 
 Til you eat the last of me oh when will I be free 
 And you a parasite 
 Just find another host just another fool to roast 
 Cause you 
 My tapeworm tells me what to do 
 You 
 My tapeworm tells me where to go 
 Pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey 
 I cannot deny 
 All the evil traits and the filling of the crates 
 And you slither up to me in your pimping majesty 
 Till you eat the last of me oh when will I be free 
 Just find another host just another stool to post 
 Pull the tapeworm out of me 
 Im sitting in my room with a needle in my hand 
 Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man 
 Sitting in my room with a needle in my hand

 SONG MEANING This song is basically saying how mankind isnt human anymoreIll wait here 
 Youre crazy 
 Those vicious streets are filled with strays 
 You shouldve never gone to Hollywood 
 They find you 
 Twotime you 
 Say youre the best theyve ever seen 
 You shouldve never trusted Hollywood 
 I wrote you 
 And told you 
 You were the biggest fish out here 
 They take you 
 And make you 
 They look at you in disgusting ways 
 I was standing on the wall 
 Feeling ten feet tall 
 All you maggots 
 Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard 
 This is my front page 
 This is my new age 
 All you bitches put your hands in the air 
 And wave them like you just dont care 
 Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard 
 Phony people come to pray 
 Look at all of them beg to stay 
 The lines in the letter said 
 We have gone to Hackensack 
 Smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard 
 You shouldve never trusted HollywoodSweet berries ready for two 
 Ghosts are no different than you 
 Ghosts are now waiting for you 
 Are you 
 Sweet berries ready for two 
 Are you dreaming 
 Dreaming the night 
 Dreaming all right 
 Do we do we know 
 When we fly 
 When we when we go 
 Do we die 
 Are you dreaming 
 Do we dieTheyre trying to build a prison 
 Theyre trying to build a prison 
 Following the rights movements you clamped on with your iron fists 
 Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids 
 I buy my crack my smack my bitch 
 Right here in Hollywood 
 Nearly 2 million Americans are incarcerated 
 In the prison system prison system of the US 
 Theyre trying to build a prison 
 For you and me to live in 
 Another prison system 
 For you and me 
 Minor drug offenders fill your prisons you dont even flinch 
 All our taxes paying for your wars against the new nonrich 
 The percentage of Americans in the prison system prison system 
 Has doubled since 1985 
 For you and I 
 For you and me 
 Oh baby you and me 
 All research and successful drug policies show that treatment should be increased 
 And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences 
 Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world 
 Drugs are now your global policy now you police the globe 
 Drug money is used to rig elections 
 And train brutal corporatesponsored dictators around the world 
 Oh baby you and meElimination Elimination Elimination 
 Die

 Walk Down 
 A whole race genocide 
 Taking away all of our pride 
 Taken away 
 Watch it all fall down 
 Dont speak Dont hear

 100 thousand dying on your TV screen 
 Nothing real to fear 
 The sick man of Europe finishing his meal 
 Recognition Restoration Reparation 
 Watch it all fall 
 Revolution the only solution 
 The armed response of an entire nation 
 Weve taken all your shit 
 Now its time for restitution 
 The plan was mastered and called genocide 
 Never want to see you around 
 Took all the children and the we died 
 The few that remained were never found 
 All in a system

 Walk down 
 They tried to terminate us 
 Knowing no one would fuss 
 Its time to take it over 
 Its time for the attack 
 All in a System of a Down down

 Fuck you like a dog 
 Well I see you barking like a dog 
 Well I see you barking like a dogCursed Earth cursed Earth cursed Earth cursed Earth 
 Ill never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart 
 All because we all live in the valley of the walls 
 When they speak we can peek from the windows of their mouths 
 To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun 
 You never think you know why know 
 Ever think you know why know 
 Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings 
 Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything 
 The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead 
 But nows a bird able to fly able to die able to fuck your brothers earth 
 On the other side on the other side the other side 
 Do you ever try to fly do you ever try to fly 
 Have you ever wanted to die have you ever wanted to die 
 Dont ever try to fly dont ever try to fly 
 Dont ever try to fly unless you leave your body on the other side 
 Never try to die you ever try to die 
 Ever think you know why knowThe piercing radiant moon  
 The piercing radiant moon 
 The storming of poor June  
 Storming of poor June 
 All the life running through her hair  
 Through her hair 
 Approaching guiding light  
 Approaching guiding light 
 Our shallow years in fright  
 Our shallow years in fright 
 Dreams are made winding  
 Dreams are made winding 
 Through my head  
 Through my head 
 Before you know awake 
 Your lives are open wide 
 The Vchip gives them sight 
 Of all the life running through her hair 
 The spiders all in tune 
 The evening of the moon 
 Before you know 
 Before you know I will be waiting all awake 
 Dreams are made winding through her hair 
 Dreams are made winding through her hairMaking two possibilities a reality 
 Predicting the future of things we all know 
 Fighting off the diseased programming 
 Of centuries centuries centuries centuries 
 Science fails to recognize the single most 
 Potent element of human existence 
 Letting the reins go to the unfolding 
 Is faith faith faith faith 
 Science has failed our world 
 Science has failed our Mother Earth 
 Spirit moves through all things 
 Science has failed our Mother EarthIve been walking through your streets 
 Where all your moneys earned 
 Where all your buildings crying 
 And clueless neckties working 
 Revolving fake lawn houses 
 Housing all your fears 
 Desensitized by TV 
 Overbearing advertising 
 God of consumerism 
 And all your crooked pictures looking good 
 Mirrorism 
 Filtering information for the public eye 
 Designed for profiteering 
 Your neighbor what a guy 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Every time you drop the bomb 
 You kill the god your child has borne 
 Modern globalization 
 Coupled with condemnations 
 Unnecessary death 
 Matador corporations 
 Puppeting your frustrations 
 With a blinded flag 
 Manufacturing consent 
 Is the name of the game 
 The bottom line is money 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 Four thousand hungry children leave us per hour from starvation 
 While billions are spent on bombs 
 Creating death showers 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Why must we kill our own kind 
 You kill the god your child has born 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Every time you drop the boomI had an out of body experience 
 The other day 
 Her name was Jesus 
 And for her everyone cried 
 Everyone cried 
 Everyone cried 
 Try her philosophy 
 Try 
 You die for her philosophy 
 Die for her philosophy 
 Die her philosophy 
 Die 
 Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture 
 Led me thy blades 
 Were crossed and terrored ravages of architecture 
 Hoist around the spade 
 Die 
 Why 
 Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go through our souls 
 Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go all through our souls 
 Die 
 Like a mother fucker 
 Why 
 Like a mother fucker like a mother fucker 
 I want to fuck my way to the garden 
 Cause everyone needs a mother fucker 
 The following of a Christ 
 The falling of Christ 
 The falling of ChristYou get a shiver in the park 
 Its raining in the dark but meantime 
 South of the river you stop and you hold everything 
 A band is blowing Dixie double four time 
 You feel alright when you hear that music ring 
 Now you step inside you dont see too many faces 
 Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down 
 Competition from other places 
 But the horns be blowing that sound 
 Well on downsouth well on downsouth London town 
 We are the System 
 We are the System Of A DownConversion software version 70 
 Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub 
 Eating seeds as a pastime activity 
 The toxicity of our city of our city 
 New what do you own the world 
 How do you own disorder disorder 
 Now somewhere between the sacred silence 
 Sacred silence and sleep 
 Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep 
 Disorder disorder disorder 
 Hmm hmm 
 More wood for their fires loud neighbors 
 Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck 
 New what do you own the world 
 How do you own disorder 
 Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep 
 When I became the sun 
 I shone life into the mans hearts 
 I shone life into the mans heartsEveryday is nothing but stress to me 
 Constantly dwellin on how you got the best of me 
 Wanna know somethin 
 I cant believe the way you keep testin me 
 And mentally molestin me 
 But would you think any less of me 
 If I said that Id be there 
 Would you think any less of me 
 If I said I really cared 
 Of course you would 
 Cause you 
 Only want what you cant have 
 As for me 
 Im stuck with my dick in my hand 
 Because you dont feel nothing at all 
 You dont feel nothing at all 
 Maybe theres more to life then it seems 
 Im constantly runnin from reality chasin dreams 
 Wanna know somethin I cant believe 
 Just how much misery 
 Comes with humility 
 Do you think any less of me 
 Now that Im gone 
 Look at me now 
 Everything is gone 
 I cant seem to do anything right 
 But Ive figured out why you dont let me inside 
 You need nothin 
 From me now 
 So you think 
 Im useless to you now 
 But i 
 Need 
 One thing from you now 
 I 
 Insist 
 That you 
 Feel me now 
 You said you needed me 
 You said 
 You dont feel nothing at allSomething ugly this way comes 
 From my fingers sliding inside 
 All these blessings 
 All these words 
 God lives underneath your covers 
 Search for pleasure 
 Search for pain 
 In this world now I am undying 
 And from the flame a nation helpless 
 Black black heart 
 Why would you offer more 
 Why would you make it easier on me 
 To satisfy 
 Im on fire 
 Im rotting to the core 
 Im eating all your kings and queens 
 All your sex and your diamonds 
 As I begin to lose my grip 
 On these realities youre sending 
 Taste your mind and taste your sex 
 Im naked underneath your covers 
 Covers lie and we will blend in morrow 
 With the coming sign 
 The tide will take 
 The sea will rise 
 Time will rape 
 Black black heart 
 All your sex and your diamonds 
 Repeat until endingWere on drugs 
 Were on drugs 
 Were all on drugs 
 In a sentence 
 Do you like drugsI wasnt there for you 
 I wasnt there for you 
 I know weathers gonna be fine 
 But I cant see you cross the streamline 
 My love waits for me in daytime 
 But I cant see you through the snow blind 
 But I wasnt there for you 
 You are gone I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbyes are long 
 Goodbye I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbye 
 I wasnt there for goodbye 
 Well Ive known time reveals in hindsight 
 I can wrestle with the stormy night 
 Because your love lasts a lifetime 
 But I can see you through the snow blind 
 You are gone but I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbyes are long I wasnt there for you 
 I wasnt there 
 SONG MEANING This song is about how Serj lost someone he loved and it was because he wasnt there for her as it says in the song and he can see her going about her own life and he misses herLife is a waterfall 
 Were one in the river and one again after the fall 
 Swimming through the void we hear the word 
 We lose ourselves but we find it all 
 Cause we are the ones that wanna play 
 Always want to go but you never wanna stay 
 We are the ones that wanna choose 
 Always want to play but you never wanna lose 
 Aerials in the sky 
 When you lose small mind you free your life 
 Life is a waterfall 
 We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls 
 Swimming through the void we hear the word 
 Always want to play but you never wanna lose oh 
 Aerials so up high 
 When you free your eyes eternal prize 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh ohEverybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody sighs 
 Everybody everybody everybody lies 
 Its all violent ways 
 The kinda stuff you get on your TV 
 The kinda stuff thats on your TV 
 Its a violent ways 
 The kinda stuff thats on you TV 
 Its a nonstop disco disco ddisco ddisco 
 SONG MEANING Pretty obvious Its about television and how useless it is and how it brainwashes you and fills your head with junkI need I feel a love 
 You love to love the fear 
 I never want to be alone 
 Ive forgotten to The road keeps moving clouds 
 The clouds become unreal 
 I guess Ill always be at home 
 Do you want me to try 
 Directing your night 
 An exit lights the sky 
 The sky becomes complete 
 Traveling hearts divide the throne 
 Ive forgotten to 
 Friction lines bumps 
 The highway song complete 
 The signs are all turning right 
 Want me to try 
 Directing your light 
 The purest forms of life 
 Our days are never coming back 
 The cannons of our time 
 Our days are never ever coming back 
 Our days are never coming backYour world has ended and life for us 
 So has the global marching economy 
 When life as when your own existence is only the wave of your lies 
 When your earth is dying your sky your earth your water and forests 
 Genetic world is picking over mutations of man 
 Your would is dying 
 Blue sky good bye blue sky good bye 
 The CIA has sold you out along with the pentagon 
 For a much better game a much more profitable mortgage 
 Good bye blue sky 
 Multinational corporate America is what you name it not a democracy 
 Good bye blue sky good bye blue sky good bye 
 Good bye blue skys Unless you open your eyes 
 Unless you open your eyes to what in the world is happening 
 The third world is waiting for you to wake up 
 Good bye blue sky goodbyeMelt in the sun melt in the sun 
 Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun 
 Hide in the sky hide in the sky 
 Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky 
 You and me should go outside and 
 Beat em beat em beat em beat em beat em beat em 
 All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and well 
 Eat em eat em eat em eat em eat em eat em 
 Come join the cause come join the cause 
 Who wants to come with me and come join the cause 
 Realize youre blind 
 And were out of time 
 Itll show your mind 
 Melt in the sun melt in the sun 
 All pathetic flag waving ignorant hicks and well 
 Itll show your mind that you have a mindWalk with me my little child 
 To the forest of denial 
 Speak with me my only mind 
 Walk with me until the time 
 And make the forest turn to wine 
 You take the legend for a fall 
 You saw the product 
 Why cant you see that you are my child 
 Why dont you know that you are my mind 
 Tell everyone in the world that Im you 
 Take this promise to the end of you 
 Walk with me my little friend 
 Take this promise to the end 
 Walk with me until the end 
 And make the forest turn to sand 
 Take this promise for a ride 
 You saw the forest now come inside 
 You took the legend for its fall 
 You saw the product of it all 
 No televisions in the air 
 No circumcisions on the chair 
 You made the weapons for us all 
 Just look at us now 
 Take this promise to the end of youThe unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves 
 The senses collect undeniable data 
 Of beta carotene and thetawaves 
 The unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves then 
 The senses wanted the sky 
 All rise eyes bound 
 Time feels like a midnight ride 
 Finality waits outside 
 Weeping in perplexities arms 
 Caressing our smiles inside 
 The national debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves 
 The people collect undeniable data 
 Bout high pulse weapons and microwaves 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves then 
 The people found out the lie 
 Now arise heaven bound 
 Waiting to get you high 
 Waiting to touch the sky 
 Caressing our smiles in 
 SONG MEANING Its about sleep and meditationElimination

 Our days are never ever coming back 
 Burupdurup partTheres nothing wrong with me 
 I cant see your souls through through your eyes 
 Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells 
 Dont eat the fishThe unsettled mind as it climbs in the light 
 The senses collect from the valuable data 
 The unsettled mind as it climbs in the light 
 The senses wander the sky 
 Is there life in waiting for you

 Of eyeballs weapons and microwaves

 Unlike you say say why does it feel like the air wet you 
 I feel like rain and wind and feel like kiss me you and I 
 You fly you fly you flyMy cock is much bigger than yours 
 My cock can walk right through the door 
 With a feeling so pure

 My shit stinks right down through the floor 
 Its got you coming back for more 
 Cant you see that I love my cock 
 Cant you see that you love my cock 
 Cant you see that we love my cock 
 Were the regulators that deregulate

 Were the propagators of all genocide 
 Burning through the worlds resources 
 Then we turn and hide 
 Were cool in denial 
 My cock is much bigger than yours 
 Its got you screaming back for moreBye bye hippies bye bye 
 Bye bye peace corp bye bye 
 Bye bye you damn pricks see you all in hell

 Still drive gas cars piss the hippies off more 
 Or destroy them I prefer destroy 
 Still couldnt give a damn about a grand slamBall games in the refrigerator

 But I was in there for you 
 Now leaving town 
 Seeing you believing

 Believing then kneeling 
 Appeasing

 Were left with no arms 
 Right in the power struggle 
 Wearing the crown 
 Chasing a clown 
 But I was waiting for you 
 Now we have found 
 Left with no arms 
 In the power struggle 
 May I remind you 
 Your life is in a bubble jungle 
 Right here in the power struggle

 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves 
 The senses collect undeniable data 
 About beta carotine and thetawaves 
 The unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Then the senses wanted the sky  
 All rise eyes BOW 
 Time feels like a midnight ride 
 Finality waits outside 
 Weeping in perplexitys arms 
 Caressing our smiles inside  
 The national debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves 
 The people collect undeniable data 
 About high pulse weapons and microwaves 
 Then the people found out the lie  
 Now our eyes have been found 
 Caressing our smiles inside 
 Waiting to get you high 
 Waiting to touch the sky 
 Caressing our smiles inTime is always now and forever 
 Time is always now or never 
 God is now the ruler of the present 
 His son a lesson born of a peasant 
 Here now forever 
 Happiness ends at the end of a beautiful tunnel 
 Now forever 
 Run run run away 
 To a land far away 
 Where the hills are green and the water is gray 
 Maria ran with passion not seen in women 
 Thanks to the big life and her forceful daddy 
 No longer the man 
 No matter 
 Due is her freedom for loneliness with the dollar 
 No longer the man no matter 
 Ive been poisoned by God 
 The devil of money 
 I will never marry till Im ready 
 To be the perfect man 
 Husband of a dream

 Of tellin me bout her

 And then I looked around

 Well I fucked her 
 Right underneath the tree 
 And I cant believe I took her viginity 
 Virginity x 2 
 And then I just woke up

 And I cant believe I took her virginity 
 Virginity

 Livin life in the fast lane no time to feel any pain 
 The way you were brought up left you so stuck up

 And its only now that you just find out 
 All they wanna do is make you bleed 
 Whered it all go Whats it all mean 
 Howd I end up here so far inbetween 
 Where am I going Where have I been 
 What is the circumstance Im living in

 Finding the answer to what lifes about 
 But the more that you ask the less that you see 
 Were a part of this one giant hipocracy 
 Start PRECHORUS 
 And the piper blows 
 And the audience grows 
 Fall to their knees 
 They worship greed 
 And the TV plays 
 Its Simon says 
 Can I make this clear 
 Get me the fuck out of here 
 End PRECHORUS 
 Start CHORUS 
 Stop the world I wanna get off 
 I cant take this bullshit 
 It stinks so bad its making me cough 
 This place is a fucking hell 
 Im so tired of the bullshit smell 
 Mess with me Im bound to get tough 
 Stop the world I wanna get off 
 End CHORUS 
 Everyday is like a sentence 
 A convicted crimminal doing penance 
 But for our sins theres no repentance 
 You are the sorcerers apprentice 
 The living cry for the dying 
 And yes there is no denying 
 That a referee call gonna save us all 
 Instead we find that they are lying 
 Repeat PRECHORUS 
 I wanna tell you that its gonna be fine 
 People like me say it all the time 
 But the truth is you gotta live smart 
 Stick up for yourself take it to the heart 
 Stop the world 
 Stop the worldIm alone sitting with my empty glass 
 My four walls follow me through my past 
 I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain 
 And you were waiting there swimming through apologies 
 I remember searching for the perfect words 
 I was hoping you might change your mind 
 I remember a soldier sleeping next to me 
 Riding on the metro 
 You wore white smiling as you took my hand 
 So removed we spoke of wintertime in France 
 Minutes passed with shallow words 
 Years have passed and still the hurt 
 I can see you now smiling as I pulled away 
 I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand 
 Ill love you always filled my eyes 
 I remember a night we walked along the Seine 
 I remember a feeling coming over me 
 The soldier turned then looked away 
 I remember hating you for loving me 
 Im alone sitting with my broken glass 
 And you were waiting there swimming through apologies  sorry 
 Riding on the metroSorry 
 Im not sorry 
 Sorry to let my life this way 
 Sorry to let myself decay 
 Sorry 
 Sorry to let myself decayFlaunt your will at every wheel 
 Parachute your chocolate soul 
 Cobblestones under your wheels 
 I got pictures on my mind 
 I got pictures on my mind 
 Circumvent your thick ego 
 Wooden farts theyre on the go 
 You cant tell me that Im real 
 Fear waits for us 
 When the present cant be sealed 
 Away gold dust 
 Now the dishes can be cleared 
 Till the moment is revealed 
 Then turns to rust 
 For the mighty conquered meal 
 Cant you look at my shaved ass 
 Ounce is gone and God is once 
 You cant see me suddenly 
 I got pictures on my mindSkaters de Colombia 
 venimos a rapear 
 queremos traer 
 algo original 
 un mensaje sobre 
 la verdad de la vida 
 todo esto sin ninguna mascarilla 
 Colombia vive una ola de violencia 
 debemos tratarlo con mucha paciencia 
 ya que aqui es onde vivimos y tambien nacimos 
 y donde vamos a ver crecer  todos nuestros hijos 
 Debemos pedir al todo poderoso 
 tambien ser un poco carinosos 
 para as construir una nacion 
 donde reine el sk8 y  el amor 
 Ahora entramos a la parte algo tablistica 
 eso si sin mucha logistica 
 Somos un grupo como de hermanos 
 cuando alguien cae se le tiende la mano 
 Pero quienes somos 
 Si no eres tan demente y miras fijamente 
 te podras dar de cuenta que somos 
 la diarrea candente 
 Un grupo bien formado 
 con todo y un nombre 
 lo unico que nos falta 
 es el uniforme 
 En este grupo ya hay de  todo 
 desde un tonton hasta un falton 
 ese falton soy yo ya que a veces no voy 
 y ya la cojieron conmmigo diciendome falton boy 
 Volvemos al tema de la violencia 
 ya que algunos actuan con negligencia 
 son esos del gobierno aqui la gente muerey gatillando 
 y ellos se la pasan pero paseando 
 pero menos mal el 7 de agosto 
 se le acabo el reinadito a don pastranita 
 que ya nos tenia hasta la nuquita 
 Esperamos que le vaya bien a Uribe 
 y que siempre nos diga todo bien como el pibe 
 Bueno espero que lo hayan disfutado y tambien cantado 
 recuerden el sk8 siempre presente 
 en todos estos ambientes 
 recuerdan el nombreCircumventing circuses 
 Lamenting in protest 
 To visible police 
 Presence sponsored fear 
 Battalions of riot police 
 With rubber bullet kisses 
 Baton courtesy 
 Service with a smile 
 Beyond the Staples Center you can see America 
 With its tired poor avenging disgrace 
 Peaceful loving youth against the brutality 
 Of plastic existence 
 Pushing little children 
 With their fully automatics 
 They like to push the weak around 
 A rush of words 
 Pleading to disperse 
 Upon your naked walls alive 
 A political call 
 The fall guy accord 
 We cant afford to be neutral on a moving train 
 Push them around 
 A deer dance invitation to peace 
 War staring you in the face 
 Dressed in black 
 With a helmet fierce 
 Trained and appropriate for the malcontents 
 For the disproportioned malcontents 
 The little boy smiled itll all be well 
 And say the little boy smiled itll all be well 
 Push the weak around 
 They like to push the weak aroundLa la la la la la 
 Hey man look at me rockin out 
 Im on the radio 
 Im on the video 
 With Danny and Lisa 
 They take me away from take away from 
 The strangest places strangest places 
 Sweet Danny and Lisa sweet Danny and Lisa 
 They take me away from 
 The strangest places 
 Sweet Danny and Lisa 
 La la la

 You depend on our protection yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth 
 Lalalala lalalalala ooh 
 Everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Dancing in the desert blowin up the sunshine 
 Kneeling roses disappearing into Mosess dry mouth 
 Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions 
 Hangers sitting dripped in oil crying freedom 
 Handed to obsoletion still you feed us lies from the tablecloth 
 Everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine 
 Well everybodys going to the party have a real good time 
 Blast off its party time 
 And we dont live in a fascist nation 
 And where the fuck are you

 Hangars sitting dripped in oil crying freedom 
 Dancing in the desert blowin up the sun 
 Why do they always send the poor

 Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles 
 My nigga BIG Imma ride for 
 But it aint too many niggas that Id die for

 Into the eyes of the night 
 Button collects price of his time 
 Little girl glared 
 Sheets of the denial 
 The bullet connects to the price of her crime 
 What have we said 
 Wasnt it their bed 
 What of our presence 
 Havent we paid penance 
 Now the little boy sees 
 Through the eyes of delight 
 Levers erect note of his rhyme 
 Little girl bled 
 Sheets of the night 
 The lovers connect to the price of his dime 
 Havent we paid penance 
 To the old gods and moved on 
 To the new guns to the new guns 
 To the new guns to the new gunsWe fought your wars with all our hearts 
 You sent us back in body parts 
 You took our wills with the truth you stole 
 We offer prayers for your long lost soul 
 The remainder is an unjustifiable egotistical power struggle 
 At the expense of the American dream of the American dream 
 Of the American 
 We dont give a damn about your world 
 With all your global profits 
 And all your jeweled pearls 
 Right now right now 
 We dont give a fuck about your world 
 Right now right now right now right now 
 There is no flag that is large enough 
 To hide the shame of a man in cuffs 
 You switched the signs then you closed our blinds 
 You changed the channel then you changed our minds 
 No flag large enough 
 Shame on a man in cuffs 
 They closed our blinds 
 Right now right now right now right nnnnowWhat you get aint what you see 
 Things that dont come easily 
 Feelin happy in my pain 
 Icicles within my brain 
 Cocaine 
 Somethin blowin in my head 
 Winds of ice that soon will spread 
 Death would freeze my very soul 
 Makes me happy makes me cold 
 My eyes are blind but I can see 
 The snowflakes glisten on the trees 
 The sun no longer sets me free 
 I feel the snowflakes freezing me 
 Let the winter sun shine on 
 Let me feel the frost of dawn 
 Fill my dreams with flakes of snow 
 Soon Ill feel the chilling glow 
 Dont you think I know what Im doing 
 Dont tell me that its doing me wrong 
 Youre the one thats really a loser 
 This is where I feel I belong 
 Crystal world with winter flowers 
 Turns my days to frozen hours 
 Lying snowblind in the sun 
 Will my Ice Age ever comeThe kombucha mushroom people 
 Sitting around all day 
 Who could believe you 
 Let your mother pray 
 Sugar

 Trying to push my face to the ground 
 Where all they really want to do 
 Is suck out my motherfucking brains 
 Let your mother pray 
 I sit in my desolate room 
 No lights 
 No music 
 Just anger 
 I killed everyone 
 Im gone away forever 
 But Im feeling better 
 How do I feel what do I say 
 Fuck you it all goes away 
 In the end it all goes away 
 In the end it all goes awayStretching filing against her skin 
 Blessed are those who are not kin 
 In sin we breathe in sex we tie 
 Duct tape her legs to the red sky 
 Foolsome flesh allowances 
 The pansies raided the pantry of 
 Gathering dreams promiscuous 
 Delight deny not the flavor 
 Custard dreams 
 Abusing using 
 Marmalade flesh 
 Naked spread am I am I 
 Actors of the tragic phantom 
 Extend your legs for great Saturn 
 Brown table tops scream for cover 
 At the sight of your new lover 
 If today I die and cant deny 
 The poison chosen for tonight 
 Tonight 
 Borrowed dreams hollowed reveries 
 Metal pillows pewter yellows 
 Furry roadkill house on the hill 
 Pouring gravy on her thighs still 
 TonightAnd the little boy stared 
 Into the eyes of the night 
 Button collects price of his time 
 Little girl glared 
 Sheets of denial 
 Bullet connects to the price of her crime 
 What have we said 
 Wasnt it their bed 
 What of presence 
 Havent we paid penance

 Confidence dreams insecurity 
 Men fall unrealized 
 Unrealized unrealized 
 Making a decision of death 
 While everyone around you plead 
 Now you fly in peace 
 I hope my friend 
 A man cant avoid what hes meant to do 
 When hes meant to do it 
 Even if he doesnt really want to 
 My memories are of fun and friendship 
 Of weakness within the strength of youth 
 For reasons undefined reasons undefined 
 Reasons undefined reasons undefined 
 Your men fall unrealized 
 Dont you realize that evil 
 Lives in a motherfucking skin 
 Lives in the skin 
 Why the fuck did you take him away from us 
 You motherfuckerI dont know why she called 
 Of telling me about her 
 She told me she was the one 
 And that everything was done 
 And then I looked around and 
 When I fucked her 
 Right beneath the tree 
 And I cant believe that I took her virginity

 Who was it there 
 Was it a friend or a foe 
 I didnt wanna know 
 4x 
 Who was it thereWelcome to the soldier side 
 Where theres no one here but me

 Drifting on a stream a stream 
 Consciously it seems 
 All of what remains 
 Ego brain 
 Manmade shame 
 Shame 
 Love after it rains 
 You see my pain is real 
 Watch my world dissolve 
 And pretend that none of us see the fall 
 As I turn to sand 
 You took me by the hand 
 And declared that love prevails over all 
 I am just a man 
 Fighting other men 
 For land for land 
 While I turn to sand 
 In spite of the pain 
 Shame love after it rains 
 Love after it rains

 Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot 
 My horse 
 Is a shackled old man 
 His his remorse 
 Was that he couldnt survey 
 The skies right before 
 Right before they went gray 
 My horse and my remorse 
 Flying over a great bay

 Her discourse 
 Is that we all dont survey 
 Right before they go gray 
 My source and my remorse 
 Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot 
 One that smiled when he flew over the baySuch a lonely day and its mine 
 The most loneliest day of my life 
 Such a lonely day should be banned 
 Its a day that I cant stand 
 Such a lonely day shouldnt exist 
 Its a day that Ill never miss

 And if you die I want to die with you

 Cant you look at my shaved ass 
 Duece is God and got his lungs 
 You can see me Saturday 
 I got pictures on my mindDead men lying on the bottom of the grave 
 Wondering when savior comes is he gonna be saved 
 Maybe youre a sinner into your alternate life 
 Maybe youre a joker maybe you deserve to die 
 They were crying when their sons left 
 God is wearing black 
 Hes gone so far to find no hope 
 Hes never coming back 
 All young men must go 
 Hes come so far to find the truth 
 Hes never going home 
 Young men standing on the top of their own graves 
 Wondering when Jesus comes are they gonna be saved 
 Cruelty to the winner bishop tells the king his lies 
 Maybe youre a mourner maybe you deserve to die 
 Hes come so far to find no truth 
 Welcome to the soldier side 
 There is no one here but me 
 People on the soldier side 
 There is no one here but meSuperstition taking all of us for a ride 
 Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right 
 The bombs are falling overhead with no sight 
 While you are talking all detached so tell us 
 Where youre going to the bottom 
 Do you hear us We are rotting 
 Were going down in a spiral to the ground 
 No one no ones gonna save us now 
 Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide 
 The masked comforts to delusionals theyre all in fright 
 The true believers head was bathed in sunlight 
 While you are walking all detached so tell us 
 Not even God 
 No one saved us no ones gonna save us 
 Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall 
 Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall 
 Superstition taking all of us for a ride 
 The bombs are falling over our head with no sight 
 While you are talking all detached detached detached detached detached 
 No one no ones gonna save us now 
 No one saved us no one saved us 
 No one saved us no ones gonna save us now 
 SONG MEANING This song is about the point of view of a person we are at war against probably in Iraq but could be other wars Its about the US coming in and bombing them and destroying their homes and how the people there cant do much about itPrepare yourself for death 
 Your life is under a trick 
 In the end its obvious that

 Your life is an acronym 
 You hide from life you hide from life 
 Well its all just an acronym 
 I dont know why your talking to me 
 Why why why 
 Fuck you in your flake

 Stay away from me 
 I got a disease 
 Everyone is sleeping 
 Fuck you 
 For putting hate in me 
 For putting faith in me 
 Everyone is sleepingAll that I want all that I need 
 I dont want to camp 
 Dont want to bleed 
 Fight your enemy 
 Change his soul 
 Turn it to be free X2 
 All that I want all that I need 
 I am here in the balcony 
 EndEnd of the world 
 Do you even care 
 And they take it all away 
 Away away away 
 Fall before the girl 
 Do you even want her 
 Are you blind 
 If you werent you were always blind 
 You shake the world with everlasting times 
 Making everyone and every little thing your damn whore 
 Then the end become chaos 
 You shake the world with everlasting timesI need not fear the love 
 You love to love the fear 
 I never want to be alone 
 Ive forgotten too 
 The road keeps moving the clouds 
 The clouds become unreal 
 I guess Ill always be at home 
 Do you want me to try 
 Directing your night 
 An exit lights the sky 
 The sky becomes complete 
 Traveling hearts divine the throne 
 Friction lines bumps 
 The highway song complete 
 The signs are all turning right 
 Want me to try 
 The furious forms of life 
 Our days are never coming back 
 The cannons of our time 
 Our days are never coming backPushing the law again 
 Pushing the law again 
 Justice with a sword 
 Our smiling knight on board 
 Opening his heart to everyone 
 And loving without a doubt 
 Embracing friends and 
 Embarrasing foes 
 And those who are unjust 
 A man true to his heart 
 Without fear or misgivings 
 With insecurity tattooed across his body 
 The first to accept the last to dissapoint 
 He understood all and expected nothing 
 Now you are free 
 Free to roam in the skies 
 Now and then visit me 
 With your starlit eyes 
 NOW 
 You took all our hearts 
 With your smile 
 And left a legacy untold 
 You conquered life and fear 
 So you see there was no room for you to grow old 
 Pushing the law againThe unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for them selves 
 About beta carotine and theta waves 
 Then the senses wanted the sky 
 Is there life looking for you 
 Is there life in waiting for you 
 Waiting for you 
 The National debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for them selves 
 Then the people found out the lie 
 Is there life in looking for you 
 Waiting for you 
 Waiting for youPeters pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper

 WHY And we light up the sky

 Bicycle shoestrings

 IEAIAIO IEAIAIO 
 WHY As we light up the sky 
 WHY And we light up the skyWell I have a home longing to roam 
 I have to find you I have to meet you 
 Signs of your face slowing your pace 
 I need your guidance I need to seek my 
 Innervision innervision 
 My pupils dance lost in a trance 
 Your sacred silence losing all violence 
 Stars in their place mirror your face 
 I need to find you I need to seek my 
 Innervision innervision innervision 
 Its never too late to reinvent the bicycle 
 A smile brings forth energy or life 
 Giving you force 
 Vision

 The road that leads to all leads to one 
 Innervision Theres only one true path in life 
 Innervision The road that leads to all 
 Innervision 
 Your sacred silence losing all violenceDr Jekyll in lower case 
 Mr Hyde caps 
 Lost in the darkness 
 Silence surrounds you 
 Once there was morning 
 Now endless night 
 I will find the answer 
 Ill never desert you 
 I promise you this 
 Till the day that I 
 Do you really think 
 That I would ever let you go 
 Do you think id ever set you free 
 If you do Im sad to say 
 It simply isnt so 
 You will never get away from me 
 All that you are is a face in the mirror 
 I close my eyes and you disappear 
 Im what you face when you face in the mirror 
 Long as you live I will still be here 
 All that you are is an end of a nightmare 
 All that you are is a dying scream 
 After tonight I shall end this demon dream 
 This is not a dream my friend 
 And it will never end 
 This one is the nightmare that goes on 
 Hyde is here to stay 
 No matter what you may pretend 
 And hell flourish long after youre gone 
 Soon you will die and my silence will hide you 
 You cannot choose and youll lose control 
 You cant control me 
 I live deep inside you 
 Each day you feel me devour your soul 
 I dont need you to survive like you need me 
 I become whole as you dance with Death 
 And I will rejoice as you breathe your final breath 
 For I live inside you forever 
 With Satan himself by my side 
 And now know that now and forever 
 Youll never be able to separate 
 Jekyll from hyde 
 Cant you see 
 Its over now 
 Its time to die 
 No not i 
 Only you 
 If I die 
 You die to 
 Youll die in me 
 Ill be you 
 Damn you Hyde 
 Set me free 
 You are me 
 No deep inside 
 I am you 
 You are hyde 
 No never 
 Yes foreverBreathing each others lives 
 Holding this in mind 
 That if we fall we all fall 
 And we fall alone 
 The cold insincerity of steel machines 
 Have consumed our euphoria 
 Transforming us into muted dreams 
 Dreaming of the day that 
 We attack 
 Attack attack your fetal servitude 
 Attack attack attack with pesticide 
 All the years of propaganda 
 We shall attack 
 Books illustrate what we already know 
 Candles cry towards the sky 
 Racing your flags along polluted coast 
 Attack 
 Attack 
 Breathing each others lives 
 Whats the philosophy of displaced minds 
 The bombing of all homes and villages 
 Truth is the only sword bleeding minds 
 Bleeding till the day that 
 We shall attack 
 Attack all the homes and villages 
 Attack all the schools and hospitals 
 You attack all the rapes and pillages 
 We shall attackPoisoning a drink 
 Bleeding in a sink 
 Choking with a link 
 Killing with a stink 
 Just your mothers 
 Ho 
 Poisoning a drink 
 Burning up 
 My sweet Clementine 
 Trampling a shrink 
 Hallelujah wink 
 Getting on the brink 
 Murdering a shrink 
 All my sweet revenge 
 Will be yours for the taking 
 Its in the making baby 
 My sweet revenge 
 I saw her laugh 
 Then she said Go away 
 Then she said then she said 
 Go away away 
 Will be yours its in the making 
 Its in the taking making baking taking faking 
 Ho my sweet Clementine 
 Shoulda been coulda been 
 Woulda been woulda been you 
 Woulda been woulda been youYoure a grand ole flag youre a high flying flag 
 And forever in peace may you wave 
 Youre the emblem of 
 The land I love 
 The home of the free and the brave 
 Evry Heart beats true for the red white and blue 
 Where there is never a boast or brag 
 Should all aquitance be forgot 
 Keep your eye on the Grand Ole FlagLife is a story 
 Go ahead and find your sight 
 Life is your glory 
 Go ahead and live the night 
 But to live means to be here 
 In the present now 
 Do you try to bow for the gift of your day 
 Then you cede to the morning sun 
 Pretending that we live doesnt make us alive 
 Life is a story 
 Pretending that we see doesnt give us the sight 
 What is it that makes us lose sight 
 True sight of what is real and essential 
 Ill take organised patterns of chaos 
 Over the chaotic organisations of man any day 
 The patterns in the carpet do add up though 
 You dont have to count 
 You dont have to countWatching from a post up high 
 From where you see the ships afar 
 From a welltrained eye 
 The waves all keep on crashing by 
 If you are the light post 
 Then you own the working class 
 But if you want the answers 
 You better give a piece of ass 
 Give a piece of your ass 
 Warning post hypnotic suggestions 
 Running the ships ashore 
 The orange light that follows 
 Will soon proclaim itself a god 
 If you point your questions 
 The fog will surely chew you up 
 You better get ready for the fire 
 Get ready for the fire 
 The ships are multiplying day after day sir 
 And theyre coming close to the shore sir shore sir 
 We need to evacuate the light post 
 Its all over its all over 
 Its all over 
 SONG MEANING Serj Tankian the lead singer says this song is about posthypnotic suggestion being used in the assassination of President Kennedy Go figurePreflight delight 
 Defaced street lights 
 A pyramid mind fuck 
 Dont leave your seats now 
 Popcorn everywhere canned 
 Cliche people organs rare 
 Corn everywhere canned 
 Rare repeat 
 I want to be 
 A fallen ruby 
 Guest vibrations 
 Humans everywhere canned 
 Cliche people cannot dare 
 Dare repeat 
 Cliche people cannot dare dare dare dare 
 SONG MEANING This song is about how culture is becoming dumber and dumber with lamer and lamer clichesIm wishin and wishin away at you God 
 Im wishin and wishin away at you God 
 I dont see nothing but pain and misery cause 
 You are the one for me why cant it all be true 
 Can I escape with my blue fallen revery 
 Why cant it all be true why cant it all be true 
 Suddenly I believe you are the one for me 
 Graciously you move through my closed heart artery 
 Ive been wishin away at you 
 Ive been wishin away at you God 
 Wishin and wishin away at you God 
 At you God at you God at you GodFor today we will take the body parts 
 And put them on the wall 
 For treated indigenously digenously 
 Human right is private blue chip pry 
 Were the prophetic generation of bottled water bottled water 
 Causing poor populations to die to die to die 
 For treated indigenously digenously 
 Human right is private blue chip pry 
 You you went beyond and you lost it all 
 Why did you go there 
 From beyond you saw it all 
 Why did you 
 We lost consumer confidence in casual karma casual karma 
 Confetti camouflage camouflage the flage the flage 
 She lost her mind 
 Someone kicked her into the back of the line 
 She lost her head 
 When they called and they said that they thought he was dead 
 Dreaming of screaming 
 Someone kick me out of my mind 
 I hate these thoughts I cant deny 
 I hate these thoughts I cant de 
 Why did you 
 I hate these thoughts I cant deny 
 You will take the body parts and put them up on the wall 
 And bring the dark disaster 
 SONG MEANING Its about how people are self serving and how they dont see the bigger picture of the less fortunatePlagiarized existence exist 
 Among the writers of the word 
 Shake your spear at Shakespeare 
 Loud and noisy 
 Strong refrigerators 
 Gaining independence 
 Stupid people do stupid things 
 Smart people outsmart each other 
 Then themselves then themselves 
 Take me down there 
 Photographic relapse 
 People feeding frenzy 
 The devil is so lovely 
 So lovely 
 My blue moon rivets in exits 
 Forewarned customary spirits 
 By myself by myself 
 SONG MEANING This song is about dealing with corrupt companiesIm but a little bit bit bit show 
 Just the back 
 We all need to fuck the system 
 SONG MEANING This song is kind of self explanatoryTell the people 
 Tell the people that arrive 
 Tell the people 
 We dont need to multiply 
 Die 
 Show your people 
 Show your people how we died 
 We dont need to nullify 
 No need to nullify 
 We dont need to 
 Ask your people 
 Ask your people what is right 
 No need to multiply 
 We dont need to multiplyMisshapen Crown 
 Life in a bubble Jungle 
 It showed another jungle 
 Staying in the crown 
 Seeing you believing the satiric with the power struggle 
 Believing then dealing appeasing the power struggle 
 Were left with no arms right in the power struggle 
 But showed another jungle 
 Left with arms In the power struggle 
  
 Foreign chant 
 Life is but a big bulge 
 Left with arms right here In the power struggleHey Mr Jack 
 Is that the mouth wash in your eyes 
 Hey Mr Jack 
 Is that the cause of your surprise 
 Hey where you at 
 On the side of the freeway in the car 
 In the car 
 On the side of the freeway in the 
 Is that the trick of your disguise 
 Is that the cause of your demise 
 Wake up 
 Seven am morning came to take us away 
 Little men big guns pointing at our heads 
 Little men big guns pointing at our heads 
 At our at our heads 
 Your prospect of living gone 
 You ran the light at dawn 
 Protectors on your back 
 Lights are on their track 
 You must now face authority 
 Youre nothing like me 
 Put your hands up get out of the car 
 Fuck you pig 
 SONG MEANING Mr Jack is an alcoholic pulled over for driving under the influence Its not actually antiauthority as commonly believedConquest to the lover 
 And your love to the fire 
 Permanence unfolding in the absolute 
 Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice 
 Eloquence belongs to the conqueror 
 The pictures of time and space are rearranged 
 In this little piece of typical tragedy 
 Justified candy 
 Brandy for the nerves 
 You and me 
 Well all go down in history 
 With a sad Statue of Liberty 
 And a generation that didnt agree 
 I forgot to 
 I forgot to let you know that 
 Conquest to the lover 
 Generation 
 What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering 
 Suffering suffering now 
 Belonging 
 Belonging toNow we want peace without patriot missiles 
 Blown to bits are civilian targets 
 Parade Laugh Rejoice Sing 
 We are the victors of nothing 
 Spend more money on a war 
 Your people starved and turn to whores 
 Slaves of the chosen ones paying millions for each bomb 
 Country without a race 
 Formed from people you disgrace 
 White right conservative might 
 Killers of Kennedy with no fright 
 The American way 
 Freedom cried the marching man 
 Flags ripped out of their black hands 
 Beaten Slain Tortured Killed 
 Their only mistake was being born here 
 Invade countries just for oil 
 Send your troops all down to boil 
 Iraq Grenada Nam and Chile 
 Truman doctrine our own way 
 The government here can suck my balls 
 Policing the world in overalls 
 Armed rebellion minority 
 Disrespected race colored mind 
 Crazed loonies all walk the streets 
 Missing children on milk cartons 
 Mother selling child for crack 
 Mr President check your back 
 The American wayTheres nothing wrong with me 
 Theres something wrong with you 
 Theres something wrong with me 
 I hope your stepson doesnt eat the fish 
 When were crying for our next fix 
 Theres nothing wrong with me 
 Killers never hurt feelings 
 Gonorrhea Gorgonzola 
 Single files of clean feedings 
 I cant see your soul soul through your eyes 
 The crying walls of sliding architecture 
 Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture 
 Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells 
 Wrong with you and I 
 Dont eat the fish 
 SONG MEANING This song is basically about Americas rising obsession with drugsShes like heroin 
 Sipping through a little glass 
 Im looking for some help 
 I need someone to save her ass 
 Chinese tricks in rooms 
 With ghosts of hooker girlie dudes 
 Me and heroin 
 Maybe we can make some cash selling 
 Ass 
 Selling ass for heroin 
 She wants nothing more 
 But to be a little whore 
 He wants nothing less 
 But to wear a little dress 
 Shes like heroin 
 I need someone to make some cash selling 
 Maybe we can make some cash 
 I need someone to save my assWhat if theres no more poor to help 
 Another God is what I am 
 What if I have forgotten how 
 Come out houses and get out now 
 Get out right now 
 Theres something shook up in me 
 Theres something I dont wanna see 
 But is it growin in me CLUE 
 It is the hardest thing to do 
 You watch it grow on top of you 
 I see youre just like everyone NEVER 
 But it it growin in me 
 I dont speak that language any more 
 My blood is not that color any more 
 My blood is not that same way any more 
 I cannot deny it any more UGH 
 But is it growin in me 
 ThanksWhats my problem Heres my problem 
 My problem is that Im too visual to be blind 
 Too audiological to be deaf 
 Too ideological to be in peace 
 Too compassionate to be in war 
 Too crazy to be sane 
 Too sane to be lazy 
 Too emotional to be you 
 If I could only stop my head from going into constant infection 
 Then maybe I could swim back to my own version of consistent sanity 
 Angelic demons liquid dreams transparent mountains of our own reality 
 Burning oceans melting faces melting faces why 
 Then maybe I could swim back into my own version of consistent sanity 
 Lying pictures screaming metal in my control 
 Amnesia hysteria insomnia constant canutations until youre in the hospital and youre 
 Fucking DEAD 
 LYING PICTURES SCREAMING METAL In my control 
 Baby my minds got it all in control 
 Maybe Im not in controlEverybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody fucks 
 Everybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody sucks 
 Everybody everybody everybody cries 
 Everybody everybody everybody dies

 IEAIAIO 
 And we light up the sky 
 Mind illusions acquainted 
 Bubbles erotica 
 Bicycle shoestrings 
 One flag 
 Flag number one 
 Painting the paintings of the alive 
 And we light up the skyDark is the light 
 The man you fight 
 With all your prayers incantations 
 Running away a trivial day 
 Of judgment and deliverance 
 To whom was sold this bounty soul 
 A gentile or a priest 
 Who victored over the Seljuks 
 When the Holy Land was taken 
 We will fight the heathens we will fight the heathens 
 Was it the riches of the land 
 Powers of bright darkness 
 That lead the noble to the East 
 To fight the heathens 
 We must call upon our bright darkness 
 Beliefs theyre the bullets of the wicked 
 One was written on the sword 
 For you must enter a room to destroy it destroy it destroy it 
 Now international security 
 The call of the righteous man 
 Needs a reason to kill man 
 History teaches us so 
 The reason he must attain 
 Must be approved by his God 
 His child partisan brother of war 
 Of war we dont speak anymore 
 We will fight the heathens we will fight the heathensI fuck yo ass up

 People all grow up to die 
 There is no one here but meIm alone sitting with my broken glass 
 I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain 
 And you waiting there swimming through apologies 
 I remember the soldier standing next to me 
 I went smiling as you took my hand 
 So removed we spoke in France 
 You were passed as shallow word 
 It isnt passed theres still a hurt 
 I can see you now smiling as I pulled away 
 Sorry 
 Ill love you always filled my eyes 
 I remember the night we walked along the Seine 
 The soldier turned then walked away 
 Fuck you for loving me 
 Riding on the metroAh ahah ah ahahah 
 Ah ahah ah ahahah 
 Can you feel their haunting presence 
 Liar killer demon 
 Back to the 
 River Aras 
 Someones blank stare deemed it warfare 
 Back to the River Aras 
 Freedom 
 Were free 
 Can you hear the Holy Mountains 
 Someones mouth said Paint them all red 
 Free 
 They have all returned resting on the mountain side 
 We have learned that you have no 
 They have returned resting on the mountain side 
 Honor murderer sodomizer 
 They have returned resting on the mountain side 
 Ah ahah ah ahahahYeah all right 
 Yeah all right 
 Two skies 
 Watching it all fading 
 Living it all fading 
 Two skies fading 
 Ones abating 
 Two sons 
 Living it all dying 
 Two sons fighting 
 Ones abiding 
 Watching them both fighting 
 Seeing them both dying 
 Crack pipes needles PCP and fast cars 
 Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star 
 If I feel like talking I never be wrong 
 If I feel like walking you best come along 
 I close my windows crank the heat up high 
 Til my palms are wet and my tongue is dry 
 Im looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die 
 Im a midnight fistfight 
 Looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Alright 
 Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die alright 
 Two sons fighting ones abiding 
 Two skies fading ones abating 
 Cause Im looking for a mother that will get me high 
 Im a stupid motherfucker if I die I die 
 Two skies two sons watching them all go 
 Yeah all rightKaleidoscope of love 
 Ophidians dance as the shifting occurs 
 We are stars and electric animals 
 Nurtured by the mothers of prostitutes 
 Floating in a Mushroom Universe 
 Swimming in a sea of Cyclostomes 
 And as we surface into the Tide 
 You open up and I come inside 
 I must be in Limbo 
 Cause Purgatorys always 
 Felt just like home 
 And as the world spins round and round 
 We fornicate upon the cotton clouds 
 That rain down sulfur smiles 
 Upon the children at play 
 In the poppy fields 
 Sinking for what seems like Forever 
 Like Atlantis into the Sea 
 To forget the shore and wash away 
 Wash away my memory 
 Inside the moon 
 Lives the High Priest 
 Of the Mushroom Cult 
 Upon the Altar 
 Are the ashes 
 Of the Pharisees 
 Ive sold my soul 
 Sold my soul 
 Soul my soul away 
 Im free of guilt 
 Free of sin 
 Free of everything 
 Free of everythingJump 
 Bounce 
 Down 
 Up 
 Jump 
 Pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo 
 Pogo pogo pogo 
 Pogo 
 I went out on a date 
 With a girl a bit late 
 She had so many friends 
 Gliding through many hands 
 I brought my pogo stick 
 Just to show her a trick 
 Unannounced Twister games 
 All players with no names 
 They lined up double quick 
 But just one pogo stick 
 Everyone gets to play 
 Runaway exposé 
 It was so exotic 
 Oh I like to spread you out 
 Touching whoevers behind 
 DownAint no more sunshine just rain and cold suffering 
 Generation born to die with their eyes wide open 
 The clock strikes 
 The wrong rights 
 The mob rules 
 The second Armageddon igniting the lit fuse 
 No turning back and every soldier is on point 
 Ready to die the confrontation coming ready of not Its on again 
 Its time to say your prayers again 
 Its not the end just the beginning of the end 
 Is it hard 
 Yeah I can hold it down like that Is it real 
 Yeah You know I break it down like that 
 Is it rough 
 Dont even try to front like that 
 Im on fire baby a big dog will hunt like that 
 Another day another buster wanna battle me 
 Another mamma crying now her baby is a casualty 
 Im ready nigga slice like a machete nigga 
 Got fetty nigga never spend it on Betty nigga 
 I hit and run never stressing to look back 
 When I look back I think about the love I never had 
 Then I wake up I get fucked up and I get even 
 Approach you from the front 
 While in your back a knife 
 Im leaving 
 The sky is falling I dont care 
 I just want to feel good 
 Her trains leaving she dont care 
 She just wants to feel good 
 The World is dying we dont care 
 We just want to feel good 
 Its all over we dont care 
 No we cant compromise like that 
 No we cant conform like that 
 Im saying fuck you and fuck the norm like that 
 Revolt and transform like that 
 Make a difference 
 Have an impact 
 It wont stop raining its flooding Revelation was all true 
 You drew first blood Jesus is coming to take you 
 Coming to break you make you just like new 
 Satan laughing spreads his wings and gets a new tattoo 
 A new platinum chain a new pinky ring the rolex the benz 
 The huggy bear pimp thing 
 Nigga its midnight never forget where you come from 
 Keep your mouth shut Back the fuck up 
 Watch what you doingSuch a lonely day and its mine 
 Such a lonely day should be banned 
 The most lonely day of my life 
 Such a lonely day shouldnt exist 
 Such a lonely day and its mine 
 Its a day that Im glad I survived 
  
 Added by Mike DiehlI cannot disguise 
 All the stomach pains and the walking of the canes 
 When you do come out 
 And you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy 
 But I cannot grow 
 Til you eat the last of me oh when will I be free 
 And you a parasite 
 Just find another host just another fool to roast 
 Cause you 
 My tapeworm tells me what to do 
 You 
 My tapeworm tells me where to go 
 Pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey 
 I cannot deny 
 All the evil traits and the filling of the crates 
 And you slither up to me in your pimping majesty 
 Till you eat the last of me oh when will I be free 
 Just find another host just another stool to post 
 Pull the tapeworm out of me 
 Im sitting in my room with a needle in my hand 
 Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man 
 Sitting in my room with a needle in my hand

 SONG MEANING This song is basically saying how mankind isnt human anymoreIll wait here 
 Youre crazy 
 Those vicious streets are filled with strays 
 You shouldve never gone to Hollywood 
 They find you 
 Twotime you 
 Say youre the best theyve ever seen 
 You shouldve never trusted Hollywood 
 I wrote you 
 And told you 
 You were the biggest fish out here 
 They take you 
 And make you 
 They look at you in disgusting ways 
 I was standing on the wall 
 Feeling ten feet tall 
 All you maggots 
 Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard 
 This is my front page 
 This is my new age 
 All you bitches put your hands in the air 
 And wave them like you just dont care 
 Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard 
 Phony people come to pray 
 Look at all of them beg to stay 
 The lines in the letter said 
 We have gone to Hackensack 
 Smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard

 In the prison system prison system of the US 
 Theyre trying to build a prison 
 For you and me to live in 
 Another prison system

 Has doubled since 1985

 And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences 
 Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world

 And train brutal corporatesponsored dictators around the world

 The armed response of an entire nation 
 Weve taken all your shit

 Fuck you like a dog 
 Well I see you barking like a dog 
 Well I see you barking like a dogCursed Earth cursed Earth cursed Earth cursed Earth 
 Ill never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart 
 All because we all live in the valley of the walls 
 When they speak we can peek from the windows of their mouths 
 To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun 
 You never think you know why know 
 Ever think you know why know 
 Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings 
 Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything 
 The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead 
 But nows a bird able to fly able to die able to fuck your brothers earth 
 On the other side on the other side the other side 
 Do you ever try to fly do you ever try to fly 
 Have you ever wanted to die have you ever wanted to die 
 Dont ever try to fly dont ever try to fly 
 Dont ever try to fly unless you leave your body on the other side 
 Never try to die you ever try to die 
 Ever think you know why knowThe piercing radiant moon

 The storming of poor June  
 Storming of poor June 
 All the life running through her hair  
 Through her hair 
 Approaching guiding light  
 Approaching guiding light 
 Our shallow years in fright  
 Our shallow years in fright 
 Dreams are made winding  
 Dreams are made winding 
 Through my head  
 Through my head 
 Before you know awake 
 Your lives are open wide 
 The Vchip gives them sight 
 Of all the life running through her hair 
 The spiders all in tune 
 The evening of the moon 
 Before you know 
 Before you know I will be waiting all awake 
 Dreams are made winding through her hair 
 Dreams are made winding through her hairMaking two possibilities a reality 
 Predicting the future of things we all know 
 Fighting off the diseased programming 
 Of centuries centuries centuries centuries 
 Science fails to recognize the single most 
 Potent element of human existence 
 Letting the reins go to the unfolding 
 Is faith faith faith faith 
 Science has failed our world 
 Science has failed our Mother Earth 
 Spirit moves through all things 
 Science has failed our Mother EarthIve been walking through your streets 
 Where all your moneys earned 
 Where all your buildings crying 
 And clueless neckties working 
 Revolving fake lawn houses 
 Housing all your fears 
 Desensitized by TV 
 Overbearing advertising 
 God of consumerism 
 And all your crooked pictures looking good 
 Mirrorism 
 Filtering information for the public eye 
 Designed for profiteering 
 Your neighbor what a guy 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Every time you drop the bomb 
 You kill the god your child has borne 
 Modern globalization 
 Coupled with condemnations 
 Unnecessary death 
 Matador corporations 
 Puppeting your frustrations 
 With a blinded flag 
 Manufacturing consent 
 Is the name of the game 
 The bottom line is money 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 Four thousand hungry children leave us per hour from starvation 
 While billions are spent on bombs 
 Creating death showers 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Why must we kill our own kind 
 You kill the god your child has born 
 Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom 
 Every time you drop the boomI had an out of body experience 
 The other day 
 Her name was Jesus 
 And for her everyone cried 
 Everyone cried 
 Everyone cried 
 Try her philosophy 
 Try 
 You die for her philosophy 
 Die for her philosophy 
 Die her philosophy 
 Die 
 Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture 
 Led me thy blades 
 Were crossed and terrored ravages of architecture 
 Hoist around the spade 
 Die 
 Why 
 Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go through our souls 
 Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go all through our souls 
 Die 
 Like a mother fucker 
 Why 
 Like a mother fucker like a mother fucker 
 I want to fuck my way to the garden 
 Cause everyone needs a mother fucker 
 The following of a Christ 
 The falling of Christ 
 The falling of ChristYou get a shiver in the park 
 Its raining in the dark but meantime 
 South of the river you stop and you hold everything 
 A band is blowing Dixie double four time 
 You feel alright when you hear that music ring 
 Now you step inside you dont see too many faces 
 Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down 
 Competition from other places 
 But the horns be blowing that sound 
 Well on downsouth well on downsouth London town 
 We are the System 
 We are the System Of A DownConversion software version 70 
 Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub 
 Eating seeds as a pastime activity 
 The toxicity of our city of our city 
 New what do you own the world 
 How do you own disorder disorder 
 Now somewhere between the sacred silence 
 Sacred silence and sleep 
 Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep 
 Disorder disorder disorder 
 Hmm hmm 
 More wood for their fires loud neighbors 
 Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck 
 New what do you own the world 
 How do you own disorder 
 Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep 
 When I became the sun 
 I shone life into the mans hearts 
 I shone life into the mans heartsEveryday is nothing but stress to me 
 Constantly dwellin on how you got the best of me 
 Wanna know somethin 
 I cant believe the way you keep testin me 
 And mentally molestin me 
 But would you think any less of me 
 If I said that Id be there 
 Would you think any less of me 
 If I said I really cared 
 Of course you would 
 Cause you 
 Only want what you cant have 
 As for me 
 Im stuck with my dick in my hand 
 Because you dont feel nothing at all 
 You dont feel nothing at all 
 Maybe theres more to life then it seems 
 Im constantly runnin from reality chasin dreams 
 Wanna know somethin I cant believe 
 Just how much misery 
 Comes with humility 
 Do you think any less of me 
 Now that Im gone 
 Look at me now 
 Everything is gone 
 I cant seem to do anything right 
 But Ive figured out why you dont let me inside 
 You need nothin 
 From me now 
 So you think 
 Im useless to you now 
 But i 
 Need 
 One thing from you now 
 I 
 Insist 
 That you 
 Feel me now 
 You said you needed me 
 You said 
 You dont feel nothing at allSomething ugly this way comes 
 From my fingers sliding inside 
 All these blessings 
 All these words 
 God lives underneath your covers 
 Search for pleasure 
 Search for pain 
 In this world now I am undying 
 And from the flame a nation helpless 
 Black black heart 
 Why would you offer more 
 Why would you make it easier on me 
 To satisfy 
 Im on fire 
 Im rotting to the core 
 Im eating all your kings and queens 
 All your sex and your diamonds 
 As I begin to lose my grip 
 On these realities youre sending 
 Taste your mind and taste your sex 
 Im naked underneath your covers 
 Covers lie and we will blend in morrow 
 With the coming sign 
 The tide will take 
 The sea will rise 
 Time will rape 
 Black black heart 
 All your sex and your diamonds 
 Repeat until endingWere on drugs 
 Were on drugs 
 Were all on drugs 
 In a sentence 
 Do you like drugsI wasnt there for you 
 I wasnt there for you 
 I know weathers gonna be fine 
 But I cant see you cross the streamline 
 My love waits for me in daytime 
 But I cant see you through the snow blind 
 But I wasnt there for you 
 You are gone I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbyes are long 
 Goodbye I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbye 
 I wasnt there for goodbye 
 Well Ive known time reveals in hindsight 
 I can wrestle with the stormy night 
 Because your love lasts a lifetime 
 But I can see you through the snow blind 
 You are gone but I wasnt there for you 
 Goodbyes are long I wasnt there for you 
 I wasnt there 
 SONG MEANING This song is about how Serj lost someone he loved and it was because he wasnt there for her as it says in the song and he can see her going about her own life and he misses herLife is a waterfall 
 Were one in the river and one again after the fall 
 Swimming through the void we hear the word 
 We lose ourselves but we find it all 
 Cause we are the ones that wanna play 
 Always want to go but you never wanna stay 
 We are the ones that wanna choose 
 Always want to play but you never wanna lose 
 Aerials in the sky 
 When you lose small mind you free your life 
 Life is a waterfall 
 We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls 
 Swimming through the void we hear the word 
 Always want to play but you never wanna lose oh 
 Aerials so up high 
 When you free your eyes eternal prize 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh ohEverybody everybody everybody livin now 
 Everybody everybody everybody sighs 
 Everybody everybody everybody lies 
 Its all violent ways 
 The kinda stuff you get on your TV 
 The kinda stuff thats on your TV 
 Its a violent ways 
 The kinda stuff thats on you TV 
 Its a nonstop disco disco ddisco ddisco 
 SONG MEANING Pretty obvious Its about television and how useless it is and how it brainwashes you and fills your head with junkI need I feel a love 
 You love to love the fear 
 I never want to be alone 
 Ive forgotten to The road keeps moving clouds 
 The clouds become unreal 
 I guess Ill always be at home 
 Do you want me to try 
 Directing your night 
 An exit lights the sky 
 The sky becomes complete 
 Traveling hearts divide the throne 
 Ive forgotten to 
 Friction lines bumps 
 The highway song complete 
 The signs are all turning right 
 Want me to try 
 Directing your light 
 The purest forms of life 
 Our days are never coming back 
 The cannons of our time 
 Our days are never ever coming back 
 Our days are never coming backYour world has ended and life for us 
 So has the global marching economy 
 When life as when your own existence is only the wave of your lies 
 When your earth is dying your sky your earth your water and forests 
 Genetic world is picking over mutations of man 
 Your would is dying 
 Blue sky good bye blue sky good bye 
 The CIA has sold you out along with the pentagon 
 For a much better game a much more profitable mortgage 
 Good bye blue sky 
 Multinational corporate America is what you name it not a democracy 
 Good bye blue sky good bye blue sky good bye 
 Good bye blue skys Unless you open your eyes 
 Unless you open your eyes to what in the world is happening 
 The third world is waiting for you to wake up 
 Good bye blue sky goodbyeMelt in the sun melt in the sun 
 Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun 
 Hide in the sky hide in the sky 
 Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky 
 You and me should go outside and 
 Beat em beat em beat em beat em beat em beat em 
 All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and well 
 Eat em eat em eat em eat em eat em eat em 
 Come join the cause come join the cause 
 Who wants to come with me and come join the cause 
 Realize youre blind 
 And were out of time 
 Itll show your mind 
 Melt in the sun melt in the sun 
 All pathetic flag waving ignorant hicks and well 
 Itll show your mind that you have a mindWalk with me my little child 
 To the forest of denial 
 Speak with me my only mind 
 Walk with me until the time 
 And make the forest turn to wine 
 You take the legend for a fall 
 You saw the product 
 Why cant you see that you are my child 
 Why dont you know that you are my mind 
 Tell everyone in the world that Im you 
 Take this promise to the end of you 
 Walk with me my little friend 
 Take this promise to the end 
 Walk with me until the end 
 And make the forest turn to sand 
 Take this promise for a ride 
 You saw the forest now come inside 
 You took the legend for its fall 
 You saw the product of it all 
 No televisions in the air 
 No circumcisions on the chair 
 You made the weapons for us all 
 Just look at us now 
 Take this promise to the end of youThe unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves 
 The senses collect undeniable data 
 Of beta carotene and thetawaves 
 The unsettled mind is at times an ally 
 Leaving the senses to fend for themselves then 
 The senses wanted the sky 
 All rise eyes bound 
 Time feels like a midnight ride 
 Finality waits outside 
 Weeping in perplexities arms 
 Caressing our smiles inside 
 The national debt is at times an ally 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves 
 The people collect undeniable data 
 Bout high pulse weapons and microwaves 
 Leaving the people to fend for themselves then 
 The people found out the lie 
 Now arise heaven bound 
 Waiting to get you high 
 Waiting to touch the sky 
 Caressing our smiles in 
 SONG MEANING Its about sleep and meditationElimination 
 Elimination 
 Why 
 A whole race genocide 
 Taken away all of our pride 
 Watch them all fall down 
 Revolution the only solution 
 Now its time for restitution 
 Recognition restoration reparation 
 Now its time for restitution 
 The plan was mastered and called genocide never want to see you around 
 Took all the children and then we died never want to see you around 
 The few that remained were never found never want to see you around 
 All in a system

 All in a system downI need the feel the love 
 I never wanna be alone

 The road keeps the clouds 
 Do you want me to try 
 Traveling us  divide the throne 
 Directing your light 
 Burupdurup part 
 The purest forms of life 
 The canons of our time 
 The purest forms of life  
 Our days are never ever coming back 
 Burupdurup partTheres nothing wrong with me 
 I cant see your souls through through your eyes 
 Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells 
 Dont eat the fishThe unsettled mind as it climbs in the light 
 The senses collect from the valuable data 
 The unsettled mind as it climbs in the light 
 The senses wander the sky 
 Is there life in waiting for you 
 Waiting for you 
 The national debt as it climbs in the light 
 Of eyeballs weapons and microwaves 
 Waiting to touch the sky
