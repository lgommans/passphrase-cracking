 Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you 
 Angels have no thought of ever returning you 
 Would they be angry if I thought of joining you? 
 Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all 
 My heart and I have decided to end it all 
 Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know 
 Let them not weep let them know that I'm glad to go 
 Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you 
 With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you. 
 Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you. 
 You know my love of dreams.

 They don't rule it, nobody does 
 They don't run in packs 
 While they may not be as strong as apes 
 Don't lock eyes with them. don't do it 
 It puts them on edge 
 They might go into berserker mode 
 They'll come at you like a whirling dervish, all fists and elbows 
 You might be screaming "No, no, no!"

 Les joies du soir et du matin 
 Qui filent a toute vitesse 
 Tant pis pour les chagrins, les douleurs, et les énervements 
 Qui passent lentement 
 Et qui se crochent 
 Oui mais voila, je sais que je dois 
 Chaque jour,chaque heure 
 M'avancer vers cette falaise 
 Et vers ce grand trou sans fond

 Tnaslation (From French): 
 I haven't finished hoping 
 Infallible like a spider 
 I watch for the future 
 Towards my daily web 
 The joys of the evening and the morning 
 That escape at top speed 
 Too bad for the sorrows, the pains, and the irritations 
 That pass slowly 
 And hook themselves 
 Yes, but that is it; I know that I must 
 Each day, each hour 
 Advance towards that cliff 
 And towards that bottomless pit 
 I return often 
 And notice 
 Very far away 
 The fog of my birth 
 I am the nomad 
 Who walks the night 
 And who waits for day 
 And forgets it.....Good times for a change

 Haven't had a dream in a long time
