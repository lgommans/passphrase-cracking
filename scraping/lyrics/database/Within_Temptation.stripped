I cant sleep cause its burnin deep inside 
 Like gasoline on fire runnin wild 
 No more fear cause Im gettin closer now 
 So unreal but I like it anyhow 
 I go faster and faster and faster and faster 
 And faster and faster and faster 
 And I cant live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I cant hide from the feelin cause its right 
 And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life 
 I cant live in a fairytale of lies 
 I can feel that you mesmerize my heart 
 I feel so free Im alive Im breakin out 
 I wont give in cause Im proud of all my scars 
 And I can see Ive been wastin too much time 
 A fairytale of liesWere gonna have a gothic christmas that is what well do 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas hope youll have one too 
 Santas going to wear a black vest just for me and you 
 Santas going to grunt in latin and slay a dragon or two 
 Rudolph he will change his name 
 Cause rudolph just sounds pretty lame 
 Now well call him Ragnagord the evil reindeer overlord 
 His nose it shall be red no more 
 It will be blackened to the core 
 His eyes will glow an evil glow to guide the chariot through the snow 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas that is what well do 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas hope you have one too 
 Hope youll have a gothic christmas tooMy hope is on fire 
 My dreams are for sale 
 I dance on a wire 
 I dont want to fail her 
 I walk against the stream 
 Fight for what I believe in 
 I run towards the end 
 Trying not to give in 
 Shes lost in the darkness fading away 
 Im still around here screaming her name 
 Shes haunting my dreamworld trying to survive 
 My heart is frozen Im losing my mind 
 Help me Im buried alive 
 Buried alive 
 Im burning the bridges 
 And theres no return 
 Im trying to reach her 
 I feel that she yearns 
 Im still around here screaming her name 
 I tried to revive whats already drowned 
 They think Im a fool who cant realize 
 Hope plays a wicked game with the mind 
 Cause I thought that love would bind 
 I cannot revive whats already drowned 
 She wont come around 
 Buried aliveIve been walking this road of desire 
 Ive been begging for blood on the wall 
 I dont care if Im playing with fire 
 Im aware that Im frozen inside 
 I have known all along 
 So much more going on no denying 
 But I know Im not standing alone 
 Youve been playing my mind through my wishes 
 You can feel that were haunting the truth 
 Dont know why cant hold on always losing control 
 In the middle of the night 
 I dont understand 
 Whats going on its a world gone astray 
 I cant let it end 
 So Ill keep searching in shadows 
 Your life it will never be in vain 
 No more tears no cause nothing else matters 
 Ive been closing my eyes for too long 
 Only vengeance will make me feel better 
 Theres no rest till I know that its done 
 Dont know I cant hold on always losing control 
 In the middle of the nightEvery finger in the room is pointing at me 
 I wanna spit in their faces then I get afraid what that could bring 
 I got a bowling ball in my stomach I got a desert in my mouth 
 Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now 
 Ive been looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets 
 Ive been raising up my hands drive another nail in 
 Just what God needs one more victim 
 Why do we crucify ourselves Well every day 
 I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you 
 I crucify myself every day 
 I crucify myself 
 And my heart is sick of being 
 I said my heart is sick of being 
 In chains oh chains oh 
 Got a kick for a dog beggin for love 
 I gotta have my suffering so that I can have my cross 
 I know a cat named Easter but he says Will you ever learn 
 Youre just an empty cage girl if you kill the bird 
 Got enough guilt to start my own religion 
 Why do we crucify ourselves Every day 
 My heart is sick of being 
 Please please please save me 
 I cry ah ah 
 Looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Where are those angels when you need them 
 Why do we oh chains 
 Why do we crucify ourselves 
 Crucify ourselves everyday 
 Oh chains oh why Yeah 
 Yeah chains oh oh oh oh oh 
 Never going back again oh 
 To crucify myself again you know 
 Never going back again 
 To crucify myself everydaySparkling angel I believed 
 You were my savior in my time of need 
 Blinded by faith I couldnt hear 
 All the whispers the warnings so clear 
 I see the angels Ill lead them to your door 
 Theres no escape now no mercy no more 
 No remorse cause I still remember 
 The smile when you tore me apart 
 You took my heart 
 Deceived me right from the start 
 You showed me dreams 
 I wished theyd turn into real 
 You broke a promise and made me realize 
 It was all just a lie 
 Sparkling angel I couldnt see 
 Your dark intentions your feelings for me 
 Fallen angel tell me why 
 What is the reason the thorn in your eye 
 No remorse cause I still remember 
 You broke the promise and made me realize 
 Could have been forever 
 Now we have reached the end 
 This world may have failed you 
 It doesnt give you a reason whyâ€” 
 You could have chosen a different path in life 
 I wished they turn into real 
 You broke the promise and made me realize 
 Now we have reached the endIll protect you from the hooded claw 
 Keep the vampires from your door 
 Ay ay ay ay 
 Feels like fire 
 Im so in love with you 
 Dreams are like angels 
 They keep bad at bay bad at bay 
 Love is the light 
 Scaring darkness away yeah 
 Purge the soul 
 Make love your goal 
 The power of love 
 A force from above 
 Cleaning my soul 
 Flame on burnt desire 
 Love with tongues of fire 
 Ill protect you from the hooded claw 
 When the chips are down Ill be around 
 With my undying deathdefying 
 Love for you 
 Envy will hurt itself 
 Let yourself be beautiful 
 Sparkling love flowers 
 And pearls and pretty girls 
 Love is like an energy 
 Rushin rushin inside of me 
 This time we go sublime 
 Lovers entwine divine divine 
 Love is danger love is pleasure 
 Love is pure the only treasure 
 A skyscraping dove 
 Keep the vampires from your doorIm searching for answer 
 Cause something is not right 
 I follow the signs 
 Im close to the fire 
 I fear that soon youll reveal 
 Your dangerous mind 
 Its in your eyes whats on your mind 
 I fear your smile and the promise inside 
 I fear your presence Im frozen inside 
 Im searching for answers 
 Not questioned before 
 The curse of awareness 
 Theres no peace of mind 
 As your true colours show 
 A dangerous sign 
 I see the truth that youve buried inside 
 Theres no mercy just anger I find 
 I just have to know while I still have time 
 Do I have to run or hide away from you 
 Theres no mercy just anger I findThe shadows of the night 
 Are unleashed again 
 Where their greed begins 
 The end is near 
 A morbid hunger for blood 
 Lies in their cold black eyes 
 Theyve come to take our lives away 
 One by one they died 
 A massacre that took all night 
 They had no chance it was no fight 
 You cant kill what has been killed before 
 They died 
 With shadows on its tale 
 He stepped through the portal 
 Locked the door and ate the key 
 With his life they took their way to freedom 
 And be became the final keeper of the keyIs it true what they say 
 Are we too blind to find the way 
 Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today 
 Come into my world 
 See through my eyes 
 Try to understand 
 Dont want to lose what we have 
 Weve been dreaming 
 But who can deny 
 Its the best way of living 
 Between the truth and the lies 
 See who I am 
 Break through the surface 
 Reach for my hand 
 Lets show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way 
 The world is in our hands 
 This is not the end 
 Fear is withering the soul 
 At the point of no return 
 We must be the change 
 We wish to see 
 Ill come into your world 
 See through your eyes 
 Ill try to understand 
 Before we lose what we have 
 We just cant stop believing 
 Cause we have to try 
 We can rise above 
 Their truth and their lies 
 I hear the silence 
 Preaching my blame 
 Will our strength remain 
 If their power reigns 
 See who I am 
 This is not the endThis is the end 
 Hold your breath and count to ten 
 Feel the earth move and then 
 Hear my heart burst again 
 For this is the end 
 Ive drowned and dreamt this moment 
 So overdue I owe them 
 Swept away Im stolen 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 At Skyfall 
 Skyfall is where we start 
 A thousand miles and poles apart 
 Where worlds collide and days are dark 
 You may have my number 
 You can take my name 
 But youll never have my heart 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 Where you go I go 
 What you see I see 
 I know Id never be me 
 Without the security 
 Of your loving arms 
 Keeping me from harm 
 Put your hand in my hand 
 And well stand 
 At SkyfallYoull burn this time 
 Seeing the violence 
 Its speeding my mind 
 No one is saving you 
 How can you find 
 A heaven in this hell 
 Leave it behind 
 Hearing your silence 
 It screams our goodbye 
 Cannot believe its an eye for an eye 
 Let us go to waste 
 Angels have faith 
 I dont want to be a part of his sin 
 I dont want to get lost in his world 
 Im not playing this game 
 When the shadows remain in the light of day 
 On the wings of darkness hell retaliate 
 Hell be fallen from grace 
 Until the end of all his days 
 From the ashes and hate 
 Its a cruel demons fate 
 On the wings of darkness hes returned to stay 
 There will be no escape 
 Cause hes fallen far from grace 
 What have you done 
 Is this what you wanted 
 What have you become 
 Your souls now forsaken 
 Youre walking alone 
 From heaven into hell 
 Now that you know 
 Your way in this madness 
 Your powers have grown 
 Your chains have been broken 
 You suffered so long 
 You will never change 
 Hell be falling from grace 
 Till the end of all his days 
 Cause hes fallen far from graceSay my name 
 So I will know youre back 
 Youre here again for a while 
 Oh let us share 
 The memories that only we can share 
 Together 
 Tell me about 
 The days before I was born 
 How we were as children 
 You touch my hand 
 These colors come alive 
 In your heart and in your mind 
 I cross the borders of time 
 Leaving today behind to be with you again 
 We breath the air 
 Do you remember how you used to touch my hair 
 Youre not aware 
 Your hands keep still 
 You just dont know that I am here 
 It hurts too much 
 I pray now that soon youll release 
 To where you belong 
 Please say my name 
 Remember who I am 
 You will find me in the world of yesterday 
 You drift away again 
 To far from where I am 
 When you ask me who I am 
 Say my name 
 Say my nameEasy come easy go thats just how you live 
 Oh take take take it all but you never give 
 Shouldve known you was trouble from the first kiss 
 Had your eyes wide open why were they open 
 Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
 You tossed it in the trash you did 
 To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
 Cause what you dont understand is 
 Id catch a grenade for ya 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
 Id jump in front of a train for ya 
 You know Id do anything for ya 
 Oh I would go through all this pain 
 Take a bullet straight through my brain 
 Yes I would die for you baby 
 But you wont do the same 
 No no no no 
 Black black black and blue beat me till Im numb 
 Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where youre from 
 Mad woman bad woman thats just what you are 
 Yeah youll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
 You tossed it in the trash yes you did 
 Yes I would die for ya baby 
 If my body was on fire 
 Ooh youd watch me burn down in flames 
 You said you loved me youre a liar 
 Cause you never ever ever did baby 
 But darling Id still catch a grenade for ya 
 No you wont do the same 
 You wouldnt do the same 
 Ooh you never do the same 
 No no no noOn behalf of her love 
 She no longer sleeps 
 Life had no longer meaning 
 Nothing to make her stay 
 She sold her soul away 
 I held you tight to me 
 You slipped away 
 You promised to return to me 
 And I believed 
 I believed 
 After the night he died 
 I wept my tears until they dried 
 But the pain stayed the same 
 I didnt want him to die all in vain 
 I made a promise to revenge his soul in time 
 Ill make them bleed down at my feet 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Could I have known about their true intentions 
 As the pain stayed the same 
 Im going to haunt them down all the way 
 One by one they were surprised 
 I believedI cant feel my senses 
 I just feel the cold 
 All colors seem to fade away 
 I cant reach my soul 
 I would stop running if I knew there was a chance 
 It tears me apart to sacrifice it all but Im forced to let go 
 Tell me Im frozen but what can I do 
 Cant tell the reasons I did it for you 
 When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you 
 You say that Im frozen but what can I do 
 I can feel your sorrow 
 You wont forgive me 
 But I know youll be all right 
 It tears me apart that you will never know but I have to let go 
 Everything will slip away 
 Shattered pieces will remain 
 When memories fade into emptiness 
 Only time will tell its tale 
 If it all has been in vain 
 I cant feel my senses 
 Frozen 
 But what can I do 
 Tell me Im frozen but what can I do 
 You say that Im frozen frozenIm working hard from dusk till dawn 
 Warm my body to the bone 
 This hard feeling wont leave me alone 
 Feels so cold oh bring me home 
 Its one of these days 
 Just one of these days 
 That blows us away 
 I walk this Earth 
 For what its worth 
 Fight like a lion to shake it off 
 Hunger I need to settle a score 
 With a ghost cant fight no more 
 In your footsteps I walk this Earth 
 That blows us awayOn golden wings 
 She flies at night 
 With her dress 
 Its blinding white 
 Countless diamonds 
 And her long blond hair 
 The queen is coming 
 So youd better be aware 
 Her plants and flowers 
 They are never the same 
 Blue and silver 
 Its all her game 
 Flying dragons 
 And enchanted woods 
 She decides she creates 
 Its her reality 
 In her world 
 Of dreams and make believe 
 She reigns forever 
 With all her glory 
 Unicorns appear in her sight 
 Her fireflies 
 Lead her trough these woods 
 At night 
 In search of the legendary amulet 
 And its secrets 
 In the big oak 
 There is a door 
 Wich will lead her 
 To the wizards shore 
 And shell ask him 
 For the wind to sail her home 
 To the world where she belongs 
 In this world 
 Of endless fantasy 
 She makes it happen 
 Its her realityI hear your whispers 
 Break the silence and it calms me down 
 Your taste on my lips 
 Your salty kisses 
 They say Im seeking out the danger 
 That one day you wont let me go 
 Ill drown youll take me down 
 I need you Aquarius 
 Enchanted I will have to stay 
 I feel you Aquarius 
 Cause you the sea set me free 
 You call to me Aquarius 
 You call to me you set me free 
 I relinquish to your powers 
 From your grasp I just cant hide 
 I missed the danger I had to conquer 
 You made me feel alive 
 They say I have to be aware 
 I long for you Aquarius 
 I need to be with you again 
 I fear you Aquarius 
 My destiny until the end 
 You call to me AquariusIs there a place deep within 
 A place where you hide youre darkest sins 
 Theres a strange kind of ambiance 
 Its surrounding you 
 As a songstress you lure me 
 Towards the truth 
 Candles die down as you leave the room 
 In my heart you leave no gloom 
 As you lure me I know the truth 
 Youre a leprechaun I see you through 
 Is there a place deep within 
 Towards the truthBlue eyes just smile to the world 
 Full of dreams and with fascination 
 Too soon she saw that her hands were chained and pulled without any freedom 
 Its always the same they fear no way out 
 I cannot break it 
 I can take it no more 
 Its burning me up inside 
 Lost all my tears cant cry 
 No reason no meaning 
 Just hatred 
 No matter how hard I try 
 You fear the beast inside 
 Its growing its waiting 
 Just to hurt you 
 This heart was hurt by the light and 
 I see your world that tries to deny us 
 Now everything that I love has died or has been shattered to pieces 
 Cant you see their eyes what lies inside 
 Theyve given up they no longer shine 
 Too soon they close with one last cry 
 Before they turn to light 
 Just to hurt youThe burnin desire to live and roam free 
 It shines in the dark and it grows within me 
 Youre holdin my hand but you dont understand 
 So where I am goin you wont be in the end 
 Im dreamin in colours of gettin the chance 
 Dreamin of tryin the the perfect romance 
 The search of the door to open your mind 
 In search of the cure of mankind 
 Help us were drownin 
 So close up inside 
 Why does it rain rain rain down on Utopia 
 Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are 
 How will the lights die down tellin us who we are 
 Im searchin for answers not given for free 
 Theyre hurtin inside as they lie within me 
 Youre takin the road all alone in the end 
 Im dreamin in colours no boundaries are there 
 Im dreamin the dream we all seem to share 
 In search of the door to open your mind 
 Why does it rainIve been around these vicious lives too too long to be neglecting the truth 
 Im getting closer and Im fully armed 
 Im about to hunt you down through the big black hole right behind you 
 And Im about to cut your wings away 
 Cause Ive been finding out where youve broken in 
 And I will take you out when I close you in 
 Im killing them all I put my soul on the line 
 I purify sins that I committed in life 
 Ill follow them all and Ill be bringing them down 
 Wherever they go Im right behind 
 Theres nowhere to go your head on the line 
 There is no rope youre running out of time 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soul 
 Im about to do it your way I will make your world unsafe 
 I never thought youd get this far its insane 
 You dont believe what all the signs say dont believe in judgment day 
 But you wont be leaving here unharmed 
 You can feel the pain and scream in vain 
 You sink away to the bottom 
 You cant break your chains break away from here 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soulSeven seconds till the rise 
 Cant believe Im still alive 
 And heaven was waiting for me 
 I thought this would be the end 
 But I know youll understand 
 All that is keeping me here 
 I dream of a stairway to the skies 
 My angel is coming down from heaven to take me 
 I reach out but then you fade away 
 Whenever you call for me 
 Know that Im only one step behind 
 My senses tell me I have changed 
 But one thing still remains 
 Im torn and the hates still aching 
 I slowly start to realize 
 We wont reunite 
 I still have to march on through 
 Is it a curse or a virtue 
 Have I been blinded by regret 
 Perdition awaits 
 My soul is at stake 
 Will I find a stairway to the skies 
 In the end 
 Know that Im only one step behindWhen leaves have fallen 
 And skies turned to grey 
 The night keeps on closing in on the day 
 A nightingale sings his song of farewell 
 You better hide for her freezing hell 
 On cold wings shes coming 
 You better keep moving 
 For warmth youll be longing 
 Come on just feel it 
 Dont you see it 
 You better believe 
 When she embraces 
 Your heart turns to stone 
 She comes at night when you are all alone 
 And when she whispers 
 Your blood shall run cold 
 You better hide before she finds you 
 Whenever she is raging 
 She takes life away 
 Havent you seen 
 The ruins of our world 
 She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak 
 The sun awakes and melts it away 
 The world now opens its eyes and it sees 
 The dawning of the new day 
 The ruins of our worldBirds and butterflies 
 Rivers and mountains she creates 
 But youll never know 
 The next move shell make 
 You can try 
 But it is useless to ask why 
 Cannot control her 
 She goes her own way 
 She rules 
 Until the end of time 
 She gives and she takes 
 She goes her way 
 With every breath 
 And all the choices that we make 
 We are only passing through 
 On her way 
 I find my strength 
 Believing that their soul lives on 
 Until the end of time 
 Ill carry it with me 
 Once you will know my dear 
 You dont have to fear 
 You dont have to fear 
 A new beginning 
 Always starts at the end 
 Until the end of time 
 She goes her way 
 She goes her wayIn the shadow awaits a desire that you know that you cant realize 
 And the pressure will just keep on rising now the heat is on 
 Its too late there is no way around it 
 You will see it in yourself many times 
 In the end you will give up to fight it unescapable 
 Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the lies 
 Where is the edge of your darkest emotions 
 Where does it all survive 
 Where is the light of your deepest devotions 
 I pray that its still alive 
 Its the rule that you live by and die for its the one thing you cannot deny 
 Even though you dont know what the price is it is justified 
 So much more that youve got left to fight for but it still doesnt change who you are 
 There is no fear youll ever give in to youre untouchable 
 Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the night 
 You cant stop yourself dont want to feel dont want to see what youve become 
 You cant walk away from who you are never give in 
 Where is the edge 
 I pray that its still aliveIt waits for the day I will let it out 
 To give it a reason to give it its might 
 I fear who I am becoming 
 I feel that Im losing the struggle within 
 I can no longer restrain it 
 My strength it is fading 
 I have to give in 
 Its the fear 
 Fear of the dark 
 Its growing inside of me 
 That one day will come to life 
 Have to save 
 To save my beloved 
 There is no escape 
 Because my fate is horror and doom 
 Hold down your head now 
 Just let me pass by 
 Dont feed my fear 
 If you dont want it out 
 I feel that Im losing all beauty within 
 I can no longer restrain it 
 Long ago it came to me 
 Im ever since that day 
 Infected with its rage 
 But it ends today 
 Because my fate is horror and doomIt doesnt hurt me 
 Do you wanna feel how it feels 
 Do you want to know know that it doesnt hurt me 
 Do you want to hear about the deal that Im making 
 You 
 Its you and me 
 And if I only could 
 Id make a deal with God 
 And Id get him to swap our places 
 Be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 Be running up that building 
 Say if I only could oh 
 You dont want to hurt me 
 But see how deep the bullet lies 
 Unaware Im tearing you asunder 
 Ooh there is thunder in our hearts 
 Is there so much hate for the ones we love 
 Tell me we both matter dont we 
 Its you and me wont be unhappy 
 Oh cmon baby 
 Oh cmon darling 
 Let me steal this moment from you now 
 Come on angel 
 Cmon cmon darling 
 Lets exchange the experience oh 
 Id be running up that road 
 With no problems 
 Say if I only could 
 If I only could 
 Be running up that hillI remember when 
 I remember I remember when I lost my mind 
 There was something so pleasant about that place 
 Even your emotions had an echo 
 In so much space 
 And when youre out there without care 
 Yeah I was out of touch 
 But it wasnt because I didnt know enough 
 I just knew too much mmm 
 Does that make me crazy 
 Possibly 
 And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
 But think twice 
 Thats my only advice mmm 
 Come on now who do you 
 Who do you who do you who do you think you are 
 Ha ha ha bless your soul 
 You really think youre in control 
 Well I think youre crazy 
 I think youre crazy 
 Just like me 
 My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
 And all I remember 
 Is thinking I want to be like them 
 Mmm ever since I was little 
 Ever since I was little it looked like fun 
 And its no coincidence Ive come 
 And I can die when Im done 
 But maybe Im crazy 
 Maybe youre crazy 
 Maybe were crazy 
 ProbablyWelcome to my home 
 The gates of time have opened 
 Now the chains are broken 
 An ancient force unleashed again 
 As I enter the portal 
 I feel the enchantment 
 It takes me away away from here 
 Come near me 
 Enter my private chambers 
 I want to feel the warmth on my face 
 Lightin darkness 
 Lift me up from here 
 Give me your wings 
 To flee from my ivory tower 
 The stars above are lying at my feet 
 To flee from my ivory towerNo one knows what its like 
 To be the bad man 
 To be the sad man 
 Behind blue eyes 
 No one knows what its like 
 To be hated 
 To be fated 
 To telling only lies 
 But my dreams they arent as empty 
 As my conscience seems to be 
 I have hours only lonely 
 My love is vengeance 
 Thats never free 
 To feel these feelings 
 Like I do 
 And I blame you 
 No one bites back as hard 
 On their anger 
 None of my pain and woe 
 Can show through 
 When my fist clenches crack it open 
 Before I use it and lose my cool 
 When I smile tell me some bad news 
 Before I laugh and act like a fool 
 And if I swallow anything evil 
 Put your finger down my throat 
 And if I shiver please give me a blanket 
 Keep me warm let me wear your coat 
 Behind blue eyesThere was a time I used to look into my fathers eyes 
 In a happy home I was a king I had a golden throne 
 Those days are gone now the memorys on the wall 
 I hear the songs from the places where I was born 
 Upon the hill across the blue lake 
 Thats where I had my first heartbreak 
 I still remember how it all changed 
 My father said 
 Dont you worry dont you worry child 
 See heavens got a plan for you 
 Dont you worry dont you worry now 
 Yeah 
 There was a time I met a girl of a different kind 
 We ruled the world I thought Id never lose her out of sight 
 We were so young I think of her now and then 
 I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend 
 Ohh 
 Ooh 
 YeahFor the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes 
 Wont repent to a mortal whom is all to blame 
 Now I know I wont make it 
 There will be a time well get back our freedom 
 They cant break whats inside 
 Ill face it cause its the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes 
 Save yourself from fading away now dont let it go 
 See what youve become dont sacrifice 
 Its truly the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes its the heart of everything 
 Stay with me now Im facing my last solemn hour 
 Very soon Ill embrace you on the other side 
 Hear the crowd in the distance screaming out my faith 
 Now their voices are fading I can feel no more pain 
 Its truly the heart of everythingIf I tell you 
 Will you listen 
 Will you stay 
 Will you be here forever 
 Never go away 
 Never thought things would change 
 Hold me tight 
 Please dont say again 
 That you have to go 
 A bitter thought 
 I had it all 
 But I just let it go 
 Oh this silence 
 Its so violent 
 Since yourre gone 
 All my thoughts are with you forever 
 Until the day well be back together 
 I will be waiting for you 
 If I had told you 
 You would have listened 
 You had stayed 
 You would be here forever 
 Never went away 
 It would never have been the same 
 All our time 
 Would have been in vain 
 Cause you had to go 
 The sweetest thought 
 Cause I did let you go 
 All our moments 
 Keep me warm 
 When youre gone 
 I will be waiting for youIm on a road of broken dreams 
 And I need to know why 
 Seek the truth through lies to be my guide 
 Im in a world of doubt and trust cant deny 
 I lost my way here in this quest cant lie 
 I cant believe whats happening 
 I dont know what to say 
 I cant believe Id live to see this day 
 I dont wanna live this way it haunts my mind 
 And I just need to get it straight stop wasting time 
 And I dont wanna live in fear but I cant change whats wrong 
 But I know wont be living in a lie 
 Oh Ill be hanging on the cross 
 When I put the nails in 
 Its time to choose a road that we believe in 
 You say you understand it all try and smile 
 If only I could see its true somehow 
 And what I wouldnt give to change our fate 
 And I dont wanna live in fear but I can change whats wrong 
 And Ive tried so hard to hold on 
 But I keep on falling 
 And no matter how hard I run 
 I just keep returning 
 And Im back to where I started from 
 I dont wanna live this way it haunts my mind 
 And I just need to get it straight stop wasting time 
 But I know wont be living in a lieYour back against the wall 
 Take or leave it all 
 Only this lifetime 
 Is it worth it all 
 Run or take the fall 
 Only this lifetime with me 
 With arms open wide 
 Just living on fire 
 I leaned out my hand 
 Its all that I can 
 Theres nothing I hide 
 Living on fire fire 
 Feel it all 
 With arms wide open 
 Fire fire 
 Your back against the wall 
 With arms wide openWhere are the heroes in my time of need 
 Is my cry not loud enough or have they gone all numb 
 They just tend to stand out of the rain 
 Thinking but not acting that theyre not to blame 
 Falling and crawling 
 A fight to stand up 
 Memory still haunts me 
 In the dead of night 
 Over and over 
 I felt so small 
 But one day Ill be stronger 
 And youd better watch out 
 I will overcome 
 Your violence their silence 
 Although it cant be undone 
 I will overcome 
 Knowing that Im not the only one 
 I will overcome 
 Its the only way to carry on 
 Where are the saviours afraid of the toll 
 Sorry do my nine inch nails slash your soul 
 Such heroes throwing stones 
 Straight at the one who is standing alone 
 Twisting and turning 
 Its always the same 
 Truth is never honest 
 When youre to blame 
 Pushing and pulling 
 I never give in 
 But one day I wish youll see 
 Youre not so beautiful within 
 Your violence your silence 
 Although 
 It cant be undone 
 Knowing that Im not the only one 
 Its the only way to carry on 
 Run and run 
 Their violence your silence 
 I will overcomeDetermined by your faith you attempt to make up 
 You lay out your case like the enemy 
 But all that you got through dirty white lies 
 Youll find the damn correct way of blaming me for your crimes 
 Wont you talk to me 
 Dont walk or run away 
 Im onto you yesterday 
 With empty eyes 
 I dont know where Im going 
 In search for answers 
 I dont know who Im fighting 
 I stand with empty eyes 
 Youre like the ghost within me 
 Whos draining my life 
 Its like my soul is see through 
 Right through my empty eyes 
 Right through my empty eyes 
 Im about to give in I got nowhere to go 
 Afraid of the sins Im holding on 
 Theres no other way no doubt in the end 
 But I aint got a thing to lose nothing to defend 
 Ooh please wont you give in to me 
 Wont you finally speak truthfully 
 Determined by your faith you attempt to make up 
 You lay out your case like the enemy like the enemy 
 Right through my empty eyesTheres no sense the fire burns 
 When wisdom fails it changes all 
 The wheel embodies all that keeps on turnin 
 Blood red skies I feel so cold 
 No innocence we play our role 
 The wheel embodies all where are we goin 
 All in all youd expect the wise to be wiser 
 Fallen from grace and 
 All and all I guess we should have known better cause 
 What about us Isnt it enough 
 No were not in paradise 
 This is who we are this is what weve got 
 No its not our paradise 
 But its all we want and its all that were fightin for 
 Though its not paradise 
 You and us or I and them 
 There comes a time to take a stand 
 The wheel is watchin all that keeps on burnin 
 The venom works its like a curse 
 A Trojan horse when will we learn 
 The wheel embodies all that keeps returnin 
 But its not paradise 
 What about us What about us 
 What about us Isnt it enoughEvery word youre saying is a lie 
 Run away my dear 
 But every sign will say your heart is deaf 
 Bury all the memories 
 Cover them with dirt 
 Wheres the love we once had 
 Our destinys unsure 
 Why cant you see what we had 
 Let the fire burn the ice 
 Is it all a lie 
 And I still wonder 
 Why our heaven has died 
 The skies are all falling 
 Im breathing but why 
 In silence I hold on 
 To you and I 
 Closer to insanity 
 Buries me alive 
 Wheres the life we once had 
 It cannot be denied 
 You run away 
 You hide away 
 To the other side of the universe 
 Where youre safe from all that hunts you down 
 But the world is gone 
 Where you belong 
 And it feels too late so youre moving on 
 But can you find your way back home 
 Every word youre saying is a lieWeve been seein what you wanted 
 Got us cornered right now 
 Fallen asleep from our vanity 
 Might cost us our lives 
 I hear theyre gettin closer 
 Their howls are sendin chills down my spine 
 And time is runnin out now 
 Theyre comin down the hills from behind 
 When we start killin 
 Its all comin down right now 
 From the nightmare weve created 
 I want to be awakened somehow 
 I want to be awakened right now 
 It all will be fallin down 
 From the hell that were in 
 All we are is fadin away 
 Weve been searchin all night long 
 But theres no trace to be found 
 Its like they all have just vanished 
 But I know theyre around 
 I feel theyre gettin closer 
 The sun is risin the screams have gone 
 Too many have fallen few still stand tall 
 Is this the endin of what weve begun 
 Will we remember what weve done wrong 
 When we start killinCannot swallow the soil make it all beautiful 
 Cannot carry you carry you carry you now 
 The truth cant bear the sunlight youre afraid for the day it does 
 And when I told you so 
 I got burned burned burned again 
 Heaven forbid that my heart is for sale 
 Hope in the end truth prevails 
 Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world 
 Feel that Im gonna get home if I try 
 Need to find my way home home 
 Youre as proud as a god 
 But I believed in your heart 
 And Ill be leaving you leaving you leaving you now 
 The truth cant bear the sunlight 
 And dont pretend to be my guide 
 You said youd change it all but I got burned burned burned instead 
 Heaven can wait cause my soul aint for sale 
 Justify 
 No more lies 
 Once upon a timeI feel my heart explode to particles 
 Love is always here and I told you so 
 Restless in dreams love carved in stone 
 This rhapsody of life in a way 
 I guess we all know it 
 Hand in hand we stand while we watch it flow 
 Heaven can you help us No we cant go 
 Covered by roses 
 When this dance is over 
 We all know our beauty will die 
 The choirs have awoken 
 Left no words unspoken 
 Remember you as long as I can 
 Hold you in my arms all night 
 And spill the wine until the end 
 We all have our place in time 
 Need to live every moment 
 We built our castles high turned our dreams to gold 
 We took the blows with pride went through it all 
 The dawn is closing in new tales are told 
 I guess we all know 
 For all we are is falling stars in the night 
 A blinding light raging down from the sky 
 The rise and fall the rhapsody of our lives 
 So we all let go we gotta let go 
 She dwells with beauty beauty that must die 
 And joy whose hand is ever at his lips 
 His soul shall taste the sadness of her might 
 And be among her butty trophies hung 
 Covered by covered by 
 Need to live every momentIve been dreaming for so long 
 To find a meaning to understand 
 The secret of life 
 Why am I here to try again 
 Will I always will you always 
 See the truth when it stares you in the face 
 Will I ever will I never free myself 
 By breaking these chains 
 Id give my heart give my soul 
 Id turn it back its my fault 
 Your destiny is forlorn 
 Have to live till its undone 
 Id turn it back and then at last Ill be on my way 
 Ive been living for so long 
 Many seasons passed me by 
 Ive seen kingdoms through ages 
 Rise and fall Ive seen it all 
 Seen the horror seen the wonders 
 Happening just in front of my eyes 
 Will I ever will I never free myself by making it right 
 Jillian our dream ended long ago 
 All our stories and all our glory I held so dear 
 We wont be together 
 For ever and ever no more tears 
 Ill always be here til the end 
 Jillian no more tears 
 Id turn it back and then at last Ill be on my wayTake away 
 These hands of darkness 
 Reaching for my soul 
 Now the cold wind 
 Blows out my candles 
 Feeling 
 Only fear 
 Without any hope 
 A thousand dark moons 
 A thousand winters long 
 A million fallen stars 
 The candle burns in the womb 
 We try not to forget 
 They live through us 
 Slowly they die away at every candles end 
 A thousand dark moons 
 The candle burns in the womb 
 They live through us 
 Slowly they die away at every candles endYou live your life 
 You go day by day 
 Like nothing can go wrong 
 Then scars are made 
 Theyre changing the game 
 You learn to play it hard 
 And I know you wish for more 
 And I know you try 
 And I hope you realize 
 You know the time is right 
 The whole world is watching when you rise 
 The whole world is beating for you right now 
 Your whole life is flashing for your eyes 
 Its all in this moment that changes all 
 What are you waiting for 
 What are you fighting for 
 Cause times always slipping away 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah the whole world is watching you when you rise 
 You build your walls 
 And break them away 
 Cause that is what it takes 
 Youve saved yourself 
 Youve found who you are 
 That never goes away 
 Cause times always slipping away 
 Your sacrifice goes through your mind 
 But nothing is wasted 
 Youve made it now 
 Youll rise again 
 Breaking out 
 Each step that youve taken 
 Youve paid the price 
 Yeah the whole world is watching you when you riseThe child without a name grew up to be the hand 
 To watch you to shield you or kill on demand 
 The choice hed made he could not comprehend 
 His blood a grim secret they had to command 
 Hes torn between his honor and the true love of his life 
 He prayed for both but was denied 
 So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed 
 Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind 
 So many years have past who are the noble and the wise 
 Will all our sins be justified 
 The curse of his powers tormented his life 
 Obeying the crown was a sinister price 
 His soul was tortured by love and by pain 
 He surely would flee but the oath made him stay 
 Please forgive me for the sorrow for leaving you in fear 
 For the dreams we had to silence thats all theyll ever be 
 Still Ill be the hand that serves you 
 Though youll not see that it is me 
 Will all our sins be justifiedI know I wont change I have tried 
 Was feelin so caged hands tied 
 I cant find anything feelin so right 
 Its blindin hope 
 The Reaper is close seen his smile 
 A matter of time cant deny 
 I wont turn around round round 
 This destinys mine 
 The countdown has begun 
 The walls are fallin down 
 My life is on the line 
 The freedom is mine 
 Its dangerous to sacrifice 
 It makes your blood run to throw the dice 
 Its dangerous its what you like 
 Its what youll die for to live this life 
 Were goin on and well never stop 
 Were goin on till our worlds collide 
 Its dangerous so dangerous dangerous 
 I know its not safe close my eyes 
 I search for the edge of life 
 Cause thats the only place Ill ever find 
 That makes me whole 
 A thief in the night out of sight 
 Its out there waiting to ignite 
 The fever will rise rise rise 
 Taking over my mind 
 Countdown has begun 
 Walls are fallin down 
 Life is on the line 
 Nothing matters anyhow its like Im floating off the ground 
 Into the hands of air I dive rays of light flashing by 
 Like the time is slowin down when the world is out of sight 
 All the memories in my mind wont leave me behind 
 Its dangerous 
 Dangerous 
 Its dangerous its what youre like 
 So dangerous 
 DangerousThe darkness has come to the roses 
 The fire is reaching the air 
 The colours that I have created 
 Are suddenly flying away 
 Im not fighting myself will not follow 
 Cause my choices are mine its my fate 
 And Ill never bow down from the sorrow 
 Ill face all that is coming my way 
 The lying the devil the silence 
 Embracing the world on the edge 
 Let us burn 
 The night in the skies here tonight 
 In this fire that makes us yearn 
 Were fighting our fear of the silence 
 Were running through walls where they stand 
 Im searching no more for tomorrow 
 I reach for the skies while I can 
 The unknown will always be waiting 
 My last day Ill jump in its hands 
 Why why dont you let me burn 
 Why dont you come down 
 And break out and let me burn 
 Oh why why dont you let me burn 
 Why dont you let me burn 
 Oh why 
 Chasing the demons in my mind 
 Oh why me 
 Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground 
 The darkness has come to the roses 
 And the fire is reaching the air 
 Let us burnTurn around open your eyes 
 Cant move on the fear is tyin you down 
 Open your eyes 
 Its alright 
 Oh 
 Im hellbound in this life 
 Keep fightin this endless war 
 Its always been like this 
 I dont know why 
 Enslavement of your mind 
 Your fear it ties me down 
 Goin down I wont bow 
 No 
 Screamin at the walls of fire 
 They are closing in on me 
 Closing in on me 
 Im hungry for the burnin of the silver moonlight 
 Its where I wanna be 
 Where I wanna be 
 But Im still runnin free 
 Im still runnin free 
 In the silver moonlight 
 I cant breathe 
 I cant breathe 
 These days are lonely now 
 Breathin in the coldest lies 
 I think thats only what you have in mind 
 Holdin on to the best of you 
 I hit the pavement 
 Down 
 Ive been patient 
 But its colors that I need 
 Too many shades of gray 
 I cannot breathe 
 The dreams I havent tainted 
 Need you to believe 
 The only way to make them real 
 Oh 
 I cant breath 
 Turn around open your eyes 
 Its alrightGive me strength to face the truth the doubt within my soul 
 No longer I can justify the bloodshed in His name 
 Is it a sin to seek the truth the truth beneath the rose 
 Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heavens door 
 I believed it would justify the means 
 It had a hold over me 
 Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast 
 It is the darker side of me 
 Forgive me my sins 
 The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen 
 Forgive me for what I have been 
 Forgive me my sins 
 Pray for me cause I have lost my faith in holy wars 
 Is paradise denied to me cause I cant take no more 
 Has darkness taken over me consumed my mortal soul 
 All my virtues sacrificed can Heaven be so cruel 
 Im hoping Im praying 
 I wont get lost between two worlds 
 For all I have seen the truth lies in between 
 Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done 
 Now that I know the darkest side of me 
 How can blood be our salvation 
 And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times 
 Will I learn whats truly sacred 
 Will I redeem my soul 
 Will truth set me free 
 Et est signum dies datus et tenebris 
 Mea culpa acta est fabula pereoThe world seems not the same 
 Though I know nothing has changed 
 Its all my state of mind 
 I cant leave it all behind 
 I have to stand up to be stronger 
 I have to try to break free 
 From the thoughts in my mind 
 Use the time that I have 
 I cant say goodbye 
 Have to make it right 
 Have to fight cause I know 
 In the end its worthwhile 
 That the pain that I feel slowly fades away 
 It will be all right 
 I know should realise 
 Time is precious it is worthwhile 
 Despite how I feel inside 
 Have to trust it will be all right 
 Have to stand up to be stronger 
 Oh this night is too long 
 I have no strength to go on 
 No more pain Im floating away 
 Through the mist I see the face 
 Of an angel who calls my name 
 I remember youre the reason I have to stay 
 It will be all rightCouldnt save you from the start 
 Love you so it hurts my soul 
 Can you forgive me for trying again 
 Your silence makes me hold my breath 
 Time has passed you by 
 Oh for so long Ive tried to shield you from the world 
 Oh you couldnt face the freedom on your own 
 Here I am left in silence 
 You gave up the fight 
 You left me behind 
 All thats dones forgiven 
 Youll always be mine 
 I know deep inside 
 I watched the clouds drifting away 
 Still the sun cant warm my face 
 I know it was destined to go wrong 
 You were looking for the great escape 
 To chase your demons away 
 And here I am left in silence 
 Ive been so lost since youve gone 
 Why not me before you 
 Why did fate deceive me 
 Everything turned out so wrong 
 Why did you leave me in silence 
 All thats dones forgivenShe sang for you last night she heard you were calling 
 Yearning in tears a thousand times 
 Your spirit was floating your spirit was searching 
 On a cloud of dreams 
 A moon beam shines bright in the city of angels 
 Guiding the dreamers back to life 
 And theyll do the same every tomorrow 
 Till the pain subsides 
 Dont be scared now 
 Close your eyes 
 She holds guard tonight 
 Go on forward 
 No remorse 
 Life will take its course 
 She danced with you last night so you will remember 
 All you have shared the lifetime 
 The angels were watching and death will be waiting 
 Until the time is right 
 Hold on to memories 
 See what lies ahead 
 Life will go on and we are one 
 With every step you takeOver the hills lies a new beginning 
 Over the hills 
 Over the hills there is a way I know it 
 You cant bring all the gloom 
 Your heart is frayed and so empty 
 You glorify the future 
 Living in a different world than me 
 The journey ends in death 
 You are giving up so easily 
 You are the other half of me 
 We are drifting apart 
 Chilled to the marrow cause you dont want to go 
 Cause weve got a different wish at heart 
 The amulet guides us to the other side 
 When I go down its you wholl bleed 
 Im not scared to die as long as Im with you 
 Over the hills lies a new beginning 
 Over the hillsThe turn against 
 The world we know 
 Now our destiny 
 Will be decided 
 We have to send our brothers in arms 
 With pain in our heart 
 We watched them go 
 Will they return 
 Truth is we had no choice 
 Well try to shield those we can 
 No better world 
 Let this end 
 Mothers cry 
 Our boys die 
 But well stand till the endShes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer 
 Nother day nother night 
 And she acting like she dont sleep 
 Shes a five when she drinks 
 But shes a ten when shes on top of him 
 She dont want love she just wanna touch 
 Shes a greedy girl to never get enough 
 She dont wanna love she just wanna touch 
 Shes got all the moves that make you get it up 
 Shes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer 
 Never ever lonely 
 Youll never be her only 
 Its a game that she plays 
 She can win with her eyes closed 
 Its insane how she tames 
 She can turn you to an animal 
 Shes got all the moves that make you give it up 
 The girl dont stop 
 Dirty dancer 
 The girl dont stopAfter the cold darkness 
 In the heart of the forest 
 Where birds are singing 
 For the new born sun 
 In the womb of the leaves 
 On the branches of the trees 
 Lies the treasure of the morning 
 The Pearls of Light 
 Carried away by the truculence of my world 
 I got lost in the search for enlightenment 
 The blue rain covered my roots 
 And I forgot where I came from 
 And I forgot where I came fromWe can be friends 
 Of course we can 
 Sorry did my nineinch nails cut your soul 
 Such a hero throwing stones 
 To the one that really stands here all alone 
 Crawling and crawling 
 Cant get up 
 All these years of silence 
 But I wont give up 
 See you suffer 
 Holding me down 
 One day I will be somebody 
 Youd better watch out 
 I will overcome 
 In violence your silence can never be undone 
 Maybe in the second round 
 We can be friends 
 Run and run 
 In silence your violence can never be undone 
 RunI know youre going away 
 I take my love into another day 
 In my thoughts youre with me 
 I fell in love with your ways 
 I know youre going away 
 Lead my heart into a daze 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soul 
 Wherever you are 
 Whatever you do 
 I feel the walls surrounding you 
 I know you are independent 
 But Im trying to get through to you 
 Dont you know it depends on you 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soulWeve been dreaming for so long 
 Endless wisdom comes our way 
 And before he his time has 
 Never failing until the end 
 Well always well always 
 See the truthless skies in your face 
 Well never well never 
 See the love when having goodbye 
 If you want to belong 
 And never see youre facing 
 To feel the sorrow 
 And never see the truth 
 Its too long to belong 
 And never see your face 
 And never to be strong 
 Weve been dreaming for so long 
 Can his words taken you way 
 Never faling until the end 
 For how long 
 The dream has sinned long ago 
 We tell our stories and endless worries found in here 
 Well be together for ever and ever 
 Found in here 
 Well always be 
 And never to be strongIn a world so far away 
 At the end of a closing day 
 A little child was born and raised 
 Deep in the forest on a hidden place 
 Mother never saw his face 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 The woods protected fulfilled his needs 
 Fruit by birds honey by bees 
 He found shelter under the trees 
 He grew up in their company 
 They became his family 
 A thousand seasons 
 They passed him by 
 So many times have said goodbye 
 And when the spirits called out his name 
 To join forever forever to stay 
 A forest spirit he became 
 In perfect harmonyFor so long Ive tried 
 Could not close my eyes 
 When you became an outcast in this life 
 Again and again I try 
 To understand the demons inside your head 
 But the truth is 
 You love them to death 
 Now I know its the last time I have tried 
 To lift you up to make you fight 
 Nothing is ever easy in life 
 I cant change it if you dont 
 Have the will deep inside 
 I have been blind to 
 How you justify 
 Everything that youve wasted in this life 
 Got lost in the illusion 
 Id find a solution for the demons in your head 
 You can blame and you can hide 
 Behind what is wrong and what is right 
 Life is the choices we make 
 I hope youll awake before its too late 
 Have the will deep insideI did my best to please you 
 But my best was never good enough 
 Somehow youre only able to see 
 All I am not 
 Did you ever look behind 
 Arent you afraid of the pieces youll find 
 I have failed you 
 But you have failed me too 
 Its so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if its justified 
 The ones you do not understand 
 In your life why didnt you ever try 
 I close my eyes as I walk 
 The thin line between love and hate 
 For the person with the same blood 
 In his veins 
 You show no regrets 
 About all the things you did or said 
 But believe me you failed me too 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if its justified 
 Do you ever wonder if its justifiedIn my hands 
 A legacy of memories 
 I can hear you say my name 
 I can almost see your smile 
 Feel the warmth of your embrace 
 But there is nothing but silence now 
 Around the one I loved 
 Is this our farewell 
 Sweet darling 
 You worry too much my child 
 See the sadness in your eyes 
 You are not alone in life 
 Although you might think that you are 
 Never thought 
 This day would come so soon 
 We had no time to say goodbye 
 How can the world just carry on 
 I feel so lost when you are not by my side 
 So sorry your world is tumbling down 
 I will watch you through these nights 
 Rest your head and go to sleep 
 Because my child 
 This is not our farewell 
 This is not our farewellHe feeds on fear 
 He feeds on pain 
 He rules again 
 With growing hate 
 He will gain 
 Their faith again 
 No light in the darkness 
 Is too small to see 
 Theres always a sparkle of hope 
 If you just believe 
 He told the tale so many times 
 About the dream not meant to be 
 In a world of the free 
 Plays with your mind 
 As faith for the future faded fast 
 He grows strong with their displeasure 
 It sets him free 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 He feeds on fear 
 Poisons the truth 
 To gain their faith 
 To lead the way 
 To a world of decay 
 Rules your heart 
 Hell sell your soul to the grave 
 Without a hesitation to make 
 He belongs to the dark 
 Please awake 
 And see the truth 
 He can only be 
 If you believe what he tells you 
 Remember who you are 
 What you stand for 
 And there will always be a way 
 In my heart there is a place 
 In my heart there is a trace 
 Of a small fire burning 
 A sheltering ray shines through this night 
 Although its small its bright 
 But darkness is lurking 
 He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold 
 Oh fear him 
 Shall he rule againIve been left out alone like a damn criminal 
 Ive been praying for help cause I cant take it all 
 Im not done its not over 
 Now Im fighting this war since the day of the fall 
 And Im desperately holding onto it all 
 But Im lost Im so damn lost 
 Oh I wish it was over and I wish you were here 
 Still Im hoping that somehow 
 Cause your soul is on fire a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart 
 I breathe underwater its all in my hands 
 But what can I do Dont let it fall apart 
 A shot in the dark 
 In the blink of an eye I can see through your eyes 
 As Im lying awake Im still hearing the cries 
 And it hurts hurts me so bad 
 And Im wondering why I still fight in this life 
 Cause Ive lost all my faith in this damned bitter strife 
 And its sad its so damn sad 
 I feel you fading away 
 Oh your soul is on fire a shot in the dark 
 A shot in the darkWhy you just wont leave my mind 
 Was this the only way 
 I couldnt let you stay 
 Run away hide away 
 The secrets in your mind 
 Sacrificed just her life 
 For a higher love 
 No matter how many stones you put inside 
 Shell always keeps on floating in your mind 
 With every turn of your head you see her face again 
 Until the end over and over again 
 Why you just wont leave my mind 
 Told the truth she laughed at you 
 Something snapped inside 
 She had to go or they would know 
 All you tried to hide 
 The sins of your life are now catching up with you 
 You cant stay ahead Theres nothing you can do 
 I couldnt let you stay 
 Spoken by Mother Maiden 
  
 Some may call it a curse 
 A life like mine 
 But others a blessing 
 Its certainly a lonely life 
 But a fulfilling one at best 
 Its my cross to bear 
 And I bear it gladly 
 Someone has to take a stand against evil 
 Why should it not be meSomeone is dancing 
 On my grave 
 Sending shivers 
 Down my spine 
 I hear a laugh 
 It awoke my soul 
 The wind takes the leaves 
 Where he wants them to go 
 His tunes enchant our world 
 Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
 In this heart of mine 
 Its you I find 
 Take my hand 
 Ill take you to the promised land 
 Youre the one 
 It awoke my soul 
 His tunes enchant our world 
 Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
 Ill take you to the promised land 
 Nevil whatever you have done 
 These tears will fade 
 Nevil wherever you have gone 
 Please have faithIm holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the ground 
 And Im hearing what you say 
 But I just cant make a sound 
 You tell me that you need me 
 Then you go and cut me down but wait 
 You tell me that youre sorry 
 Didnt think Id turn around and say 
 That its too late to apologize its too late 
 I said its too late to apologize its too late 
 Id take another chance 
 Take a fall take a shot for you 
 And I need you like a heart needs a beat 
 But its nothing new yeah 
 I loved you with a fire red 
 Now its turning blue and you say 
 Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you 
 But Im afraid 
 Its too late to apologize its too late 
 Im holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the groundThese are the darkest clouds 
 They have surrounded me 
 Now I find my self alone caught in a cage 
 Theres no flower I can find in here 
 Not withering 
 Not pale to me 
 Everyone with a friendly face 
 Seems to hide some secret inside 
 He told me he loved me 
 While he laughed in my face 
 He just led me astray 
 He took my virtue 
 I feel so cold inside 
 Sorrow has frozen my mind 
 My heart is covered 
 With thoughts entangled 
 How could it ever have felt so real 
 Is there a place more lonely than I feel within 
 Could I have seen 
 Could I have known 
 I just took it as the truth 
 Always there to remind me 
 It keeps me from believing 
 That someone might be there 
 Wholl free me and never ever leave meIve been losin myself in anger 
 So much broken by the rage 
 Nothin could take my mind off 
 How to make them pay 
 Killin myself for nothin 
 And the pain wont go away 
 Losin myself to madness 
 And the games been played 
 If I could turn 
 The hands of time I would 
 But here I am 
 Tell me why am I still here when its all gone 
 Im livin with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still tryin to hold on 
 Ive got to tear it down to let it go 
 Im too tired to keep on tryin 
 But Im spellbound till the end 
 Knowin that theres no closure 
 For my wars inside 
 Ive buried the good and evil 
 Only memories left behind 
 I am the one still standin 
 I will live to tell 
 Here I am 
 Tell me why Im wastin away 
 Wastin away 
 Tell me how to break my own chains 
 Break my own chains 
 Cause Im losin after all 
 How can I escape this grim fate 
 Escape this grim fate 
 Tell me how to face one more day 
 Face one more day 
 Cause Im wastin away 
 Its all gone silent 
 Im searchin for fire 
 Nothin to fight for alone 
 Ive got to tear it down to let it goWhy was I one of the chosen ones 
 Until the fight I could not see 
 The magic and the strength of my power 
 It was beyond my wildest dreams 
 Dark wings they are descending 
 See shadows gathering around 
 One by one they are falling 
 Every time they try to strike us down 
 Dont you die on me 
 You havent made your peace 
 Live a life breathe breathe 
 As they took your soul away 
 The night turned into the day 
 Blinded by your rays of life 
 Gave us the strength we needed 
 Every time they try to strike us 
 Every time they try to strike us downShe embraced with a smile 
 As she opened the door 
 A cold wind blows 
 It puts a chill 
 Into her heart 
 You have taken away the trust 
 Youre the ghost haunting through her heart 
 Past and present are one in her head 
 Take my hand as I wander through 
 All of my life I gave to you 
 All of my love I gave to you 
 Lai lai lai la lai lai lai la lai lai lai lai lai la lai lai lai 
 Lai lai lai la lai 
 La la la lai 
 Lai la la 
 Lai lai lai 
 Lai lai laiNow the day has come 
 We are forsaken this time 
 We lived our lives in our paradise 
 As gods we shaped the world around 
 No borderlines wed stay behind 
 Though balance is something fragile 
 While we thought we were gaining 
 Wed turn back the tide it still slips away 
 Our time has run out our future has died 
 Theres no more escape 
 Now the day has come 
 We are forsaken 
 Theres no time anymore 
 Life will pass us by 
 Were the last of our kind 
 The sacrifice was much too high 
 Our greed just made us all go blind 
 We tried to hide what we feared inside 
 Today is the end of tomorrow 
 As the sea started rising 
 The land that we conquered just washed away 
 Although we all have tried to turn back the tide 
 It was all in vain 
 Only ruins stay behind 
 Now the day has come 
 The day has come 
 The day has comeIm waking up to ash and dust 
 I wipe my brow and sweat my rust 
 Im breathing in the chemicals 
 Im breaking in and shaping up 
 Then checking out on the prison bus 
 This is it the apocalypse whoa 
 Im waking up I feel it in my bones 
 Enough to make my system blow 
 Welcome to the new age to the new age 
 Whoa oh Whoa Im radioactive radioactive 
 I raise my flag dye my clothes 
 Its a revolution I suppose 
 Were painted red to fit right in whoa 
 All systems go the sun hasnt died 
 Deep in my bones straight from inside 
 Whoa oh Whoa Im radioactive radioactiveNothings ever changed you still turn away 
 Youve washed your hands youve made that all too clear 
 You just keep on living this lie 
 You refuse to see youre denying me 
 The cross I bear but you dont seem to care 
 Even Judas knew he had lied 
 I keep wondering why 
 Im still calling your name through my tears 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear 
 Cold is your silence denying what is real 
 Im still wondering why 
 Im still calling your name my dear 
 Im sorry if you cant stand the naked truth 
 All you see is how you want it to be 
 So you keep on living your life 
 Release me from this cross after all these years 
 Oh call my name and help me with this weight 
 Even though it comes far too late 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear 
 Im still wondering why Im still calling your name 
 And I wonder oh I wonder  
 In my heart I still hope you will open the door 
 You can purify it all answer my call 
 Why Why 
 You can purify it all answer my callI escaped my final moment 
 But its turning back at me 
 On every corner I can feel it waiting 
 Just a moment no awareness 
 I could easily slip away 
 And then Ill be gone forever 
 Im searching 
 Im fighting for a way to get through 
 To turn it away 
 Its waiting always trying 
 I feel the hands of fate theyre suffocating 
 Tell me whats the reason 
 Is it all inside my head 
 Cant take it no more 
 All around me I see danger 
 And its closing in on me 
 Every second I can hear it breathing 
 I cant stand the fear inside me 
 Cause its leading me astray 
 And it will be my ending 
 Im searching 
 But no one faced whats coming my way 
 And I will let my fear fade away 
 Whatever may be Ill have to find out 
 Cant take it no moreCold are the bones of thy soldiers 
 Longing for home their little paradise 
 I dont feel redemption on their side 
 Fallen from grace help me rise again 
 Fallen from grace help me through 
 Fallen from grace 
 Feel these hands the pressure the cold tremble 
 Do you hear these words 
 Do you feel the wounds 
 Ill never help you through 
 Cold are thy souls 
 I feel the resentment 
 They feel betrayed 
 They hate the cold 
 Fallen from grace help me throughI can see 
 When you stay low 
 Nothing happens 
 Does it feel right 
 Late at night 
 Things I thought Id put behind me 
 Haunt my mind 
 I just know theres no escape now 
 Once it sets its eyes on you 
 But I wont run 
 Have to stare it in the eyes 
 Stand my ground 
 I wont give in 
 No more denying 
 Ive gotta face it 
 Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I dont make it someone else will 
 Its all around 
 Getting stronger coming closer into my world 
 I can feel that its time for me to face it 
 Can I take it 
 Though this might just be the ending 
 Of the life I held so dear 
 Theres no turning back from here 
 All I know for sure is that Im trying 
 I will always stand my ground 
 I wont give in I wont give in 
 I wont give up I wont give up 
 No more denying Ahhhhh 
 Stand my groundKiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby you the best 
 I got my red dress on tonight 
 Dancin in the dark in the pale moonlight 
 Done my hair up real big beauty queen style 
 High heels off Im feelin alive 
 Oh my God I feel it in the air 
 Telephone wires above 
 Are sizzlin like a snare 
 Honey Im on fire I feel it everywhere 
 Nothin scares me anymore 
 One two three four 
 Kiss me hard before you go 
 I got that summertime summertime sadness 
 Sususummertime summertime sadness

 Im feelin electric tonight 
 Cruisin down the coast goin about 99 
 Got my bad baby by my heavenly side 
 I know if I go Ill die happy tonight 
 Think Ill miss you forever 
 Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky 
 Laters better than never 
 Even if youre gone Im gonna drive 
 Got that summertime summertime sadnessIt burns into your heart the darkness that you fear 
 You were never free and you never realized 
 And love is a word youve never heard 
 Your heart aint cold cause it burns a desire to leave the mire 
 Take your breath till nothings left 
 Scars of life upon your chest 
 And I know wherever it goes 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin love 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Yeah we run runnin in the dark 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 Dont blink youll miss it lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone yeah we outta here 
 Too late we gone yeah we outta here 
 And we long for a heavenly heart 
 Imma break these chains ran through the rain 
 Never looked back never quit work through the pain 
 This blood in my veins run cold when I think 
 Itll never be the same but I never lose hope 
 This is my time now no time for tears to celebrate 
 Put it in the air right now never back down 
 You can never wear my crown cause it weighs too much 
 And I crush every motherfuckin thing I touch 
 This is love Ive never loved so much 
 Get involved make the world stand up 
 Give my life before I ever give up 
 Name in lights you lost all my trust 
 Now its time to face all of us 
 Get in line cause theyre callin us 
 And it feels so marvelous 
 Just take my hand and run 
 Yeah we outta here 
 Too late we gone yeah we outta hereWake up in the dead of night 
 Dogs are turning wild 
 Run into whats wrong each time 
 Fail to get it right 
 Fighting off this heavy heart 
 Keeping your head high 
 Oh wont you please forget 
 Wont you please forget 
 These are the dog days 
 Leading our hearts astray 
 Soon they will fade away 
 1 2 3 4 
 Awakened by the dreams at night 
 Chills run down your spine 
 The brightest star in summer skies 
 Brings madness to our minds 
 Fighting off the darkest thoughts 
 Fighting to survive 
 These are the dog days 
 Embracing the highs to fight the lows 
 Running down the path that I think I need to go 
 When you think youve won youre still losing after all 
 These are the dog daysLost in the darkness 
 Hoping for a sign 
 Instead there is only silence 
 Cant you hear my screams 
 Never stop hoping 
 Need to know where you are 
 But one thing is for sure 
 Youre always in my heart 
 Ill find you somewhere 
 Ill keep on trying until my dying day 
 I just need to know whatever has happened 
 The truth will free my soul 
 Lost in the darkness try to find your way home 
 I want to embrace you and never let you go 
 Almost hope youre in heaven so no one can hurt your soul 
 Living in agony cause I just do not know where you are 
 Wherever you are 
 I wont stop searching 
 Whatever it takes 
 I need to know 
 The truth will free my soulArmies have conquered 
 And fallen in the end 
 Kingdoms have risen 
 Then buried by sand 
 The Earth is our mother 
 She gives and she takes 
 She puts us to sleep 
 In her light well awake 
 Well all be forgotten 
 Theres no endless fame 
 But everything we do 
 Its never in vain 
 Were part of a story part of a tale 
 Were all on this journey 
 No one is to stay 
 Where ever its going 
 What is the way 
 Forests and deserts 
 Rivers blue seas 
 Mountains and valleys 
 Nothing here stays 
 While we think we witness 
 We are part of the scene 
 This neverending story 
 Where will it lead to 
 The earth is our mother 
 But shes also a part 
 A part of the tale 
 No ones to stay 
 Oh where is it going 
 Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane 
 No one remembers how it began 
 No one remembers how it beganYou shout it out 
 But I cant hear a word you say 
 Talking loud 
 Not saying much 
 Criticize 
 But all your bullets ricochet 
 Shoot me down 
 But I get up 
 Im bulletproof 
 Nothing to lose 
 Fire away fire away 
 Ricochet 
 You take your aim 
 You shoot me down 
 But I wont fall 
 I am titanium 
 Cut me down 
 But its you wholl have further to fall 
 Ghost town 
 Haunted love 
 Raise your voice 
 Sticks and stones may break my bones 
 Stone heart 
 Machine gun 
 Firing at the ones who run 
 Loves bulletproof glass 
 I am titaniumIm dying to catch my breath 
 Oh why dont I ever learn 
 Ive lost all my trust 
 Though Ive surely tried to turn it around 
 Can you still see the heart of me 
 All my agony fades away 
 When you hold me in your embrace 
 Dont tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Give me something I can believe 
 Dont tear me down 
 Youve opened the door now dont let it close 
 Im here on the edge again 
 I wish I could let it go 
 I know that Im only one step away 
 From turning it around 
 Dont tear it down whats left of me 
 I tried many times but nothing was real 
 Make it fade away dont break me down 
 I want to believe that this is for real 
 Save me from my fear 
 Make my heart a better placeWould you mind if I hurt you 
 Understand that I need to 
 Wish that I had other choices 
 Than to harm the one I love 
 What have you done now 
 I know I better stop tryin 
 You know that theres no denyin 
 I wont show mercy on you now 
 I know I should stop believin 
 I know that theres no retrievin 
 Its over now what have you done 
 I have been waitin for someone like you 
 But now you are slippin away oh 
 What have you done now 
 Why why does fate make us suffer 
 Theres a curse between us between me and you 
 Would you mind if I killed you 
 Would you mind if I tried to 
 Cause you have turned into my worst enemy 
 You carry hate that I dont feel 
 What have you done what have you done 
 I will not fall wont let it go 
 We will be free when it ends 
 Theres a curse between us between me and youYour call is coming 
 Im dreaming away 
 For what lies hidden 
 It needs to be found 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found 
 They will lead us to tomorrow 
 Voices forgotten 
 I hear them close by 
 Ghosts from the past I can see through their eyes 
 Are these the ancestors leaving me signs 
 The sounds they are all around 
 Forces start moving out 
 Taking sides though theres so much 
 That I need to know 
 And soon it will be shown 
 When the ghosts are found they will lead us to tomorrow 
 If we could restart how it was before tomorrowLeft in the darkness 
 Here on your own 
 Woke up a memory 
 Feeding the pain 
 You cannot deny it 
 Theres nothing to say 
 Its all that you need to fire away 
 Oh damn the war is coming 
 Oh damn you feel you want it 
 Oh damn just bring it on today 
 You cant live without the fire 
 Its the heat that makes you strong 
 Cause youre born to live and fight it all the way 
 You cant hide what lies inside you 
 Its the only thing you know 
 Youll embrace it and never walk away 
 Dont walk away 
 Raised in this madness 
 Youre on your own 
 It makes you fearless 
 Dreams are a drug here 
 They get in your way 
 Thats what what you need to fight day by day 
  
 You need not fear us 
 Unless you are a Darkheart 
 A vile one who preys on the innocent 
 I promise 
 You cant hide forever from the empty darkness 
 For we will hunt you down like the animals you are 
 And pull you into the very bowels of Hell 
 Dont walk awayWell you only need the light when its burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know youve been high when youre feeling low 
 Only hate the road when youre missin home 
 And you let her go 
 Staring at the bottom of your glass 
 Hoping one day youll make a dream last 
 But dreams come slow and they go so fast 
 You see her when you close your eyes 
 Maybe one day youll understand why 
 Everything you touch surely dies 
 But you only need the light when its burning low 
 Staring at the ceiling in the dark 
 Same old empty feeling in your heart 
 Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast 
 Well you see her when you fall asleep 
 But never to touch and never to keep 
 Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep 
 Well you only need the light when its burning low 
 Well you let her go 
 Cause you only need the light when its burning low 
 And you let her goIve got to try its not over yet 
 No signals of life have you left 
 My heart is bleeding just for you 
 Bleeds for only 
 And it hurts to know the truth 
 Are you looking for savior 
 Chasing a dream 
 Love turned to hate 
 Now Im crossing the border 
 Sealing our fate 
 But Im not afraid 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 Im telling you you will like it I know 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad its the first time 
 Only you can set it free 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad come break away with me 
 This second chance I know wont last 
 Buts OK got no regrets 
 And I I feel the end near Im no fool 
 Getting closer 
 But Im doing what I should 
 Ive been drowning in sorrow 
 Chasing tomorrow running away 
 Now youre crossing the borders 
 Sealing tomorrow but youre not afraid 
 Im telling you you will like it 
 Im telling you you will like it I know Wohoho 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad come break away with meO deus eicie 
 Mortatis animus solum est 
 Letalis animus concidamus unis 
 Osstendo malum osstendo lux 
 Anima mortatis eternum est 
 Anima irrata belli somnium 
 Anima quiesa evitae somnium 
 Anima mortatis eternum sunt 
 Osstendo malumIn this world you tried 
 Not leaving me alone behind 
 Theres no other way 
 I prayed to the gods let him stay 
 The memories ease the pain inside 
 Now I know why 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 In silent moments 
 Imagine youd be here 
 Your silent whispers silent tears 
 Made me promise Id try 
 To find my way back in this life 
 I hope there is a way 
 To give me a sign youre okay 
 Reminds me again its worth it all 
 So I can go home 
 Together in all these memories 
 I see your smile 
 All the memories I hold dear 
 Darling you know Ill love you 
 Til the end of time 
 All of my memoriesI speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country of our empire of our allies and above all of the cause of Freedom 
 Sanctus Espiritus Redeem us from our solemn hour 
 Sanctus Espiritus Insanity is all around us 
 Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus 
 In my darkest hours I could not foresee 
 That the tide could turn so fast to this degree 
 Cant believe my eyes how can you be so blind 
 Is the heart of stone no empathy inside 
 Time keeps on slipping away and we havent learned 
 So in the end now what have we gained 
 Sanctus Espiritus Is this what we deserve 
 Can we break free from chains of neverending agony 
 Are they themselves to blame the misery the pain 
 Didnt we let go allowed it let it grow 
 If we cant restrain the beast which dwells inside 
 it will find its way somehow somewhere in time 
 Will we remember all of the suffering Cause if we fail it will be in vain 
 A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armoured tanks have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line and strong columns of their armoured vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day or two was without defenders They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track 
 Sanctus Espiritus Redeem us from our solemn hour Our solemn hour 
 Sanctus Espiritus Insanity is all around us All around us 
 Can we break free from chains of neverending agonyWinter has come for me cant carry on 
 The chains to my life are strong but soon theyll be gone 
 Ill spread my wings one more time 
 Is it a dream 
 All the ones Ive loved calling out my name 
 The sun warms my face 
 All the days of my life I see them passing me by 
 In my heart I know I can let go 
 In the end I will find some peace inside 
 New wings are growing tonight 
 As I am soaring Im one with the wind 
 I am longing to see you again its been so long 
 We will be together again 
 All the days of my life I see them passing me byI cant sleep cause its burnin deep inside 
 Like gasoline on fire runnin wild 
 No more fear cause Im gettin closer now 
 So unreal but I like it anyhow 
 I go faster and faster and faster and faster 
 And faster and faster and faster 
 And I cant live in a fairytale of lies 
 And I cant hide from the feelin cause its right 
 And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life 
 I cant live in a fairytale of lies 
 I can feel that you mesmerize my heart 
 I feel so free Im alive Im breakin out 
 I wont give in cause Im proud of all my scars 
 And I can see Ive been wastin too much time 
 A fairytale of liesWere gonna have a gothic christmas that is what well do 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas hope youll have one too 
 Santas going to wear a black vest just for me and you 
 Santas going to grunt in latin and slay a dragon or two 
 Rudolph he will change his name 
 Cause rudolph just sounds pretty lame 
 Now well call him Ragnagord the evil reindeer overlord 
 His nose it shall be red no more 
 It will be blackened to the core 
 His eyes will glow an evil glow to guide the chariot through the snow 
 We want to wish you a gothic christmas 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas that is what well do 
 Were gonna have a gothic christmas hope you have one too 
 Hope youll have a gothic christmas tooMy hope is on fire 
 My dreams are for sale 
 I dance on a wire 
 I dont want to fail her 
 I walk against the stream 
 Fight for what I believe in 
 I run towards the end 
 Trying not to give in 
 Shes lost in the darkness fading away 
 Im still around here screaming her name 
 Shes haunting my dreamworld trying to survive 
 My heart is frozen Im losing my mind 
 Help me Im buried alive 
 Buried alive 
 Im burning the bridges 
 And theres no return 
 Im trying to reach her 
 I feel that she yearns 
 Im still around here screaming her name 
 I tried to revive whats already drowned 
 They think Im a fool who cant realize 
 Hope plays a wicked game with the mind 
 Cause I thought that love would bind 
 I cannot revive whats already drowned 
 She wont come around 
 Buried aliveIve been walking this road of desire 
 Ive been begging for blood on the wall 
 I dont care if Im playing with fire 
 Im aware that Im frozen inside 
 I have known all along 
 So much more going on no denying 
 But I know Im not standing alone 
 Youve been playing my mind through my wishes 
 You can feel that were haunting the truth 
 Dont know why cant hold on always losing control 
 In the middle of the night 
 I dont understand 
 Whats going on its a world gone astray 
 I cant let it end 
 So Ill keep searching in shadows 
 Your life it will never be in vain 
 No more tears no cause nothing else matters 
 Ive been closing my eyes for too long 
 Only vengeance will make me feel better 
 Theres no rest till I know that its done 
 Dont know I cant hold on always losing control 
 In the middle of the nightEvery finger in the room is pointing at me 
 I wanna spit in their faces then I get afraid what that could bring 
 I got a bowling ball in my stomach I got a desert in my mouth 
 Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now 
 Ive been looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets 
 Ive been raising up my hands drive another nail in 
 Just what God needs one more victim 
 Why do we crucify ourselves Well every day 
 I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you 
 I crucify myself every day 
 I crucify myself 
 And my heart is sick of being 
 I said my heart is sick of being 
 In chains oh chains oh 
 Got a kick for a dog beggin for love 
 I gotta have my suffering so that I can have my cross 
 I know a cat named Easter but he says Will you ever learn 
 Youre just an empty cage girl if you kill the bird 
 Got enough guilt to start my own religion 
 Why do we crucify ourselves Every day 
 My heart is sick of being 
 Please please please save me 
 I cry ah ah 
 Looking for a savior in these dirty streets 
 Where are those angels when you need them 
 Why do we oh chains 
 Why do we crucify ourselves 
 Crucify ourselves everyday 
 Oh chains oh why Yeah 
 Yeah chains oh oh oh oh oh 
 Never going back again oh 
 To crucify myself again you know 
 Never going back again 
 To crucify myself everydaySparkling angel I believed 
 You were my savior in my time of need 
 Blinded by faith I couldnt hear 
 All the whispers the warnings so clear 
 I see the angels Ill lead them to your door 
 Theres no escape now no mercy no more 
 No remorse cause I still remember 
 The smile when you tore me apart 
 You took my heart 
 Deceived me right from the start 
 You showed me dreams 
 I wished theyd turn into real 
 You broke a promise and made me realize 
 It was all just a lie 
 Sparkling angel I couldnt see 
 Your dark intentions your feelings for me 
 Fallen angel tell me why 
 What is the reason the thorn in your eye 
 No remorse cause I still remember 
 You broke the promise and made me realize 
 Could have been forever 
 Now we have reached the end 
 This world may have failed you 
 It doesnt give you a reason whyâ€” 
 You could have chosen a different path in life 
 I wished they turn into real 
 You broke the promise and made me realize 
 Now we have reached the endIll protect you from the hooded claw 
 Keep the vampires from your door 
 Ay ay ay ay 
 Feels like fire 
 Im so in love with you 
 Dreams are like angels 
 They keep bad at bay bad at bay 
 Love is the light 
 Scaring darkness away yeah 
 Purge the soul 
 Make love your goal 
 The power of love 
 A force from above 
 Cleaning my soul 
 Flame on burnt desire 
 Love with tongues of fire 
 Ill protect you from the hooded claw 
 When the chips are down Ill be around 
 With my undying deathdefying 
 Love for you 
 Envy will hurt itself 
 Let yourself be beautiful 
 Sparkling love flowers 
 And pearls and pretty girls 
 Love is like an energy 
 Rushin rushin inside of me 
 This time we go sublime 
 Lovers entwine divine divine 
 Love is danger love is pleasure 
 Love is pure the only treasure 
 A skyscraping dove 
 Keep the vampires from your doorIm searching for answer 
 Cause something is not right 
 I follow the signs 
 Im close to the fire 
 I fear that soon youll reveal 
 Your dangerous mind 
 Its in your eyes whats on your mind 
 I fear your smile and the promise inside 
 I fear your presence Im frozen inside 
 Im searching for answers 
 Not questioned before 
 The curse of awareness 
 Theres no peace of mind 
 As your true colours show 
 A dangerous sign 
 I see the truth that youve buried inside 
 Theres no mercy just anger I find 
 I just have to know while I still have time 
 Do I have to run or hide away from you 
 Theres no mercy just anger I findThe shadows of the night 
 Are unleashed again 
 Where their greed begins 
 The end is near 
 A morbid hunger for blood 
 Lies in their cold black eyes 
 Theyve come to take our lives away 
 One by one they died 
 A massacre that took all night 
 They had no chance it was no fight 
 You cant kill what has been killed before 
 They died 
 With shadows on its tale 
 He stepped through the portal 
 Locked the door and ate the key 
 With his life they took their way to freedom 
 And be became the final keeper of the keyIs it true what they say 
 Are we too blind to find the way 
 Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today 
 Come into my world 
 See through my eyes 
 Try to understand 
 Dont want to lose what we have 
 Weve been dreaming 
 But who can deny 
 Its the best way of living 
 Between the truth and the lies 
 See who I am 
 Break through the surface 
 Reach for my hand 
 Lets show them that we can 
 Free our mind and find a way 
 The world is in our hands 
 This is not the end 
 Fear is withering the soul 
 At the point of no return 
 We must be the change 
 We wish to see 
 Ill come into your world 
 See through your eyes 
 Ill try to understand 
 Before we lose what we have 
 We just cant stop believing 
 Cause we have to try 
 We can rise above 
 Their truth and their lies 
 I hear the silence 
 Preaching my blame 
 Will our strength remain 
 If their power reigns 
 See who I am 
 This is not the endThis is the end 
 Hold your breath and count to ten 
 Feel the earth move and then 
 Hear my heart burst again 
 For this is the end 
 Ive drowned and dreamt this moment 
 So overdue I owe them 
 Swept away Im stolen 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 And face it all together 
 At Skyfall 
 Skyfall is where we start 
 A thousand miles and poles apart 
 Where worlds collide and days are dark 
 You may have my number 
 You can take my name 
 But youll never have my heart 
 Let the sky fall 
 When it crumbles 
 We will stand tall 
 Where you go I go 
 What you see I see 
 I know Id never be me 
 Without the security 
 Of your loving arms 
 Keeping me from harm 
 Put your hand in my hand 
 And well stand 
 At SkyfallYoull burn this time 
 Seeing the violence 
 Its speeding my mind 
 No one is saving you 
 How can you find 
 A heaven in this hell 
 Leave it behind 
 Hearing your silence 
 It screams our goodbye 
 Cannot believe its an eye for an eye 
 Let us go to waste 
 Angels have faith 
 I dont want to be a part of his sin 
 I dont want to get lost in his world 
 Im not playing this game 
 When the shadows remain in the light of day 
 On the wings of darkness hell retaliate 
 Hell be fallen from grace 
 Until the end of all his days 
 From the ashes and hate 
 Its a cruel demons fate 
 On the wings of darkness hes returned to stay 
 There will be no escape 
 Cause hes fallen far from grace 
 What have you done 
 Is this what you wanted 
 What have you become 
 Your souls now forsaken 
 Youre walking alone 
 From heaven into hell 
 Now that you know 
 Your way in this madness 
 Your powers have grown 
 Your chains have been broken 
 You suffered so long 
 You will never change 
 Hell be falling from grace 
 Till the end of all his days 
 Cause hes fallen far from graceSay my name 
 So I will know youre back 
 Youre here again for a while 
 Oh let us share 
 The memories that only we can share 
 Together 
 Tell me about 
 The days before I was born 
 How we were as children 
 You touch my hand 
 These colors come alive 
 In your heart and in your mind 
 I cross the borders of time 
 Leaving today behind to be with you again 
 We breath the air 
 Do you remember how you used to touch my hair 
 Youre not aware 
 Your hands keep still 
 You just dont know that I am here 
 It hurts too much 
 I pray now that soon youll release 
 To where you belong 
 Please say my name 
 Remember who I am 
 You will find me in the world of yesterday 
 You drift away again 
 To far from where I am 
 When you ask me who I am 
 Say my name 
 Say my nameEasy come easy go thats just how you live 
 Oh take take take it all but you never give 
 Shouldve known you was trouble from the first kiss 
 Had your eyes wide open why were they open 
 Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
 You tossed it in the trash you did 
 To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
 Cause what you dont understand is 
 Id catch a grenade for ya 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
 Id jump in front of a train for ya 
 You know Id do anything for ya 
 Oh I would go through all this pain 
 Take a bullet straight through my brain 
 Yes I would die for you baby 
 But you wont do the same 
 No no no no 
 Black black black and blue beat me till Im numb 
 Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where youre from 
 Mad woman bad woman thats just what you are 
 Yeah youll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
 You tossed it in the trash yes you did 
 Yes I would die for ya baby 
 If my body was on fire 
 Ooh youd watch me burn down in flames 
 You said you loved me youre a liar 
 Cause you never ever ever did baby 
 But darling Id still catch a grenade for ya 
 No you wont do the same 
 You wouldnt do the same 
 Ooh you never do the same 
 No no no noOn behalf of her love 
 She no longer sleeps 
 Life had no longer meaning 
 Nothing to make her stay 
 She sold her soul away 
 I held you tight to me 
 You slipped away 
 You promised to return to me 
 And I believed 
 I believed 
 After the night he died 
 I wept my tears until they dried 
 But the pain stayed the same 
 I didnt want him to die all in vain 
 I made a promise to revenge his soul in time 
 Ill make them bleed down at my feet 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Could I have known about their true intentions 
 As the pain stayed the same 
 Im going to haunt them down all the way 
 One by one they were surprised 
 I believedI cant feel my senses 
 I just feel the cold 
 All colors seem to fade away 
 I cant reach my soul 
 I would stop running if I knew there was a chance 
 It tears me apart to sacrifice it all but Im forced to let go 
 Tell me Im frozen but what can I do 
 Cant tell the reasons I did it for you 
 When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you 
 You say that Im frozen but what can I do 
 I can feel your sorrow 
 You wont forgive me 
 But I know youll be all right 
 It tears me apart that you will never know but I have to let go 
 Everything will slip away 
 Shattered pieces will remain 
 When memories fade into emptiness 
 Only time will tell its tale 
 If it all has been in vain 
 I cant feel my senses 
 Frozen 
 But what can I do 
 Tell me Im frozen but what can I do 
 You say that Im frozen frozenIm working hard from dusk till dawn 
 Warm my body to the bone 
 This hard feeling wont leave me alone 
 Feels so cold oh bring me home 
 Its one of these days 
 Just one of these days 
 That blows us away 
 I walk this Earth 
 For what its worth 
 Fight like a lion to shake it off 
 Hunger I need to settle a score 
 With a ghost cant fight no more 
 In your footsteps I walk this Earth 
 That blows us awayOn golden wings 
 She flies at night 
 With her dress 
 Its blinding white 
 Countless diamonds 
 And her long blond hair 
 The queen is coming 
 So youd better be aware 
 Her plants and flowers 
 They are never the same 
 Blue and silver 
 Its all her game 
 Flying dragons 
 And enchanted woods 
 She decides she creates 
 Its her reality 
 In her world 
 Of dreams and make believe 
 She reigns forever 
 With all her glory 
 Unicorns appear in her sight 
 Her fireflies 
 Lead her trough these woods 
 At night 
 In search of the legendary amulet 
 And its secrets 
 In the big oak 
 There is a door 
 Wich will lead her 
 To the wizards shore 
 And shell ask him 
 For the wind to sail her home 
 To the world where she belongs 
 In this world 
 Of endless fantasy 
 She makes it happen 
 Its her realityI hear your whispers 
 Break the silence and it calms me down 
 Your taste on my lips 
 Your salty kisses 
 They say Im seeking out the danger 
 That one day you wont let me go 
 Ill drown youll take me down 
 I need you Aquarius 
 Enchanted I will have to stay 
 I feel you Aquarius 
 Cause you the sea set me free 
 You call to me Aquarius 
 You call to me you set me free 
 I relinquish to your powers 
 From your grasp I just cant hide 
 I missed the danger I had to conquer 
 You made me feel alive 
 They say I have to be aware 
 I long for you Aquarius 
 I need to be with you again 
 I fear you Aquarius 
 My destiny until the end 
 You call to me AquariusIs there a place deep within 
 A place where you hide youre darkest sins 
 Theres a strange kind of ambiance 
 Its surrounding you 
 As a songstress you lure me 
 Towards the truth 
 Candles die down as you leave the room 
 In my heart you leave no gloom 
 As you lure me I know the truth 
 Youre a leprechaun I see you through 
 Is there a place deep within 
 Towards the truthBlue eyes just smile to the world 
 Full of dreams and with fascination 
 Too soon she saw that her hands were chained and pulled without any freedom 
 Its always the same they fear no way out 
 I cannot break it 
 I can take it no more 
 Its burning me up inside 
 Lost all my tears cant cry 
 No reason no meaning 
 Just hatred 
 No matter how hard I try 
 You fear the beast inside 
 Its growing its waiting 
 Just to hurt you 
 This heart was hurt by the light and 
 I see your world that tries to deny us 
 Now everything that I love has died or has been shattered to pieces 
 Cant you see their eyes what lies inside 
 Theyve given up they no longer shine 
 Too soon they close with one last cry 
 Before they turn to light 
 Just to hurt youThe burnin desire to live and roam free 
 It shines in the dark and it grows within me 
 Youre holdin my hand but you dont understand 
 So where I am goin you wont be in the end 
 Im dreamin in colours of gettin the chance 
 Dreamin of tryin the the perfect romance 
 The search of the door to open your mind 
 In search of the cure of mankind 
 Help us were drownin 
 So close up inside 
 Why does it rain rain rain down on Utopia 
 Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are 
 How will the lights die down tellin us who we are 
 Im searchin for answers not given for free 
 Theyre hurtin inside as they lie within me 
 Youre takin the road all alone in the end 
 Im dreamin in colours no boundaries are there 
 Im dreamin the dream we all seem to share 
 In search of the door to open your mind 
 Why does it rainIve been around these vicious lives too too long to be neglecting the truth 
 Im getting closer and Im fully armed 
 Im about to hunt you down through the big black hole right behind you 
 And Im about to cut your wings away 
 Cause Ive been finding out where youve broken in 
 And I will take you out when I close you in 
 Im killing them all I put my soul on the line 
 I purify sins that I committed in life 
 Ill follow them all and Ill be bringing them down 
 Wherever they go Im right behind 
 Theres nowhere to go your head on the line 
 There is no rope youre running out of time 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soul 
 Im about to do it your way I will make your world unsafe 
 I never thought youd get this far its insane 
 You dont believe what all the signs say dont believe in judgment day 
 But you wont be leaving here unharmed 
 You can feel the pain and scream in vain 
 You sink away to the bottom 
 You cant break your chains break away from here 
 So where will you go when I will murder your soulSeven seconds till the rise 
 Cant believe Im still alive 
 And heaven was waiting for me 
 I thought this would be the end 
 But I know youll understand 
 All that is keeping me here 
 I dream of a stairway to the skies 
 My angel is coming down from heaven to take me 
 I reach out but then you fade away 
 Whenever you call for me 
 Know that Im only one step behind 
 My senses tell me I have changed 
 But one thing still remains 
 Im torn and the hates still aching 
 I slowly start to realize 
 We wont reunite 
 I still have to march on through 
 Is it a curse or a virtue 
 Have I been blinded by regret 
 Perdition awaits 
 My soul is at stake 
 Will I find a stairway to the skies 
 In the end 
 Know that Im only one step behindWhen leaves have fallen 
 And skies turned to grey 
 The night keeps on closing in on the day 
 A nightingale sings his song of farewell 
 You better hide for her freezing hell 
 On cold wings shes coming 
 You better keep moving 
 For warmth youll be longing 
 Come on just feel it 
 Dont you see it 
 You better believe 
 When she embraces 
 Your heart turns to stone 
 She comes at night when you are all alone 
 And when she whispers 
 Your blood shall run cold 
 You better hide before she finds you 
 Whenever she is raging 
 She takes life away 
 Havent you seen 
 The ruins of our world 
 She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak 
 The sun awakes and melts it away 
 The world now opens its eyes and it sees 
 The dawning of the new day 
 The ruins of our worldBirds and butterflies 
 Rivers and mountains she creates 
 But youll never know 
 The next move shell make 
 You can try 
 But it is useless to ask why 
 Cannot control her 
 She goes her own way 
 She rules 
 Until the end of time 
 She gives and she takes 
 She goes her way 
 With every breath 
 And all the choices that we make 
 We are only passing through 
 On her way 
 I find my strength 
 Believing that their soul lives on 
 Until the end of time 
 Ill carry it with me 
 Once you will know my dear 
 You dont have to fear 
 You dont have to fear 
 A new beginning 
 Always starts at the end 
 Until the end of time 
 She goes her way 
 She goes her wayIn the shadow awaits a desire that you know that you cant realize 
 And the pressure will just keep on rising now the heat is on 
 Its too late there is no way around it 
 You will see it in yourself many times 
 In the end you will give up to fight it unescapable 
 Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the lies 
 Where is the edge of your darkest emotions 
 Where does it all survive 
 Where is the light of your deepest devotions 
 I pray that its still alive 
 Its the rule that you live by and die for its the one thing you cannot deny 
 Even though you dont know what the price is it is justified 
 So much more that youve got left to fight for but it still doesnt change who you are 
 There is no fear youll ever give in to youre untouchable 
 Cause youre losing your mind and you sleep in the heart of the night 
 You cant stop yourself dont want to feel dont want to see what youve become 
 You cant walk away from who you are never give in 
 Where is the edge 
 I pray that its still aliveIt waits for the day I will let it out 
 To give it a reason to give it its might 
 I fear who I am becoming 
 I feel that Im losing the struggle within 
 I can no longer restrain it 
 My strength it is fading 
 I have to give in 
 Its the fear 
 Fear of the dark 
 Its growing inside of me 
 That one day will come to life 
 Have to save 
 To save my beloved 
 There is no escape 
 Because my fate is horror and doom 
 Hold down your head now 
 Just let me pass by 
 Dont feed my fear 
 If you dont want it out 
 I feel that Im losing all beauty within 
 I can no longer restrain it 
 Long ago it came to me 
 Im ever since that day 
 Infected with its rage 
 But it ends today 
 Because my fate is horror and doomIt doesnt hurt me 
 Do you wanna feel how it feels 
 Do you want to know know that it doesnt hurt me 
 Do you want to hear about the deal that Im making 
 You 
 Its you and me 
 And if I only could 
 Id make a deal with God 
 And Id get him to swap our places 
 Be running up that road 
 Be running up that hill 
 Be running up that building 
 Say if I only could oh 
 You dont want to hurt me 
 But see how deep the bullet lies 
 Unaware Im tearing you asunder 
 Ooh there is thunder in our hearts 
 Is there so much hate for the ones we love 
 Tell me we both matter dont we 
 Its you and me wont be unhappy 
 Oh cmon baby 
 Oh cmon darling 
 Let me steal this moment from you now 
 Come on angel 
 Cmon cmon darling 
 Lets exchange the experience oh 
 Id be running up that road 
 With no problems 
 Say if I only could 
 If I only could 
 Be running up that hillI remember when 
 I remember I remember when I lost my mind 
 There was something so pleasant about that place 
 Even your emotions had an echo 
 In so much space 
 And when youre out there without care 
 Yeah I was out of touch 
 But it wasnt because I didnt know enough 
 I just knew too much mmm 
 Does that make me crazy 
 Possibly 
 And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
 But think twice 
 Thats my only advice mmm 
 Come on now who do you 
 Who do you who do you who do you think you are 
 Ha ha ha bless your soul 
 You really think youre in control 
 Well I think youre crazy 
 I think youre crazy 
 Just like me 
 My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
 And all I remember 
 Is thinking I want to be like them 
 Mmm ever since I was little 
 Ever since I was little it looked like fun 
 And its no coincidence Ive come 
 And I can die when Im done 
 But maybe Im crazy 
 Maybe youre crazy 
 Maybe were crazy 
 ProbablyWelcome to my home 
 The gates of time have opened 
 Now the chains are broken 
 An ancient force unleashed again 
 As I enter the portal 
 I feel the enchantment 
 It takes me away away from here 
 Come near me 
 Enter my private chambers 
 I want to feel the warmth on my face 
 Lightin darkness 
 Lift me up from here 
 Give me your wings 
 To flee from my ivory tower 
 The stars above are lying at my feet 
 To flee from my ivory towerNo one knows what its like 
 To be the bad man 
 To be the sad man 
 Behind blue eyes 
 No one knows what its like 
 To be hated 
 To be fated 
 To telling only lies 
 But my dreams they arent as empty 
 As my conscience seems to be 
 I have hours only lonely 
 My love is vengeance 
 Thats never free 
 To feel these feelings 
 Like I do 
 And I blame you 
 No one bites back as hard 
 On their anger 
 None of my pain and woe 
 Can show through 
 When my fist clenches crack it open 
 Before I use it and lose my cool 
 When I smile tell me some bad news 
 Before I laugh and act like a fool 
 And if I swallow anything evil 
 Put your finger down my throat 
 And if I shiver please give me a blanket 
 Keep me warm let me wear your coat 
 Behind blue eyesThere was a time I used to look into my fathers eyes 
 In a happy home I was a king I had a golden throne 
 Those days are gone now the memorys on the wall 
 I hear the songs from the places where I was born 
 Upon the hill across the blue lake 
 Thats where I had my first heartbreak 
 I still remember how it all changed 
 My father said 
 Dont you worry dont you worry child 
 See heavens got a plan for you 
 Dont you worry dont you worry now 
 Yeah 
 There was a time I met a girl of a different kind 
 We ruled the world I thought Id never lose her out of sight 
 We were so young I think of her now and then 
 I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend 
 Ohh 
 Ooh 
 YeahFor the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes 
 Wont repent to a mortal whom is all to blame 
 Now I know I wont make it 
 There will be a time well get back our freedom 
 They cant break whats inside 
 Ill face it cause its the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes 
 Save yourself from fading away now dont let it go 
 See what youve become dont sacrifice 
 Its truly the heart of everything 
 Open up your eyes open up your eyes 
 Open up your eyes its the heart of everything 
 Stay with me now Im facing my last solemn hour 
 Very soon Ill embrace you on the other side 
 Hear the crowd in the distance screaming out my faith 
 Now their voices are fading I can feel no more pain 
 Its truly the heart of everythingIf I tell you 
 Will you listen 
 Will you stay 
 Will you be here forever 
 Never go away 
 Never thought things would change 
 Hold me tight 
 Please dont say again 
 That you have to go 
 A bitter thought 
 I had it all 
 But I just let it go 
 Oh this silence 
 Its so violent 
 Since yourre gone 
 All my thoughts are with you forever 
 Until the day well be back together 
 I will be waiting for you 
 If I had told you 
 You would have listened 
 You had stayed 
 You would be here forever 
 Never went away 
 It would never have been the same 
 All our time 
 Would have been in vain 
 Cause you had to go 
 The sweetest thought 
 Cause I did let you go 
 All our moments 
 Keep me warm 
 When youre gone 
 I will be waiting for youIm on a road of broken dreams 
 And I need to know why 
 Seek the truth through lies to be my guide 
 Im in a world of doubt and trust cant deny 
 I lost my way here in this quest cant lie 
 I cant believe whats happening 
 I dont know what to say 
 I cant believe Id live to see this day 
 I dont wanna live this way it haunts my mind 
 And I just need to get it straight stop wasting time 
 And I dont wanna live in fear but I cant change whats wrong 
 But I know wont be living in a lie 
 Oh Ill be hanging on the cross 
 When I put the nails in 
 Its time to choose a road that we believe in 
 You say you understand it all try and smile 
 If only I could see its true somehow 
 And what I wouldnt give to change our fate 
 And I dont wanna live in fear but I can change whats wrong 
 And Ive tried so hard to hold on 
 But I keep on falling 
 And no matter how hard I run 
 I just keep returning 
 And Im back to where I started from 
 I dont wanna live this way it haunts my mind 
 And I just need to get it straight stop wasting time 
 But I know wont be living in a lieYour back against the wall 
 Take or leave it all 
 Only this lifetime 
 Is it worth it all 
 Run or take the fall 
 Only this lifetime with me 
 With arms open wide 
 Just living on fire 
 I leaned out my hand 
 Its all that I can 
 Theres nothing I hide 
 Living on fire fire 
 Feel it all 
 With arms wide open 
 Fire fire 
 Your back against the wall 
 With arms wide openWhere are the heroes in my time of need 
 Is my cry not loud enough or have they gone all numb 
 They just tend to stand out of the rain 
 Thinking but not acting that theyre not to blame 
 Falling and crawling 
 A fight to stand up 
 Memory still haunts me 
 In the dead of night 
 Over and over 
 I felt so small 
 But one day Ill be stronger 
 And youd better watch out 
 I will overcome 
 Your violence their silence 
 Although it cant be undone 
 I will overcome 
 Knowing that Im not the only one 
 I will overcome 
 Its the only way to carry on 
 Where are the saviours afraid of the toll 
 Sorry do my nine inch nails slash your soul 
 Such heroes throwing stones 
 Straight at the one who is standing alone 
 Twisting and turning 
 Its always the same 
 Truth is never honest 
 When youre to blame 
 Pushing and pulling 
 I never give in 
 But one day I wish youll see 
 Youre not so beautiful within 
 Your violence your silence 
 Although 
 It cant be undone 
 Knowing that Im not the only one 
 Its the only way to carry on 
 Run and run 
 Their violence your silence 
 I will overcomeDetermined by your faith you attempt to make up 
 You lay out your case like the enemy 
 But all that you got through dirty white lies 
 Youll find the damn correct way of blaming me for your crimes 
 Wont you talk to me 
 Dont walk or run away 
 Im onto you yesterday 
 With empty eyes 
 I dont know where Im going 
 In search for answers 
 I dont know who Im fighting 
 I stand with empty eyes 
 Youre like the ghost within me 
 Whos draining my life 
 Its like my soul is see through 
 Right through my empty eyes 
 Right through my empty eyes 
 Im about to give in I got nowhere to go 
 Afraid of the sins Im holding on 
 Theres no other way no doubt in the end 
 But I aint got a thing to lose nothing to defend 
 Ooh please wont you give in to me 
 Wont you finally speak truthfully 
 Determined by your faith you attempt to make up 
 You lay out your case like the enemy like the enemy 
 Right through my empty eyesTheres no sense the fire burns 
 When wisdom fails it changes all 
 The wheel embodies all that keeps on turnin 
 Blood red skies I feel so cold 
 No innocence we play our role 
 The wheel embodies all where are we goin 
 All in all youd expect the wise to be wiser 
 Fallen from grace and 
 All and all I guess we should have known better cause 
 What about us Isnt it enough 
 No were not in paradise 
 This is who we are this is what weve got 
 No its not our paradise 
 But its all we want and its all that were fightin for 
 Though its not paradise 
 You and us or I and them 
 There comes a time to take a stand 
 The wheel is watchin all that keeps on burnin 
 The venom works its like a curse 
 A Trojan horse when will we learn 
 The wheel embodies all that keeps returnin 
 But its not paradise 
 What about us What about us 
 What about us Isnt it enoughEvery word youre saying is a lie 
 Run away my dear 
 But every sign will say your heart is deaf 
 Bury all the memories 
 Cover them with dirt 
 Wheres the love we once had 
 Our destinys unsure 
 Why cant you see what we had 
 Let the fire burn the ice 
 Is it all a lie 
 And I still wonder 
 Why our heaven has died 
 The skies are all falling 
 Im breathing but why 
 In silence I hold on 
 To you and I 
 Closer to insanity 
 Buries me alive 
 Wheres the life we once had 
 It cannot be denied 
 You run away 
 You hide away 
 To the other side of the universe 
 Where youre safe from all that hunts you down 
 But the world is gone 
 Where you belong 
 And it feels too late so youre moving on 
 But can you find your way back home 
 Every word youre saying is a lieWeve been seein what you wanted 
 Got us cornered right now 
 Fallen asleep from our vanity 
 Might cost us our lives 
 I hear theyre gettin closer 
 Their howls are sendin chills down my spine 
 And time is runnin out now 
 Theyre comin down the hills from behind 
 When we start killin 
 Its all comin down right now 
 From the nightmare weve created 
 I want to be awakened somehow 
 I want to be awakened right now 
 It all will be fallin down 
 From the hell that were in 
 All we are is fadin away 
 Weve been searchin all night long 
 But theres no trace to be found 
 Its like they all have just vanished 
 But I know theyre around 
 I feel theyre gettin closer 
 The sun is risin the screams have gone 
 Too many have fallen few still stand tall 
 Is this the endin of what weve begun 
 Will we remember what weve done wrong 
 When we start killinCannot swallow the soil make it all beautiful 
 Cannot carry you carry you carry you now 
 The truth cant bear the sunlight youre afraid for the day it does 
 And when I told you so 
 I got burned burned burned again 
 Heaven forbid that my heart is for sale 
 Hope in the end truth prevails 
 Im gonna run to the edge of the world run to the edge of the world 
 Feel that Im gonna get home if I try 
 Need to find my way home home 
 Youre as proud as a god 
 But I believed in your heart 
 And Ill be leaving you leaving you leaving you now 
 The truth cant bear the sunlight 
 And dont pretend to be my guide 
 You said youd change it all but I got burned burned burned instead 
 Heaven can wait cause my soul aint for sale 
 Justify 
 No more lies 
 Once upon a timeI feel my heart explode to particles 
 Love is always here and I told you so 
 Restless in dreams love carved in stone 
 This rhapsody of life in a way 
 I guess we all know it 
 Hand in hand we stand while we watch it flow 
 Heaven can you help us No we cant go 
 Covered by roses 
 When this dance is over 
 We all know our beauty will die 
 The choirs have awoken 
 Left no words unspoken 
 Remember you as long as I can 
 Hold you in my arms all night 
 And spill the wine until the end 
 We all have our place in time 
 Need to live every moment 
 We built our castles high turned our dreams to gold 
 We took the blows with pride went through it all 
 The dawn is closing in new tales are told 
 I guess we all know 
 For all we are is falling stars in the night 
 A blinding light raging down from the sky 
 The rise and fall the rhapsody of our lives 
 So we all let go we gotta let go 
 She dwells with beauty beauty that must die 
 And joy whose hand is ever at his lips 
 His soul shall taste the sadness of her might 
 And be among her butty trophies hung 
 Covered by covered by 
 Need to live every momentIve been dreaming for so long 
 To find a meaning to understand 
 The secret of life 
 Why am I here to try again 
 Will I always will you always 
 See the truth when it stares you in the face 
 Will I ever will I never free myself 
 By breaking these chains 
 Id give my heart give my soul 
 Id turn it back its my fault 
 Your destiny is forlorn 
 Have to live till its undone 
 Id turn it back and then at last Ill be on my way 
 Ive been living for so long 
 Many seasons passed me by 
 Ive seen kingdoms through ages 
 Rise and fall Ive seen it all 
 Seen the horror seen the wonders 
 Happening just in front of my eyes 
 Will I ever will I never free myself by making it right 
 Jillian our dream ended long ago 
 All our stories and all our glory I held so dear 
 We wont be together 
 For ever and ever no more tears 
 Ill always be here til the end 
 Jillian no more tears 
 Id turn it back and then at last Ill be on my wayTake away 
 These hands of darkness 
 Reaching for my soul 
 Now the cold wind 
 Blows out my candles 
 Feeling 
 Only fear 
 Without any hope 
 A thousand dark moons 
 A thousand winters long 
 A million fallen stars 
 The candle burns in the womb 
 We try not to forget 
 They live through us 
 Slowly they die away at every candles end 
 A thousand dark moons 
 The candle burns in the womb 
 They live through us 
 Slowly they die away at every candles endYou live your life 
 You go day by day 
 Like nothing can go wrong 
 Then scars are made 
 Theyre changing the game 
 You learn to play it hard 
 And I know you wish for more 
 And I know you try 
 And I hope you realize 
 You know the time is right 
 The whole world is watching when you rise 
 The whole world is beating for you right now 
 Your whole life is flashing for your eyes 
 Its all in this moment that changes all 
 What are you waiting for 
 What are you fighting for 
 Cause times always slipping away 
 The whole world is watching 
 Yeah the whole world is watching you when you rise 
 You build your walls 
 And break them away 
 Cause that is what it takes 
 Youve saved yourself 
 Youve found who you are 
 That never goes away 
 Cause times always slipping away 
 Your sacrifice goes through your mind 
 But nothing is wasted 
 Youve made it now 
 Youll rise again 
 Breaking out 
 Each step that youve taken 
 Youve paid the price 
 Yeah the whole world is watching you when you riseThe child without a name grew up to be the hand 
 To watch you to shield you or kill on demand 
 The choice hed made he could not comprehend 
 His blood a grim secret they had to command 
 Hes torn between his honor and the true love of his life 
 He prayed for both but was denied 
 So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed 
 Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind 
 So many years have past who are the noble and the wise 
 Will all our sins be justified 
 The curse of his powers tormented his life 
 Obeying the crown was a sinister price 
 His soul was tortured by love and by pain 
 He surely would flee but the oath made him stay 
 Please forgive me for the sorrow for leaving you in fear 
 For the dreams we had to silence thats all theyll ever be 
 Still Ill be the hand that serves you 
 Though youll not see that it is me 
 Will all our sins be justifiedI know I wont change I have tried 
 Was feelin so caged hands tied 
 I cant find anything feelin so right 
 Its blindin hope 
 The Reaper is close seen his smile 
 A matter of time cant deny 
 I wont turn around round round 
 This destinys mine 
 The countdown has begun 
 The walls are fallin down 
 My life is on the line 
 The freedom is mine 
 Its dangerous to sacrifice 
 It makes your blood run to throw the dice 
 Its dangerous its what you like 
 Its what youll die for to live this life 
 Were goin on and well never stop 
 Were goin on till our worlds collide 
 Its dangerous so dangerous dangerous 
 I know its not safe close my eyes 
 I search for the edge of life 
 Cause thats the only place Ill ever find 
 That makes me whole 
 A thief in the night out of sight 
 Its out there waiting to ignite 
 The fever will rise rise rise 
 Taking over my mind 
 Countdown has begun 
 Walls are fallin down 
 Life is on the line 
 Nothing matters anyhow its like Im floating off the ground 
 Into the hands of air I dive rays of light flashing by 
 Like the time is slowin down when the world is out of sight 
 All the memories in my mind wont leave me behind 
 Its dangerous 
 Dangerous 
 Its dangerous its what youre like 
 So dangerous 
 DangerousThe darkness has come to the roses 
 The fire is reaching the air 
 The colours that I have created 
 Are suddenly flying away 
 Im not fighting myself will not follow 
 Cause my choices are mine its my fate 
 And Ill never bow down from the sorrow 
 Ill face all that is coming my way 
 The lying the devil the silence 
 Embracing the world on the edge 
 Let us burn 
 The night in the skies here tonight 
 In this fire that makes us yearn 
 Were fighting our fear of the silence 
 Were running through walls where they stand 
 Im searching no more for tomorrow 
 I reach for the skies while I can 
 The unknown will always be waiting 
 My last day Ill jump in its hands 
 Why why dont you let me burn 
 Why dont you come down 
 And break out and let me burn 
 Oh why why dont you let me burn 
 Why dont you let me burn 
 Oh why 
 Chasing the demons in my mind 
 Oh why me 
 Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground 
 The darkness has come to the roses 
 And the fire is reaching the air 
 Let us burnTurn around open your eyes 
 Cant move on the fear is tyin you down 
 Open your eyes 
 Its alright 
 Oh 
 Im hellbound in this life 
 Keep fightin this endless war 
 Its always been like this 
 I dont know why 
 Enslavement of your mind 
 Your fear it ties me down 
 Goin down I wont bow 
 No 
 Screamin at the walls of fire 
 They are closing in on me 
 Closing in on me 
 Im hungry for the burnin of the silver moonlight 
 Its where I wanna be 
 Where I wanna be 
 But Im still runnin free 
 Im still runnin free 
 In the silver moonlight 
 I cant breathe 
 I cant breathe 
 These days are lonely now 
 Breathin in the coldest lies 
 I think thats only what you have in mind 
 Holdin on to the best of you 
 I hit the pavement 
 Down 
 Ive been patient 
 But its colors that I need 
 Too many shades of gray 
 I cannot breathe 
 The dreams I havent tainted 
 Need you to believe 
 The only way to make them real 
 Oh 
 I cant breath 
 Turn around open your eyes 
 Its alrightGive me strength to face the truth the doubt within my soul 
 No longer I can justify the bloodshed in His name 
 Is it a sin to seek the truth the truth beneath the rose 
 Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heavens door 
 I believed it would justify the means 
 It had a hold over me 
 Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast 
 It is the darker side of me 
 Forgive me my sins 
 The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen 
 Forgive me for what I have been 
 Forgive me my sins 
 Pray for me cause I have lost my faith in holy wars 
 Is paradise denied to me cause I cant take no more 
 Has darkness taken over me consumed my mortal soul 
 All my virtues sacrificed can Heaven be so cruel 
 Im hoping Im praying 
 I wont get lost between two worlds 
 For all I have seen the truth lies in between 
 Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done 
 Now that I know the darkest side of me 
 How can blood be our salvation 
 And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times 
 Will I learn whats truly sacred 
 Will I redeem my soul 
 Will truth set me free 
 Et est signum dies datus et tenebris 
 Mea culpa acta est fabula pereoThe world seems not the same 
 Though I know nothing has changed 
 Its all my state of mind 
 I cant leave it all behind 
 I have to stand up to be stronger 
 I have to try to break free 
 From the thoughts in my mind 
 Use the time that I have 
 I cant say goodbye 
 Have to make it right 
 Have to fight cause I know 
 In the end its worthwhile 
 That the pain that I feel slowly fades away 
 It will be all right 
 I know should realise 
 Time is precious it is worthwhile 
 Despite how I feel inside 
 Have to trust it will be all right 
 Have to stand up to be stronger 
 Oh this night is too long 
 I have no strength to go on 
 No more pain Im floating away 
 Through the mist I see the face 
 Of an angel who calls my name 
 I remember youre the reason I have to stay 
 It will be all rightCouldnt save you from the start 
 Love you so it hurts my soul 
 Can you forgive me for trying again 
 Your silence makes me hold my breath 
 Time has passed you by 
 Oh for so long Ive tried to shield you from the world 
 Oh you couldnt face the freedom on your own 
 Here I am left in silence 
 You gave up the fight 
 You left me behind 
 All thats dones forgiven 
 Youll always be mine 
 I know deep inside 
 I watched the clouds drifting away 
 Still the sun cant warm my face 
 I know it was destined to go wrong 
 You were looking for the great escape 
 To chase your demons away 
 And here I am left in silence 
 Ive been so lost since youve gone 
 Why not me before you 
 Why did fate deceive me 
 Everything turned out so wrong 
 Why did you leave me in silence 
 All thats dones forgivenShe sang for you last night she heard you were calling 
 Yearning in tears a thousand times 
 Your spirit was floating your spirit was searching 
 On a cloud of dreams 
 A moon beam shines bright in the city of angels 
 Guiding the dreamers back to life 
 And theyll do the same every tomorrow 
 Till the pain subsides 
 Dont be scared now 
 Close your eyes 
 She holds guard tonight 
 Go on forward 
 No remorse 
 Life will take its course 
 She danced with you last night so you will remember 
 All you have shared the lifetime 
 The angels were watching and death will be waiting 
 Until the time is right 
 Hold on to memories 
 See what lies ahead 
 Life will go on and we are one 
 With every step you takeOver the hills lies a new beginning 
 Over the hills 
 Over the hills there is a way I know it 
 You cant bring all the gloom 
 Your heart is frayed and so empty 
 You glorify the future 
 Living in a different world than me 
 The journey ends in death 
 You are giving up so easily 
 You are the other half of me 
 We are drifting apart 
 Chilled to the marrow cause you dont want to go 
 Cause weve got a different wish at heart 
 The amulet guides us to the other side 
 When I go down its you wholl bleed 
 Im not scared to die as long as Im with you 
 Over the hills lies a new beginning 
 Over the hillsThe turn against 
 The world we know 
 Now our destiny 
 Will be decided 
 We have to send our brothers in arms 
 With pain in our heart 
 We watched them go 
 Will they return 
 Truth is we had no choice 
 Well try to shield those we can 
 No better world 
 Let this end 
 Mothers cry 
 Our boys die 
 But well stand till the endShes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer 
 Nother day nother night 
 And she acting like she dont sleep 
 Shes a five when she drinks 
 But shes a ten when shes on top of him 
 She dont want love she just wanna touch 
 Shes a greedy girl to never get enough 
 She dont wanna love she just wanna touch 
 Shes got all the moves that make you get it up 
 Shes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer 
 Never ever lonely 
 Youll never be her only 
 Its a game that she plays 
 She can win with her eyes closed 
 Its insane how she tames 
 She can turn you to an animal 
 Shes got all the moves that make you give it up 
 The girl dont stop 
 Dirty dancer 
 The girl dont stopAfter the cold darkness 
 In the heart of the forest 
 Where birds are singing 
 For the new born sun 
 In the womb of the leaves 
 On the branches of the trees 
 Lies the treasure of the morning 
 The Pearls of Light 
 Carried away by the truculence of my world 
 I got lost in the search for enlightenment 
 The blue rain covered my roots 
 And I forgot where I came from 
 And I forgot where I came fromWe can be friends 
 Of course we can 
 Sorry did my nineinch nails cut your soul 
 Such a hero throwing stones 
 To the one that really stands here all alone 
 Crawling and crawling 
 Cant get up 
 All these years of silence 
 But I wont give up 
 See you suffer 
 Holding me down 
 One day I will be somebody 
 Youd better watch out 
 I will overcome 
 In violence your silence can never be undone 
 Maybe in the second round 
 We can be friends 
 Run and run 
 In silence your violence can never be undone 
 RunI know youre going away 
 I take my love into another day 
 In my thoughts youre with me 
 I fell in love with your ways 
 I know youre going away 
 Lead my heart into a daze 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soul 
 Wherever you are 
 Whatever you do 
 I feel the walls surrounding you 
 I know you are independent 
 But Im trying to get through to you 
 Dont you know it depends on you 
 Leaves a void in my heart and soulWeve been dreaming for so long 
 Endless wisdom comes our way 
 And before he his time has 
 Never failing until the end 
 Well always well always 
 See the truthless skies in your face 
 Well never well never 
 See the love when having goodbye 
 If you want to belong 
 And never see youre facing 
 To feel the sorrow 
 And never see the truth 
 Its too long to belong 
 And never see your face 
 And never to be strong 
 Weve been dreaming for so long 
 Can his words taken you way 
 Never faling until the end 
 For how long 
 The dream has sinned long ago 
 We tell our stories and endless worries found in here 
 Well be together for ever and ever 
 Found in here 
 Well always be 
 And never to be strongIn a world so far away 
 At the end of a closing day 
 A little child was born and raised 
 Deep in the forest on a hidden place 
 Mother never saw his face 
 Ancient spirits of the forest 
 Made him king of elves and trees 
 He was the only human being 
 Who lived in harmony 
 In perfect harmony 
 The woods protected fulfilled his needs 
 Fruit by birds honey by bees 
 He found shelter under the trees 
 He grew up in their company 
 They became his family 
 A thousand seasons 
 They passed him by 
 So many times have said goodbye 
 And when the spirits called out his name 
 To join forever forever to stay 
 A forest spirit he became 
 In perfect harmonyFor so long Ive tried 
 Could not close my eyes 
 When you became an outcast in this life 
 Again and again I try 
 To understand the demons inside your head 
 But the truth is 
 You love them to death 
 Now I know its the last time I have tried 
 To lift you up to make you fight 
 Nothing is ever easy in life 
 I cant change it if you dont 
 Have the will deep inside 
 I have been blind to 
 How you justify 
 Everything that youve wasted in this life 
 Got lost in the illusion 
 Id find a solution for the demons in your head 
 You can blame and you can hide 
 Behind what is wrong and what is right 
 Life is the choices we make 
 I hope youll awake before its too late 
 Have the will deep insideI did my best to please you 
 But my best was never good enough 
 Somehow youre only able to see 
 All I am not 
 Did you ever look behind 
 Arent you afraid of the pieces youll find 
 I have failed you 
 But you have failed me too 
 Its so easy to destroy and condemn 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if its justified 
 The ones you do not understand 
 In your life why didnt you ever try 
 I close my eyes as I walk 
 The thin line between love and hate 
 For the person with the same blood 
 In his veins 
 You show no regrets 
 About all the things you did or said 
 But believe me you failed me too 
 The ones you do not understand 
 Do you ever wonder if its justified 
 Do you ever wonder if its justifiedIn my hands 
 A legacy of memories 
 I can hear you say my name 
 I can almost see your smile 
 Feel the warmth of your embrace 
 But there is nothing but silence now 
 Around the one I loved 
 Is this our farewell 
 Sweet darling 
 You worry too much my child 
 See the sadness in your eyes 
 You are not alone in life 
 Although you might think that you are 
 Never thought 
 This day would come so soon 
 We had no time to say goodbye 
 How can the world just carry on 
 I feel so lost when you are not by my side 
 So sorry your world is tumbling down 
 I will watch you through these nights 
 Rest your head and go to sleep 
 Because my child 
 This is not our farewell 
 This is not our farewellHe feeds on fear 
 He feeds on pain 
 He rules again 
 With growing hate 
 He will gain 
 Their faith again 
 No light in the darkness 
 Is too small to see 
 Theres always a sparkle of hope 
 If you just believe 
 He told the tale so many times 
 About the dream not meant to be 
 In a world of the free 
 Plays with your mind 
 As faith for the future faded fast 
 He grows strong with their displeasure 
 It sets him free 
 Deceiver of hearts 
 Deceiver of fools 
 He rules with fear 
 Deceiver of hopes 
 He feeds on fear 
 Poisons the truth 
 To gain their faith 
 To lead the way 
 To a world of decay 
 Rules your heart 
 Hell sell your soul to the grave 
 Without a hesitation to make 
 He belongs to the dark 
 Please awake 
 And see the truth 
 He can only be 
 If you believe what he tells you 
 Remember who you are 
 What you stand for 
 And there will always be a way 
 In my heart there is a place 
 In my heart there is a trace 
 Of a small fire burning 
 A sheltering ray shines through this night 
 Although its small its bright 
 But darkness is lurking 
 He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold 
 Oh fear him 
 Shall he rule againIve been left out alone like a damn criminal 
 Ive been praying for help cause I cant take it all 
 Im not done its not over 
 Now Im fighting this war since the day of the fall 
 And Im desperately holding onto it all 
 But Im lost Im so damn lost 
 Oh I wish it was over and I wish you were here 
 Still Im hoping that somehow 
 Cause your soul is on fire a shot in the dark 
 What did they aim for when they missed your heart 
 I breathe underwater its all in my hands 
 But what can I do Dont let it fall apart 
 A shot in the dark 
 In the blink of an eye I can see through your eyes 
 As Im lying awake Im still hearing the cries 
 And it hurts hurts me so bad 
 And Im wondering why I still fight in this life 
 Cause Ive lost all my faith in this damned bitter strife 
 And its sad its so damn sad 
 I feel you fading away 
 Oh your soul is on fire a shot in the dark 
 A shot in the darkWhy you just wont leave my mind 
 Was this the only way 
 I couldnt let you stay 
 Run away hide away 
 The secrets in your mind 
 Sacrificed just her life 
 For a higher love 
 No matter how many stones you put inside 
 Shell always keeps on floating in your mind 
 With every turn of your head you see her face again 
 Until the end over and over again 
 Why you just wont leave my mind 
 Told the truth she laughed at you 
 Something snapped inside 
 She had to go or they would know 
 All you tried to hide 
 The sins of your life are now catching up with you 
 You cant stay ahead Theres nothing you can do 
 I couldnt let you stay 
 Spoken by Mother Maiden 
  
 Some may call it a curse 
 A life like mine 
 But others a blessing 
 Its certainly a lonely life 
 But a fulfilling one at best 
 Its my cross to bear 
 And I bear it gladly 
 Someone has to take a stand against evil 
 Why should it not be meSomeone is dancing 
 On my grave 
 Sending shivers 
 Down my spine 
 I hear a laugh 
 It awoke my soul 
 The wind takes the leaves 
 Where he wants them to go 
 His tunes enchant our world 
 Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
 In this heart of mine 
 Its you I find 
 Take my hand 
 Ill take you to the promised land 
 Youre the one 
 It awoke my soul 
 His tunes enchant our world 
 Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
 Ill take you to the promised land 
 Nevil whatever you have done 
 These tears will fade 
 Nevil wherever you have gone 
 Please have faithIm holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the ground 
 And Im hearing what you say 
 But I just cant make a sound 
 You tell me that you need me 
 Then you go and cut me down but wait 
 You tell me that youre sorry 
 Didnt think Id turn around and say 
 That its too late to apologize its too late 
 I said its too late to apologize its too late 
 Id take another chance 
 Take a fall take a shot for you 
 And I need you like a heart needs a beat 
 But its nothing new yeah 
 I loved you with a fire red 
 Now its turning blue and you say 
 Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you 
 But Im afraid 
 Its too late to apologize its too late 
 Im holding on your rope 
 Got me ten feet off the groundThese are the darkest clouds 
 They have surrounded me 
 Now I find my self alone caught in a cage 
 Theres no flower I can find in here 
 Not withering 
 Not pale to me 
 Everyone with a friendly face 
 Seems to hide some secret inside 
 He told me he loved me 
 While he laughed in my face 
 He just led me astray 
 He took my virtue 
 I feel so cold inside 
 Sorrow has frozen my mind 
 My heart is covered 
 With thoughts entangled 
 How could it ever have felt so real 
 Is there a place more lonely than I feel within 
 Could I have seen 
 Could I have known 
 I just took it as the truth 
 Always there to remind me 
 It keeps me from believing 
 That someone might be there 
 Wholl free me and never ever leave meIve been losin myself in anger 
 So much broken by the rage 
 Nothin could take my mind off 
 How to make them pay 
 Killin myself for nothin 
 And the pain wont go away 
 Losin myself to madness 
 And the games been played 
 If I could turn 
 The hands of time I would 
 But here I am 
 Tell me why am I still here when its all gone 
 Im livin with the ghost of yesterday 
 Tell me why am I still tryin to hold on 
 Ive got to tear it down to let it go 
 Im too tired to keep on tryin 
 But Im spellbound till the end 
 Knowin that theres no closure 
 For my wars inside 
 Ive buried the good and evil 
 Only memories left behind 
 I am the one still standin 
 I will live to tell 
 Here I am 
 Tell me why Im wastin away 
 Wastin away 
 Tell me how to break my own chains 
 Break my own chains 
 Cause Im losin after all 
 How can I escape this grim fate 
 Escape this grim fate 
 Tell me how to face one more day 
 Face one more day 
 Cause Im wastin away 
 Its all gone silent 
 Im searchin for fire 
 Nothin to fight for alone 
 Ive got to tear it down to let it goWhy was I one of the chosen ones 
 Until the fight I could not see 
 The magic and the strength of my power 
 It was beyond my wildest dreams 
 Dark wings they are descending 
 See shadows gathering around 
 One by one they are falling 
 Every time they try to strike us down 
 Dont you die on me 
 You havent made your peace 
 Live a life breathe breathe 
 As they took your soul away 
 The night turned into the day 
 Blinded by your rays of life 
 Gave us the strength we needed 
 Every time they try to strike us 
 Every time they try to strike us downShe embraced with a smile 
 As she opened the door 
 A cold wind blows 
 It puts a chill 
 Into her heart 
 You have taken away the trust 
 Youre the ghost haunting through her heart 
 Past and present are one in her head 
 Take my hand as I wander through 
 All of my life I gave to you 
 All of my love I gave to you 
 Lai lai lai la lai lai lai la lai lai lai lai lai la lai lai lai 
 Lai lai lai la lai 
 La la la lai 
 Lai la la 
 Lai lai lai 
 Lai lai laiNow the day has come 
 We are forsaken this time 
 We lived our lives in our paradise 
 As gods we shaped the world around 
 No borderlines wed stay behind 
 Though balance is something fragile 
 While we thought we were gaining 
 Wed turn back the tide it still slips away 
 Our time has run out our future has died 
 Theres no more escape 
 Now the day has come 
 We are forsaken 
 Theres no time anymore 
 Life will pass us by 
 Were the last of our kind 
 The sacrifice was much too high 
 Our greed just made us all go blind 
 We tried to hide what we feared inside 
 Today is the end of tomorrow 
 As the sea started rising 
 The land that we conquered just washed away 
 Although we all have tried to turn back the tide 
 It was all in vain 
 Only ruins stay behind 
 Now the day has come 
 The day has come 
 The day has comeIm waking up to ash and dust 
 I wipe my brow and sweat my rust 
 Im breathing in the chemicals 
 Im breaking in and shaping up 
 Then checking out on the prison bus 
 This is it the apocalypse whoa 
 Im waking up I feel it in my bones 
 Enough to make my system blow 
 Welcome to the new age to the new age 
 Whoa oh Whoa Im radioactive radioactive 
 I raise my flag dye my clothes 
 Its a revolution I suppose 
 Were painted red to fit right in whoa 
 All systems go the sun hasnt died 
 Deep in my bones straight from inside 
 Whoa oh Whoa Im radioactive radioactiveNothings ever changed you still turn away 
 Youve washed your hands youve made that all too clear 
 You just keep on living this lie 
 You refuse to see youre denying me 
 The cross I bear but you dont seem to care 
 Even Judas knew he had lied 
 I keep wondering why 
 Im still calling your name through my tears 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear 
 Cold is your silence denying what is real 
 Im still wondering why 
 Im still calling your name my dear 
 Im sorry if you cant stand the naked truth 
 All you see is how you want it to be 
 So you keep on living your life 
 Release me from this cross after all these years 
 Oh call my name and help me with this weight 
 Even though it comes far too late 
 Why have you waited to embrace me my dear 
 Im still wondering why Im still calling your name 
 And I wonder oh I wonder  
 In my heart I still hope you will open the door 
 You can purify it all answer my call 
 Why Why 
 You can purify it all answer my callI escaped my final moment 
 But its turning back at me 
 On every corner I can feel it waiting 
 Just a moment no awareness 
 I could easily slip away 
 And then Ill be gone forever 
 Im searching 
 Im fighting for a way to get through 
 To turn it away 
 Its waiting always trying 
 I feel the hands of fate theyre suffocating 
 Tell me whats the reason 
 Is it all inside my head 
 Cant take it no more 
 All around me I see danger 
 And its closing in on me 
 Every second I can hear it breathing 
 I cant stand the fear inside me 
 Cause its leading me astray 
 And it will be my ending 
 Im searching 
 But no one faced whats coming my way 
 And I will let my fear fade away 
 Whatever may be Ill have to find out 
 Cant take it no moreCold are the bones of thy soldiers 
 Longing for home their little paradise 
 I dont feel redemption on their side 
 Fallen from grace help me rise again 
 Fallen from grace help me through 
 Fallen from grace 
 Feel these hands the pressure the cold tremble 
 Do you hear these words 
 Do you feel the wounds 
 Ill never help you through 
 Cold are thy souls 
 I feel the resentment 
 They feel betrayed 
 They hate the cold 
 Fallen from grace help me throughI can see 
 When you stay low 
 Nothing happens 
 Does it feel right 
 Late at night 
 Things I thought Id put behind me 
 Haunt my mind 
 I just know theres no escape now 
 Once it sets its eyes on you 
 But I wont run 
 Have to stare it in the eyes 
 Stand my ground 
 I wont give in 
 No more denying 
 Ive gotta face it 
 Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
 If I dont make it someone else will 
 Its all around 
 Getting stronger coming closer into my world 
 I can feel that its time for me to face it 
 Can I take it 
 Though this might just be the ending 
 Of the life I held so dear 
 Theres no turning back from here 
 All I know for sure is that Im trying 
 I will always stand my ground 
 I wont give in I wont give in 
 I wont give up I wont give up 
 No more denying Ahhhhh 
 Stand my groundKiss me hard before you go 
 Summertime sadness 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That baby you the best 
 I got my red dress on tonight 
 Dancin in the dark in the pale moonlight 
 Done my hair up real big beauty queen style 
 High heels off Im feelin alive 
 Oh my God I feel it in the air 
 Telephone wires above 
 Are sizzlin like a snare 
 Honey Im on fire I feel it everywhere 
 Nothin scares me anymore 
 One two three four 
 Kiss me hard before you go 
 I got that summertime summertime sadness 
 Sususummertime summertime sadness

 Im feelin electric tonight 
 Cruisin down the coast goin about 99 
 Got my bad baby by my heavenly side 
 I know if I go Ill die happy tonight 
 Think Ill miss you forever 
 Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky 
 Laters better than never 
 Even if youre gone Im gonna drive 
 Got that summertime summertime sadnessIt burns into your heart the darkness that you fear 
 You were never free and you never realized 
 And love is a word youve never heard 
 Your heart aint cold cause it burns a desire to leave the mire 
 Take your breath till nothings left 
 Scars of life upon your chest 
 And I know wherever it goes 
 And we run with a lonely heart 
 And we run for this killin love 
 And we run till the heavens above 
 Yeah we run runnin in the dark 
 And we run till we fall apart 
 Dont blink youll miss it lift up your head 
 We gotta get gone yeah we outta here 
 Too late we gone yeah we outta here 
 And we long for a heavenly heart 
 Imma break these chains ran through the rain 
 Never looked back never quit work through the pain 
 This blood in my veins run cold when I think 
 Itll never be the same but I never lose hope 
 This is my time now no time for tears to celebrate 
 Put it in the air right now never back down 
 You can never wear my crown cause it weighs too much 
 And I crush every motherfuckin thing I touch 
 This is love Ive never loved so much 
 Get involved make the world stand up 
 Give my life before I ever give up 
 Name in lights you lost all my trust 
 Now its time to face all of us 
 Get in line cause theyre callin us 
 And it feels so marvelous 
 Just take my hand and run 
 Yeah we outta here 
 Too late we gone yeah we outta hereWake up in the dead of night 
 Dogs are turning wild 
 Run into whats wrong each time 
 Fail to get it right 
 Fighting off this heavy heart 
 Keeping your head high 
 Oh wont you please forget 
 Wont you please forget 
 These are the dog days 
 Leading our hearts astray 
 Soon they will fade away 
 1 2 3 4 
 Awakened by the dreams at night 
 Chills run down your spine 
 The brightest star in summer skies 
 Brings madness to our minds 
 Fighting off the darkest thoughts 
 Fighting to survive 
 These are the dog days 
 Embracing the highs to fight the lows 
 Running down the path that I think I need to go 
 When you think youve won youre still losing after all 
 These are the dog daysLost in the darkness 
 Hoping for a sign 
 Instead there is only silence 
 Cant you hear my screams 
 Never stop hoping 
 Need to know where you are 
 But one thing is for sure 
 Youre always in my heart 
 Ill find you somewhere 
 Ill keep on trying until my dying day 
 I just need to know whatever has happened 
 The truth will free my soul 
 Lost in the darkness try to find your way home 
 I want to embrace you and never let you go 
 Almost hope youre in heaven so no one can hurt your soul 
 Living in agony cause I just do not know where you are 
 Wherever you are 
 I wont stop searching 
 Whatever it takes 
 I need to know 
 The truth will free my soulArmies have conquered 
 And fallen in the end 
 Kingdoms have risen 
 Then buried by sand 
 The Earth is our mother 
 She gives and she takes 
 She puts us to sleep 
 In her light well awake 
 Well all be forgotten 
 Theres no endless fame 
 But everything we do 
 Its never in vain 
 Were part of a story part of a tale 
 Were all on this journey 
 No one is to stay 
 Where ever its going 
 What is the way 
 Forests and deserts 
 Rivers blue seas 
 Mountains and valleys 
 Nothing here stays 
 While we think we witness 
 We are part of the scene 
 This neverending story 
 Where will it lead to 
 The earth is our mother 
 But shes also a part 
 A part of the tale 
 No ones to stay 
 Oh where is it going 
 Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane 
 No one remembers how it began 
 No one remembers how it beganYou shout it out 
 But I cant hear a word you say 
 Talking loud 
 Not saying much 
 Criticize 
 But all your bullets ricochet 
 Shoot me down 
 But I get up 
 Im bulletproof 
 Nothing to lose 
 Fire away fire away 
 Ricochet 
 You take your aim 
 You shoot me down 
 But I wont fall 
 I am titanium 
 Cut me down 
 But its you wholl have further to fall 
 Ghost town 
 Haunted love 
 Raise your voice 
 Sticks and stones may break my bones 
 Stone heart 
 Machine gun 
 Firing at the ones who run 
 Loves bulletproof glass 
 I am titaniumIm dying to catch my breath 
 Oh why dont I ever learn 
 Ive lost all my trust 
 Though Ive surely tried to turn it around 
 Can you still see the heart of me 
 All my agony fades away 
 When you hold me in your embrace 
 Dont tear me down for all I need 
 Make my heart a better place 
 Give me something I can believe 
 Dont tear me down 
 Youve opened the door now dont let it close 
 Im here on the edge again 
 I wish I could let it go 
 I know that Im only one step away 
 From turning it around 
 Dont tear it down whats left of me 
 I tried many times but nothing was real 
 Make it fade away dont break me down 
 I want to believe that this is for real 
 Save me from my fear 
 Make my heart a better placeWould you mind if I hurt you 
 Understand that I need to 
 Wish that I had other choices 
 Than to harm the one I love 
 What have you done now 
 I know I better stop tryin 
 You know that theres no denyin 
 I wont show mercy on you now 
 I know I should stop believin 
 I know that theres no retrievin 
 Its over now what have you done 
 I have been waitin for someone like you 
 But now you are slippin away oh 
 What have you done now 
 Why why does fate make us suffer 
 Theres a curse between us between me and you 
 Would you mind if I killed you 
 Would you mind if I tried to 
 Cause you have turned into my worst enemy 
 You carry hate that I dont feel 
 What have you done what have you done 
 I will not fall wont let it go 
 We will be free when it ends 
 Theres a curse between us between me and youYour call is coming 
 Im dreaming away 
 For what lies hidden 
 It needs to be found 
 Sounds of freedom make me want to try 
 When the ghosts are found 
 They will lead us to tomorrow 
 Voices forgotten 
 I hear them close by 
 Ghosts from the past I can see through their eyes 
 Are these the ancestors leaving me signs 
 The sounds they are all around 
 Forces start moving out 
 Taking sides though theres so much 
 That I need to know 
 And soon it will be shown 
 When the ghosts are found they will lead us to tomorrow 
 If we could restart how it was before tomorrowLeft in the darkness 
 Here on your own 
 Woke up a memory 
 Feeding the pain 
 You cannot deny it 
 Theres nothing to say 
 Its all that you need to fire away 
 Oh damn the war is coming 
 Oh damn you feel you want it 
 Oh damn just bring it on today 
 You cant live without the fire 
 Its the heat that makes you strong 
 Cause youre born to live and fight it all the way 
 You cant hide what lies inside you 
 Its the only thing you know 
 Youll embrace it and never walk away 
 Dont walk away 
 Raised in this madness 
 Youre on your own 
 It makes you fearless 
 Dreams are a drug here 
 They get in your way 
 Thats what what you need to fight day by day 
  
 You need not fear us 
 Unless you are a Darkheart 
 A vile one who preys on the innocent 
 I promise 
 You cant hide forever from the empty darkness 
 For we will hunt you down like the animals you are 
 And pull you into the very bowels of Hell 
 Dont walk awayWell you only need the light when its burning low 
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
 Only know you love her when you let her go 
 Only know youve been high when youre feeling low 
 Only hate the road when youre missin home 
 And you let her go 
 Staring at the bottom of your glass 
 Hoping one day youll make a dream last 
 But dreams come slow and they go so fast 
 You see her when you close your eyes 
 Maybe one day youll understand why 
 Everything you touch surely dies 
 But you only need the light when its burning low 
 Staring at the ceiling in the dark 
 Same old empty feeling in your heart 
 Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast 
 Well you see her when you fall asleep 
 But never to touch and never to keep 
 Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep 
 Well you only need the light when its burning low 
 Well you let her go 
 Cause you only need the light when its burning low 
 And you let her goIve got to try its not over yet 
 No signals of life have you left 
 My heart is bleeding just for you 
 Bleeds for only 
 And it hurts to know the truth 
 Are you looking for savior 
 Chasing a dream 
 Love turned to hate 
 Now Im crossing the border 
 Sealing our fate 
 But Im not afraid 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad for the first time 
 Life is gonna turn around 
 Im telling you you will like it I know 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad its the first time 
 Only you can set it free 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad come break away with me 
 This second chance I know wont last 
 Buts OK got no regrets 
 And I I feel the end near Im no fool 
 Getting closer 
 But Im doing what I should 
 Ive been drowning in sorrow 
 Chasing tomorrow running away 
 Now youre crossing the borders 
 Sealing tomorrow but youre not afraid 
 Im telling you you will like it 
 Im telling you you will like it I know Wohoho 
 Wohoho SinÃ©ad come break away with meO deus eicie 
 Mortatis animus solum est 
 Letalis animus concidamus unis 
 Osstendo malum osstendo lux 
 Anima mortatis eternum est 
 Anima irrata belli somnium 
 Anima quiesa evitae somnium 
 Anima mortatis eternum sunt 
 Osstendo malumIn this world you tried 
 Not leaving me alone behind 
 Theres no other way 
 I prayed to the gods let him stay 
 The memories ease the pain inside 
 Now I know why 
 All of my memories keep you near 
 In silent moments 
 Imagine youd be here 
 Your silent whispers silent tears 
 Made me promise Id try 
 To find my way back in this life 
 I hope there is a way 
 To give me a sign youre okay 
 Reminds me again its worth it all 
 So I can go home 
 Together in all these memories 
 I see your smile 
 All the memories I hold dear 
 Darling you know Ill love you 
 Til the end of time 
 All of my memoriesI speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country of our empire of our allies and above all of the cause of Freedom 
 Sanctus Espiritus Redeem us from our solemn hour 
 Sanctus Espiritus Insanity is all around us 
 Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus 
 In my darkest hours I could not foresee 
 That the tide could turn so fast to this degree 
 Cant believe my eyes how can you be so blind 
 Is the heart of stone no empathy inside 
 Time keeps on slipping away and we havent learned 
 So in the end now what have we gained 
 Sanctus Espiritus Is this what we deserve 
 Can we break free from chains of neverending agony 
 Are they themselves to blame the misery the pain 
 Didnt we let go allowed it let it grow 
 If we cant restrain the beast which dwells inside 
 it will find its way somehow somewhere in time 
 Will we remember all of the suffering Cause if we fail it will be in vain 
 A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armoured tanks have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line and strong columns of their armoured vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day or two was without defenders They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track 
 Sanctus Espiritus Redeem us from our solemn hour Our solemn hour 
 Sanctus Espiritus Insanity is all around us All around us 
 Can we break free from chains of neverending agonyWinter has come for me cant carry on 
 The chains to my life are strong but soon theyll be gone 
 Ill spread my wings one more time 
 Is it a dream 
 All the ones Ive loved calling out my name 
 The sun warms my face 
 All the days of my life I see them passing me by 
 In my heart I know I can let go 
 In the end I will find some peace inside 
 New wings are growing tonight 
 As I am soaring Im one with the wind 
 I am longing to see you again its been so long 
 We will be together again 
 All the days of my life I see them passing me by
