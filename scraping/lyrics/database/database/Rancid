Broke, dough, dope, the line is choked 
 Smoked the last dollar to her name 
 Are you buying? 
 Are you selling girl? 
 Talking square never change 
 And if I really wanna know 
 What it means for her to be free 
 Oh she's mixing cocktails 
 In a squat down Avenue C 
 (Lord have mercy!) 
 The parasitic clean on the most list easy 
 Ah, don't give her a fight 
 The ditch is shallow so I know 
 There won't be no fucking rainbow inside 
 And they deny allegations so strenuously 
 Oh man, don't get outta control 
 She was left wrestling in her silent anger 
 So hell I can't be there for her 
 I ain't looking for answers 
 I don't want nothing is for free 
 I sure don't want your respect 
 I just wanna know who's talking to me 
 I just wanna know who's talkin' to me 
 I know she's jackin, homegirls mackin' 
 Tried to make sure, am I in love? 
 So she fixes them, oh to confuse them 
 Oh I know that, girl that's what you do 
 She made relationships and then runs the other way 
 Unstoppable for you and me 
 She won't relinquish herself to you, and I sense an emergency 
 She can cry, she can hide in the lower east side 
 There's a road in the fast lane cursed 
 Above all the infamous, wicked circus of the fools 
 And if I really want to know how the pernicious stay on top 
 Oh they don't break, no they don't fake 
 They make her wake 
 They don't stop 
 I ain't looking for answers 
 I don't want nothing is for free 
 I sure don't want your respect 
 I just wanna know who's talking to me 
 I just wanna know who's talkin' to me 
 Yeah 
 I just wanna know who's talkin' to me 
 I just wanna know 
 I just wanna know who's talkin' to meIf you lose me, you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 When you were sick I held your hand 
 When you were in trouble I tried to understand 
 To stay with you I'd do anything I can 
 'Cause, losing you was not part of the plan 
 Melbourne is a tropical London 
 American in a tropical London 
 Abandoned in a tropical London 
 Oh no, oh no 
 If you lose me you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 A souvenir reminds me of you 
 Everyday I cast a glimpse of us two 
 I'm the one called to the rescue 
 That's why I'm confused, you withdrew 
 Melbourne is a tropical London 
 American in a tropical London

 If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 Medication lead to an altercation 
 It's a hazardous in the valley of deception 
 And I walk along, but it was not my intention 
 Not my invention 
 But now my hearts been ripped wide open 
 If you lose me you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sure 
 If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing 
 That's one thing I know for sureClimb in 
 Climb in 
 Climb inside me... pain 
 Another night of drinkin' 
 Another night of being 
 Out of my head and I don't know 
 Where I was last night 
 Drinkin' on a empty stomach 
 Or an empty mind 
 It makes no difference when I'm way out of line 
 Things I can't remember comes back to haunt me 
 A lot of people out there who seem to want me 
 Climb in the bottle and never come out 
 I may know nothing but I'm good at something 
 I will drink till the sun comes up 
 No more one of these days gonna come out of my haze 
 Better hurry up it's getting harder to come backI'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back where I belong

 When the field's wide open 
 I'll pick the horse who's got the biggest heart 
 Let 'em run 
 Let 'em ride 
 Let 'em roll down the track 
 Let 'em win, place and show 
 Let 'em one dollar exact 
 Six furlongs 
 Four phillys 
 Three mares 
 Three years and up 
 Who measures up 
 Well I wish you luck 
 Who measures up 
 Well I wish you luck 
 This is not Churchill Downs 
 This is not Hollywood Park 
 When the field is wide open 
 I'll pick the horse who's got the biggest heart 
 Well they rush the windows and 
 Play odds on fave 
 But the starter in second deuces down 
 A bit of give and take 
 Race is a puzzler when they open 
 From the outside it's a hit and run and 
 They look back and 
 You can't count on that and 
 That's a fact and 
 The old men from El Cerrito 
 Who talk about their picks and 
 They talk about all the wins of 
 The great jock Leftgit Pincay 
 This is not Churchill Downs 
 This is not Hollywood Park 
 When the field is wide open 
 I'll pick the horse who's got the biggest heart 
 Every time I come back to the East Bay 
 I run into Big L. 
 Oh, my old friend Big L, 
 No, he's not doing so well. 
 See, me and Big L grew up 
 Across the freeway from the track. 
 Yes, we spent many, many, many, many 
 Days over at the track. 
 I see Big L rollin' up the street 
 On his little sister's, pink, ten-speed. 
 He said "Tim, Tim, don't you remember me?" 
 "Way back, from 1973?" 
 And every time I see him 
 He has to remind me, 
 Like I would ever, forget Big L. 
 But then, 
 Then he's gone, 
 Like a flash 
 But then he's gone, 
 Like a flash. 
 Yeah, like a flash, 
 Yeah. 
 Ok, 
 This is Rancid signin' off for now, 
 Until next time, 
 We'll see you guys later...I was an atheist 
 You wore the crucifix 
 We put our differences to the side 
 Lesson taught 
 Well, lesson learned 
 You told me not to mourn 
 Your heart was bigger than any man alive 
 Campbell California 
 Oh please don't let me down 
 Robert, I remember when you used to run the town 
 I'll never forget and I'll always be your friend 
 Well I'm gonna see you on the other side 
 I'm weakened at the knees 
 From the pain 
 Now you are free 
 I'll miss the days that you walked with me 
 Loyal brother

 Showed me how to be a man 
 I love you Robert and I always will

 Well I'm gonna see you on the other side

 The prophet speaks his language, reeks 
 A vile dogma that schemes and sneaks 
 His blood is weak, he's an oil sheik 
 Information leak, operation tweek 
 There's no security in the battlefield 
 Metal cannons shape the human shields 
 A brand new country, they're gonna build 
 One more riot that's self-willed 
 State out of control! 
 It's out of control! 
 State out of control! 
 We're outta control, we're outta control, 
 We're outta control, we're outta control! 
 Inject the poison into the bloodstream 
 Pick up your shovel, do what you're told 
 The probe is out, the watchdog grows 
 To incredible lengths to incredible lows 
 Well off your target now you have missed 
 Deliberate lying and recklessness 
 Don't get crushed in the iron fist 
 Resist, resist, resist, resist, resist! 
 State out of control! 
 It's out of control! 
 State out of control! 
 We're outta control, we're outta control, 
 We're outta control, we're outta control! 
 Control! 
 Control! 
 We're outta control!Never seen it come back again, till it dragged my heart around 
 There was nothing coming in, and there was nothing to be found 
 See, I don't know, if I can go, through another day like this 
 America's judging it's favorite son and there ain't nowhere (missing?) 
 'Cause I've seen it, 'cause I know it, 
 'Cause it's the end of the world tonight 
 'Cause I've seen it, 'cause I know it, 
 'Cause it's the end of the world tonight 
 Take it down, br-br-break it down, 'cause it ain't coming back again 
 And the feeling of the rhythm drums, it sings like me 
 See, I don't like it, you know I ??, and the rhythm would make you aware 
 'Cause this is the end and I wish it was something, better than this 
 'Cause I've seen it, 'cause I know it, 
 'Cause it's the end of the world tonight 
 'Cause I've seen it, 'cause I know it, 
 'Cause it's the end of the world tonight 
 That's right!Everybody saying we gotta take a chance 
 And telling me what the hell went wrong 
 We only listen to the words that we sing 
 Now a million are singing along 
 (Last one) 
 We got it right, you got wrong 
 We're still around (last one to die) 
 We're going up, you're going down 
 We're still around (last one to die) 
 The ones that counted us out 
 Regret that they picked the fight 
 We sit on top of the world 
 And we're proving it every night 
 (Last one) 
 We got it right, you got wrong, 
 We're still around (last one to die) 
 We're going up, you're going down 
 We're still around (last one to die) 
 Through the storm and the gigs 
 And the good and the bad 
 There ain't no doubt 
 We knew from the very first show, what it was all about 
 (Last one) 
 We got it right, you got wrong, 
 We're still around (last one to die) 
 We're going up, you're going down 
 We're still around (last one to die)Woooooooooh 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our songs now, 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our song 
 And they knew all the lyrics by heart, now, 
 And they play in the perfect key, 
 And their tombstones are silhouetted, 
 And the band I can barely see, 
 Well our spirit fades, hard and cheated, 
 When the funeral's over, I can't leave it, 
 Everyone's going home, I'm defeated. 
 Woooooooooh 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our songs now, 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our song 
 And the energy's so overwhelming, 
 And the echo from the crowd is deafening, 
 And the music conveyed is convincing, 
 And the world doesn't seem so daunting, 
 And the shimmer of light tells you secrets, 
 In the moon, the silhouettes in an instance, 
 And we are seen in perfect cadence. 
 Woooooooooh 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our songs now, 
 Ghost band, ghost band, 
 There's a ghost band, girl, playing our songI get violent when I'm fucked up 
 I get silent when I'm drugged up 
 I want excitement, if I don't get none, I go wild 
 I don't know what the fuck to do about it 
 If you play the game, you get nothing out of it 
 So find out for yourself, tryin' to be good 
 You better cheat cheat 
 No reason to play fair 
 Cheat cheat, you can't get anywhere 
 Cheat cheat if you can't win 
 Nobody knows what the fuck they're doin' 
 It's beyond their control, Friday night's a ruin 
 If you wanna survive, you better learn how to lie 
 You better cheat cheat 
 No reason to play fair 
 Cheat cheat, you can't get anywhere 
 Cheat cheat if you can't win 
 Don't you use the rules 
 They're not for you, they're for the fools 
 And you're a fool if you don't know that 
 So use the rules, you fuckin' foolIf the police come 
 And tromp the state 
 And there's a straight crisis 
 And melee 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go, let go, let go, disgruntled 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go, let go, let go, disgruntled 
 Reflect something 
 Of course you descend 
 Fighting conflict 
 Running fugitive 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go, let go, let go, disgruntled 
 And gradually erodes world technology 
 Let go, let go, let go, disgruntled 
 If the police come 
 And tromp the state 
 And there's a straight crisis 
 And meleeThey assumed I was guilty when I committed no crime 
 They said confessions bring lenience 
 So they put me on the line 
 So I protest a massacre's at the Tineman Square 
 My friend said yo stay away man you better not go fuckin' back there oh 
 They wouldn't let me write about my opinions about the state 
 And the freedom of expression they would never tolerate 
 And the military secrets that I never did steal 
 I didn't start no violence no and there was nobody that I killed 
 So I had a clear account of all the abuses of power 
 And the memories of homeland now gone sour 
 And I only got one weapon and it's so plain for me to see 
 My only weapon I call poetry 
 And I don't even know why 
 The truth seems like lie 
 In My cell there is no sky 
 When I was arrested in shanghai 
 In the wealth and privilege huh I was not born 
 But devotion and freedom and liberty I was sworn 
 So every emotion is studied watched and controlled 
 Who gets paid who gets disciplined and who gets rolled so 
 Transmitter beams my coordinates anywhere on earth 
 And as radio waves surviellence satalite burst 
 Open up your skull and let some knowledge come in 
 Yeah crack open the cranium and let awareness begin oh 
 And I don't even know why 
 The truth seems like lie 
 In My cell there is no sky 
 When I was arrested in shanghaiHey you in the red dress 
 I know you're not trying to impress me 
 In line from a distance 
 Too scared at all to ask your name 
 All alone in the dark summer night 
 And I regret to this day 
 That I never got your name 
 Do you wanna dance with me? 
 Do you wanna dance, rude girl? 
 Do you wanna dance with me? 
 Do you wanna dance, rude girl? 
 Waiting so patient 
 Waiting, waiting for an invitation 
 From excursion 
 Tell my friends a different version 
 All alone in the dark summer night

 That I never got your name 
 Do you wanna dance with me?

 With a gleaming success with the different tribes 
 Religious indifference mixed between the lies 
 Territorial companies they legitimize 
 Persecution to form enterprise 
 Now the U.N. is called to buffer it all 
 The problem is spreading international 
 Like Ireland's Belfast it's coming to be 
 A brand new key 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test... 
 She's got a new dress 
 She's gonna look her best 
 Yugoslavia's been blown to bits... Yeah! 
 She's got a new dress 
 She's lookin' to the west 
 We'll entertain the idea of a peaceful end 
 Serb tanks slow down to the used to been 
 Of a world which has seen the citizens die 
 While the innocent children play near by now 
 When I'm not getting through and see evidence 
 Another truth, we're bombing us 
 The time of civil war is shoot or I live 
 The chivalrous ones are never represented 
 Working class girl puts her money to the test... Yeah 
 She's got a new dress 
 She's gonna look her best 
 Yugoslavia's been blown to bits... Yeah 
 She's got a new dress 
 She's lookin' to the west 
 Allocating people for impurity 
 The methods of severance are dastardly 
 Try to cleanse the hands of the murdering 
 But the appendage of guilt is lingering 
 Shadows of soldiers lay nearby 
 The dead ones finally reach a compromise 
 Consumption of war lies in Bosnia 
 The destruction of war lies in BosniaWell the kids are all hopped up and ready to go 
 They're ready to go now 
 They've got their surfboards 
 And they're going to the discotheque a go go 
 But she just couldn't stay 
 She had to break away 
 Well New York City really has it all 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah

 She's a punk punk, a punk rocker 
 Punk punk, a punk rocker 
 Punk punk, a punk rockerWell it's just another day of getting into trouble 
 Chasing all the booze with another bottle 
 When I went into a bar looking for some quiet 
 I said the wrong thing and it turned into a riot 
 Hand good, hand good, face good, face good 
 I'm lucky to wake a face up 
 Hand good, hand good, face good, face good 
 I'm lucky to wake a face up 
 When I hit that summer with an angel on my shoulder 
 Another day living, another day older 
 Thank God I made it out this far 
 Tell my story to the boys with a guitar 
 Hand good, hand good, face good, face good 
 I'm lucky to wake a face up 
 Hand good, hand good, face good, face good 
 I'm lucky to wake a face upIf you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 Living and dying and the stories that are true 
 The secret to a good life is knowing when your through... 
 Sarah ceased existing long before she died 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle ride 
 ...If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 If you wanna make a move then you better come in 
 It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 Sarah ceased existing long before she died 
 A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle rideSmall sacrifices or otherwise few 
 Unity for the sake of the many forms 
 Oh they use imagination only few can go 
 Touch of madness only few ever know 
 Well you can go on your way 
 Or you can stagger through hell 
 You can lie on your back 
 Or you can stand up tall 
 In a state of confusion 
 Got nothing to do 
 I was connected respected 
 Watching you make it through 
 And all this rhetoric 
 They tell me to sing along 
 They said that you were dying 
 But I know that they were wrong 
 Second generation melting pot 
 You're ripped apart but you're never done 
 There she goes 
 It's all right 
 Nothing to do 
 Waste your time 
 And all this rhetoric 
 They tell me to sing along 
 They said that you were dying

 They tell me to sing along 
 They said that you were dying 
 But I know that they were wrongDon't worry about me, I'm gonna make it alright 
 Got my enemies crossed out in my sight 
 I take a bad situation gonna make it right 
 In the shadows of darkness I stand in the light 
 You see it's our style to keep it true 
 I've had a bad year, a lot to go through 
 I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue 
 She's not the one coming back for you 
 She's not the one coming back for you 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna help me back up again 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna be my friend 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna help me back up again 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna be my friend 
 It takes disaster to learn a lesson 
 You're gonna make it through the darkest night 
 Some people betray one and cause treason 
 We're gonna make everything alright 
 Well the worst of times, now, they don't phase me 
 Even if I look and act really crazy 
 I went way down, she betrayed me 
 Now my vision is no longer hazy 
 I'm very lucky to have my crew 
 They stood by me when she flew 
 I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue 
 She's not the one coming back for you 
 She's not the one coming back for you 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna help me back up again 
 If I fall back down, you're gonna be my friend

 It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square 
 A hard line - It's the one you gotta cross 
 The one you gotta cross, to get you anywhere 
 Michael's on his way to payback syndication 
 Of fisticuffs retired and his backstreet education 
 The 8-ball stops him low 
 Then the enemy's faces show 
 It's crystal clear, it ain't so clear 
 For folks who become broken in here 
 I got none 
 I got no mind for... nothing 
 I got no insight, I got no feelings 
 I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here 
 The cocaines out, then his world goes down, the prime objective is fear 
 To rival forces from different times and places nowhere near 
 The tension begins to grow 
 His instincts tell him so 
 He jumps I jump I watch a punk and its another splatter oh yeah 
 I got some hard times, two punks upon a subway 
 It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square 
 A hard line - It's the one you gotta cross 
 The one you gotta cross, to get you anywhere 
 Mike gets whipped, his bull-face slapped around a cheap cigar 
 His gang comes in 'cause they're always seeing the trouble from afar 
 He acts so apropos 
 Allusions at his door 
 He makes his point then jumps the joint 
 To the backseat with that mulatto girl yeah 
 I got some hard times, two punks upon a subway 
 It's a long way to go to get to Leicester Square 
 A hard line - It's the one you gotta cross 
 The one you gotta cross, to get you anywhereOut in the open 
 They ain't gonna hide 
 Police state upon us 
 Prepare to collide 
 They're gonna keep you down 
 Step on your neck 
 Can't move no more 
 The weapon of their choosing 
 Is censorship and war 
 And I can see the line up now 
 Everyone is just partisan 
 You see, one side claims victory 
 But it's just a zero sum 
 Liberty and freedom 
 In quotations spray painted on the wall 
 Verbalized explosion 
 We will come back some day 
 If your ideas are suspect 
 Now you're in contempt 
 Report to the committee 
 No one is exempt 
 And the zealots and crusaders 
 They can't justify with threats 
 And intimidation 
 Designed to terrify 
 Liberty and freedom 
 In quotations spray painted on the wall 
 Verbalized explosion 
 We will come back some dayGood morning heartache 
 You're like an old friend 
 Come and see me again 
 Look up you're in Cleveland again 
 A solid line that never ends 
 I got stories that you'll never believe 
 And I know it, I wear it, I wear it on my sleeve 
 There must be something about you that I liked 
 But right here in the rain, you know, it just don't seem right 
 I always go out, I never hide 
 But in Cleveland I should've stayed inside 
 Testify my love for you 
 And I know it runs deep through your body too 
 From the cold black top to the hot concrete 
 And the old tin van, it ain't so sweet 
 Somewhere in America 
 Through the city at night 
 And you were far from home 
 But you knew it was gonna be all right 
 The unfortunate get preyed on by vultures' eyes 
 Eighty-six cents in these pockets of mine 
 You can take my money, you can take my time 
 But you can't take my heart, it's in the city behindThe ending isn't here (there's somethin' wrong) 
 But it's comin'real soon (I lock, step, I'm gone) 
 I said the feeling isn't fear (there's something wrong) 
 It's just telling you to move (I lock, step, I'm gone) 
 There's a fire on the corner and it's never gonna stop 
 Killer in the neighborhood never got caught 
 I lock up my door, step out and I'm gone 
 Waitin' for the buses but the buses won't come 
 All the docks are quiet (there's somethin' wrong) 
 And there's no ships comin' in (I lock, step, I'm gone) 
 Where there once was a riot (there's somethin' wrong) 
 There's a whole lot of nothin' (lock, step, I'm gone) 
 The stop sign's broken and the meter's goin' down 
 Wild dogs are runnin' themselves into the ground 
 Everything was clear for that moment in time 
 If I don't come back, well throw me a line 
 Well the docks are quiet (there's somethin' wrong) 
 And there's no ships comin' in (I lock, step, I'm gone) 
 Where there once was a riot (there's somethin' wrong) 
 There's a whole lot of nothin'...Bloody Thursday was July 6th 
 The pigs killed three workers 
 Harry Bridges grabbed the mic 
 The city shut down on July 6th 
 The workers were outraged 
 It was a general strike 
 The media claimed that the commies 
 Were taking over and some believed it was true 
 Three uncompromising strikes paved the way 
 Minnesota, San Francisco, Toledo 
 Over and over again 
 The doors are locked and the windows are broken 
 Eddie worked for General Motors 
 He swore he'd never lose his job again 
 A union man who owned his own home 
 In beautiful Flint, Michigan 
 Eddie lost his job and Eddie lost his home 
 So Eddie lost his self esteem 
 Last time I saw Eddie 
 He was living in a trailor park again 
 Over and over again 
 The doors are locked and the windows are broken 
 I believe that Eddie forgave too much too soon 
 I got a letter about Eddie 
 It was bad news 
 Over and over again 
 The doors are locked and the windows are brokenThere's four of us here and that's always worked 
 Good and evil, they don't mean dirt 
 One of 'em naked and one's nowhere 
 One of us went back in the hotel 
 On and on

 Just a feeling, it don't seem right 
 Just a feeling, it don't seem right

 Can't tell Ma I'm homicidal 
 Or about pornos in West Los Angeles 
 Oh but she's got one and only child 
 On and on 
 Just a feeling, it don't seem right 
 Just a feeling, it don't seem right

 Shoot it in the left and shoot it in the right 
 Can't tell Ma I'm homicidal 
 In back rooms on the west side 
 Oh but she's getting her child

 The eye atop the pyramid is open and awake 
 The Pagans hold the rituals and the fire won't begin to say: 
 Division is the new world order. 
 Division is the new world order. 
 Division is the new world order. 
 Come along and tell your sister and your brother. 
 The force of war, dynamite blast 
 Rides on the weak and the poor 
 Don't want to see my brother in pain when the man fights big man's wars 
 Don't know nothing 'bout no red, white and blue 
 Little men, big? 
 Too many win, nobody lose 
 It all comes down to what will they choose 
 Division is the new world order. 
 Division is the new world order.

 Come along and tell your sister and your brother. 
 The conscience of the public can not be put to sleep 
 The conglomerate of the nations has no bounds in which they seek 
 Was it the Mob tellin' the CIA to install/restore this state of fear 
 How many of us wish we were at Jeff Kennedy's hearing say 
 Say: 
 Division is the new world order.

 Come along and tell your sister and your brother. 
 See them try to rule the world 
 We don't know why 
 Why they want to rule the world 
 Cuya? 
 Only white men and black men's..? the white power? 
 The guns of mass destruction, them fighting about 
 Buying the world is only so much money 
 Here they come ? in the knees 
 World wide hunger ? one fear 
 Well gangster treaties who keep us in fear 
 How much more can our people bear? 
 Need no more division 
 Need no more pride and I, I will keep on fighting to keep what's mine 
 We the people speaking our mind 
 And once more, would you say it for me now? 
 Dynamite blast of the force of war 
 Government rides on the weak and poor 
 Don't want to see my brother in pain no more 
 When the little man fights all the big man's war 
 ? Victimize 
 Mental slavery with the clever disguise 
 Our prides on our people must rise 
 Decide your fate

 Been running my whole life and I'm still running 
 Integrity is something you never had 
 Reverence to your lies as a person you're bad 
 Falsified living on the truth you're gonna choke

 It's not a proven fact it's just a feeling 
 Her old man doesn't own her like he did before 
 He once was so clear but now he's a blur 
 I'm not the only one who's not afraid of you 
 The avenue's the same but the people are changing 
 She said she would be there they understand me 
 Her old man doesn't own her like he did before 
 He once was so clear but now he's a blur 
 I'm not the only one who's not afraid of you 
 The homeless child is no roll she played 
 It is real as anything the system has made 
 She's a monument forever standing 
 Inner city exposer can be extremely demanding 
 The pattern is circular as we pass the wine 
 She could no longer live with the lying 
 Her family tried to control her feelings 
 It just gave her new life a deeper meaning 
 Either you shut up or you shut down 
 I'm not the only one 
 You motherfucker 
 I'm not the only one who's not afraid of youGod damn it man I almost had it 
 Stuck in the sewer beneath all the maggots 
 I ain't foolin' I've been pursuing 
 A way to get out of these dirty old ruins 
 I'm checkin' out I'm never comin' back again 
 I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A. 
 God damn it man I almost had 
 It threw me out the door and called me a faggot 
 I ain't done I've only yet begun 
 West Oakland is the place where I'm comin' from 
 I'm checkin' out I'm never comin' back again 
 I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A. 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 God damn it man I almost had it 
 Well I did it again yeah I do it outta habit 
 Well I'm numb it ain't no fun I'm less than zero 
 When you add up the sum 
 I'm checkin' out yeah 
 It ain't no doubt yeah 
 A courtship built from anger is what it amounts 
 I almost had it I almost had it I came so close 
 Man I almost had it 
 I'm checkin' out I'm never comin' back again 
 I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A. 
 I'm checkin' out I'm never comin' back again 
 I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A.I hold the cold steel of my rifle as I dream of foreign lands 
 And I promise myself I will cherish every moment I can 
 But there's ghosts that follow me around everywhere I am 
 When I say goodbye, I try to be strong 
 Now I'm going back to the U.S. where I belong 
 I ain't never alone, the war seems to follow me home 
 No longer an active soldier 
 When I walk down the street 
 I'm shaking hands with everyone that I meet 
 And I watch everyone, wondering what they see 
 Civilian ways are now what's foreign to me 
 I came off a long tour 
 I left this place in two-oh-three 
 May we never forget the sacrifices 
 My friends made for me 
 I live in Marysville, out on the county line 
 And my brother and my mother both visit me all the time 
 And visions of you are always running right through my mind 
 We always talk about what we're gonna do when the war is won 
 We're gonna fix up them old cars and ride them into the sun 
 When I heard you're no longer with us, man I was done 
 Civilian ways are now what's foreign to me 
 I came off a long tour 
 I left this place in two-oh-three 
 May we never forget the sacrifices 
 My friends made for meSet out to mislead, sets out to murder 
 False appearance is everything to him 
 Is he good today or is he evil? 
 In a violent craze, spewing words of madness 
 It could go either way, you never know 
 Conditioned to deceive and that's how he likes it 
 With all the guns going off, who could say no to the guy? 
 Watch out, who's fuckin' next? 
 'Cause Loki's playin' tricks again 
 Loki's playin' tricks again 
 Loki's playin' tricks again 
 Loki's playin' tricks againFriday night we'll be drinkin' Manashevitz 
 Goin' out to terrorize goyim 
 Stompin' shagitz, screwin' shicksas 
 As long as we're home by Saturday mornin' 
 'Cause hey, we're the Brews 
 Sportin' anti-swastika tattoos 
 Oi oi, we're the boys 
 Orthodox, hasidic, O.G. Ois 
 Orthopedic Dr. Martins good for

 Reputation, gained through intimidation 
 Pacifism no longer tradition 
 'Cause hey, we're the Brews 
 Sportin' anti swastika tattoos 
 Oi oi, we're the Brews 
 The Fairfax ghetto boys, skinheaded jews 
 We got the might, psycho mashuganas

 Chutzpah, we battle then we feast 
 We celebrate, we'll separate our milkplates from our meat

 Midnight christmas eve 
 A kid could feel alone 
 I drink my scotch 
 My mind goes astray 
 Midnight christmas eve 
 Starts out in a way 
 I cried when I had no shoes 
 Till I met the man with no feet 
 It's just a 
 Holiday sunrise 
 I suddenly realized 
 I got no alibis 
 Holiday sunrise 
 Relatives of mine said 
 They were born again 
 Fucked up world has made me born against 
 I'm a sinner and my soul should be cleansed 
 I'll take my chances when I'm deadTook the 60 bus out of downtown Campbell 
 Ben Zanotto, he was on there, he was waiting for me 
 All the punk rockers and the moon stompers are out 
 On the corners where they're sparing for change 
 I started thinking you know I started drinking, 
 I don't (really) remember too much of that day. 
 Something struck me funny when we ran out of money. 
 Where do you go now when you're only 15? 
 With the music execution and the talk of revolution, 
 It bleeds in me 
 And it goes 
 Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals 
 Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical 
 Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo 
 The radio was playing, Desmond Dekker was singing 
 On the 43 bus as we climbed up the hill. 
 Nothing incoming but the reggae drumming 
 And we all come from unloving homes (I said) 
 Why even bother and pick up the bottle 
 Mr. bus driver please let these people on 
 Rudegirl Carol was a mini-skirt girl, 
 My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong. 
 With the music execution and the talk of revolution, 
 It bleeds in me 
 And it goes 
 On my stereo! 
 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

 Do you know what time it was 
 When you finally seen 
 All your broken dreams 
 Come crashing down your door 
 They demand an answer 
 And they demand it quick 
 Or the questions fade 
 And then the wasted days 
 Come crawling back for more 
 And I said 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 And who pulls the strings 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 It starts and ends with you 
 The face of isolation 
 Well that's one you recognize 
 Well you can't get straight 
 It's a lonely place 
 And one you do despise 
 Boredom is for sale now 
 And helplessness you feel 
 It's a wounded dove 
 And the hawks are above 
 Blood splattered in a reel to reel 
 And I said 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 And who pulls the strings 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 It starts and ends with you 
 I was almost over 
 And my world was almost gone 
 And in a sudden rush 
 I could almost touch 
 The things that I'd done wrong 
 My jungle's made of concrete 
 And through the silence I could feel 
 My aim is true 
 And I will walk on through 
 These mountains made of steel 
 And I said 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 And who pulls the strings 
 Do you know where the power lies 
 It starts and ends with you 
 Oh, I say it starts and ends with you 
 I say it starts and ends with you!Where's my girl, where has she gone 
 She once was beautiful and innocent 
 I can't believe in what she says 
 I look at her and she looked the other way 
 Disconnected from feeling all right 
 Disconnected and it ain't black and white 
 Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove 
 Disconnected from the country I love 
 I remember you when you we young and strong 
 In your summer dress and legs so long 
 My memories are only for me 
 I prefer them to reality 
 Disconnected from feeling all right 
 Disconnected and it ain't black and white 
 Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove 
 Disconnected from the country I love 
 You think it's over, but you better think again 
 Neither grace nor sweetness, just malicious intent 
 It's you and me baby, so we better watch our back 
 'Cause if we are standing together, we ain't never gonna crack 
 And we took the Greyhound into the night 
 With the city on the left and the country on the right 
 And I knew when I saw you, I read it in your eyes 
 I heard your voice break when we're trying not to die 
 Disconnected from feeling all right 
 Disconnected and it ain't black and white 
 Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove 
 Disconnected from the country I love 
 Disconnected, disconnected, disconnected 
 Disconnected from the country I loveYou

 And I hate you - You're a RattlesnakeI didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite me 
 I saw some better days, from Beijing to Hunter Place 
 A portrait of the sum of the last couple years 
 See I lost an image, an image of chaos 
 All I've ever known is isolation and pain? 
 I'm on the verge of losing everything, every single day 
 In all this deadly drama you know I see myself fall 
 I've been confusing 
 A lost canyon 
 Consuming it all 
 I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite me 
 So I may be antisocial and shy, and yo I found myself a job 
 But I journey and complain, through incredible odds 
 It's the simple things I guess, a delicate balance 
 I never really thought I could make it all happen 
 Now the anarchist kid gives a fuck about you 
 I stood up every single time I fell 
 It's just you 
 It's just you 
 Consuming it all 
 I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite them 
 I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first 
 Just like the wolf before he bites me 
 And I didn't go there, I swear that it was cursed 
 Just as if it was to despite me 
 Yeah!I saw a man get the beat down 
 Took his money and his wallet, left him dead on the ground 
 I saw them gather, celebrate the crime 
 Teaching us the laughter, another lesson of mankind 
 I raised my hand, I got another question 
 If I start to riot, will I get protection 
 'Cause I'm a kid who's got a lot of problems 
 If I throw a brick maybe the brick will go and solve them 
 Oh, yeah, I wanna riot 
 Oh, yeah, I wanna riot 
 I'm boiling up, the city's on heat 
 Red alert tention, you know it's on the street 
 Code blue, the city of the dead 
 Sirens in the night with the lights bloody red 
 See how we do this, see how we ride 
 Throw a brick, light the fuse, dodge a bullet, duck inside 
 A statistic hammered on my brain 
 Branded with another nother pawn in the game 
 Oh, yeah I wanna riot 
 Oh, yeah I wanna riot 
 In front of me, perpetuated 
 Crying in line, I got a burning to be 
 My face is burning, burning so quick 
 Burning like a candle at the end of its wick 
 Well, I turn the dial, I turn the channel 
 I turn it to a arab fighting the eternal battle 
 I need some help man, there is no doubt 
 If I'm gonna go down I'm gonna take somebody out 
 Oh, yeah, I wanna riot 
 Oh, yeah, I wanna riot

 No sleep for the weak right No bet no 
 Rollin' with the punk rockers 
 I ain't lying 
 Fake guns fake bands 
 Fake punk I ain't buying 
 Hit the road 
 All I know 
 Rock and roll ain't dying about fifteen deep 
 We hit the streets low ridin' 
 By the time we made it to New Orleans 
 It must have been half past three 
 By the time we made it to Memphis 
 We were crazy 
 Tonight you're our blanket 
 And you're gonna keep us warm 
 Tonight protect us from the storm 
 He was back causing trouble 
 Time's they're a comin' round 
 Oh no, let me go to another round 
 Tuesday night is when the storm's gonna settle down 
 Had a glance circumstance 
 Don't cause trouble bound 
 She's the one, all alone, I come lookin' 
 Smoke and mirrors as I watch 
 Aw, that girl was trippin' 
 It's no fun lost again 
 To have your heart broken 
 Greed is from a world that is built on hustling 
 By the time we made it to New Orleans 
 It must have been half past three 
 By the time we made it to Memphis 
 We were crazy 
 Tonight you're our blanket 
 And you're gonna keep us warm 
 Tonight protect us from the storm

 Every road can lead ya straight down to fucking hell 
 Rain stopped falling when they had failed 
 Every road can take ya straight down to hell 
 Doing nothing here everyone straight trippin' 
 Happy at times are gone past starts slippin 
 This will be enough to keep me on the road livin' 
 Good every night in a different city I'll be sleepin' 
 Let me know here we go met a girl named Lola 
 Is she here Is she there Drinking Jack and cola, 
 She says, "Tim, where ya been? I got somethin' to show ya" 
 Lola fired off her clothes and started rock and rollin'! 
 By the time we made it to New Orleans 
 It must have been half past three 
 By the time we made it to Memphis 
 We were crazy 
 Tonight you're our blanket 
 And you're gonna keep us warm 
 Tonight protect us from the storm"Well I went south with a case of survival 
 To amend my heart that's paper thin 
 You see, I felt her words and her images filed 
 I'm gonna carry my heart to New Orleans 
 I have no home to go, so I wander a while 
 From coast to coast, from sin to sin 
 From the coldest shores to the warmest islands 
 Been around the world, back to New Orleans 
 Well she's got pride like a million lions 
 She's got a scar on her velvet face 
 She's got a smile like a newborn child 
 She's got a walk, a stoic grace 
 I never slept that night until my arrival 
 I romanticized a long embrace 
 You see, I lost my tongue and burned my Bible 
 But made it back home to New Orleans 
 Well she's got pride like a million lions 
 She's got a scar on her velvet face 
 She's got a smile like a newborn child 
 She's got a walk, a stoic grace 
 Well I held my breath and I swam for miles 
 When all was lost and hell took place 
 You see, it rained all night and the city, she flooded 
 It rained all night in New Orleans 
 Yeah, it rained all night in New Orleans(Repeat 2x) 
 Back down no back down comin' up 
 Rise up no rise up showin up 
 Lock down no lock down comin' up 
 International cover-up 
 What about the state of the union 
 What about the guns they're using 
 What about the kids that don't matter 
 What about a genaral strike 
 You don't know what it's like 
 What's it's like what it's like... 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 Back down no back down comin' up 
 Rise up no rise up showin up 
 Lock down no lock down comin' up 
 International cover-up 
 What about the cage getting rattled 
 What about the international battle 
 What about the kids who are dreaming 
 What about the kid who got stopped 
 You don't know what it's like 
 What's it's like what it's like...My life the blessing 
 Understand my aggression 
 I don't regret nothing 
 It's all been a lesson 
 Me and my friend got the music 
 Like a loaded gun we're gonna use it 
 Tell us we ain't shit I won't listen 
 Try to hit us but you keep on missing 
 I knew the sentence then 
 I knew it was gonna blow 
 Don't say I didn't warn you 
 Apocalypse radio 
 Sometimes I'm a total wreck 
 I want to break someone's neck 
 I get a subwoofer going 
 Four twelves get my blood stream going 
 Never saw it coming paid my price in time 
 It's been ten years or more with all the 
 Battle scars in my mind 
 I knew the sentence then 
 I knew it was gonna blow 
 Don't say I didn't warn you 
 Apocalypse radioSolidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 You said it was nothing I knew it was something 
 I was no surprisin' I saw you cryin' 
 About you - Said now what went wrong 
 About you - Said you can't go on 
 About you - Said it was a long time gone 
 About you - Now your life's too long 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Didn't see it comin', your fears went hunting 
 9 millimeter stops you running 
 About you - Said the pressure on 
 About you - Now you can't go on 
 About you - Now you're long time gone 
 About you - So what went wrong 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun 
 Solidarity love and unity set me free with a bullet and a gun

 Bullet and a gun, bullet and a gun, bullet and a gun, bullet and a gunYou're making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 You're making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 Don killed Anya's father 
 In a brutal sword fight 
 The old man regrouped 
 And came back from the dead 
 You're making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 You're making enemies 
 Like Don Giovanni 
 Well the old man came back from the dead 
 And dragged Don Giovanni to hell 
 So don't fuck with me, kid!For 24 hours on the Ivory Coast, 
 They release soldiers from their post, 
 They dedicate champagne, for a toast, 
 They pay dividends to the country's host. 
 They said, "Tonight, you can leave your home, 
 But tomorrow, but tomorrow, it's gonna be the way of the gun", 
 And the curfew, won't allw you to roam, roam, roam, 
 And the bullets will let you know, when the big dog comes 'round your door... 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Stone-cold killer, 
 (Woooooh oh oh!) 
 Food for the trigger, 
 (Woh oh oh!) 
 I'll shoot ya down, right on sight, 
 If you're out at the wrong time of night, 
 And in a civil war, there's no civil rights, 
 In the dead of day, run for your life. 
 They said, "Tonight, you can leave your home, 
 And tomorrow, it's gonna be the way of the gun", 
 And the curfew, won't let you roam, roam, roam, 
 And the bullets will let you know, when the big dog comes 'round your door... 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Stone-cold killer, 
 (Woooooh oh oh!) 
 Food for the trigger, 
 (Woh oh oh!) 
 And the trenches are dug, 
 And the bones ain't too shiver, 
 The tastes of war, so cold and bitter, 
 And the human race is the face of the killer, 
 And the cost of life is rarely considered. 
 They said, "Tonight, you can leave your home, 
 But tomorrow, but tomorrow, it's gonna be the way of the gun", 
 And the curfew, won't let you roam, roam, roam, 
 And the bullets will let you know, when the big dog comes 'round your door... 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Who is the killer? 
 (Wooooh oh oh!) 
 Stone-cold killer, 
 (Woooooh oh oh!) 
 Food for the trigger, 
 (Woh oh oh!)Yeah! 
 There's something in the street tonight 
 Don't know what it is, but it won't keep quiet 
 Breaking through your masses on your radio brodcaster 
 There's something in the air tonight 
 And it's turning in to a full fledged riot 
 Singin' for a last dance (?) someone tryin' to find the truth 
 Yeah! 
 Oh Nine Lives - I'm gonna come right back for you 
 Oh Nine Lives - I'm gonna come right back for you 
 There's something in the world today 
 Don't know what it is but it sure smells rotten 
 Babylon's burning and the fire seems waterproof 
 There's someone in your home tonight 
 You think you know who they are, but something ain't so right 
 I look a different way and boy they don't feel the same about me 
 Oh Nine Lives - I'm gonna come right back for you 
 Oh Nine Lives - I'm gonna come right back for you 
 And I run and I run, and I ride and I ride 
 And I live and I live, and I die and I die 
 And I know... it was all for you and me [x4]Another lesson has been learned, 
 In this days' modern times, 
 Strangers in the mist appear, 
 Now there's war, all the time, 
 Systematically go and destroy, 
 Commit another atrocity, 
 Aggressors are in their places, 
 Man-made catastrophe. 
 I'm not looking for a fight now, 
 And I don't care who's wrong or right now, 
 So release the dove into flight now, 
 So we can start right now, 
 We can start right now. 
 A small key's gonna open the door, 
 Across the border to a new land, 
 And in the new land a sand storm roars, 
 Under spell and the ghost of a man, 
 A pack of men, they're yours to stay, 
 Their prayers fall upon deaf ears, 
 Machiavelli owns a machine gun now, 
 And I see it in the mask and a puppeteer. 
 I'm not looking for a fight now, 
 And I don't care who's wrong or right now, 
 So release the dove into flight now, 
 So we can start right now, 
 We can start right now. 
 Humanity has no blame in this case, this big game of chess for us all, 
 Hostility explodes in the mess, now your arm got blood all over the wall, 
 And clarity turns to dark, blindfolding prisoners of war, 
 And solidarity, on the razor's edge, boy, what? You're a big puncher now, right? 
 Yeah?... Ha!... Nah... I don't fucking think so! 
 Ha ha ha! 
 I'm not looking for a fight now, 
 And I don't care who's wrong or right now, 
 So release the dove into flight now, 
 So we can start right now, 
 We can start right now.Okay, check this out... 
 It ain't impossible, it ain't easy 
 Opportunities shiftin' here 
 So far the strategy ain't workin' 
 The facts are in, it's so very clear 
 I do what I want, I can't predict the future 
 And those who can, I know that they are lyin' 
 And then the truth can be hard to swallow 
 In a soap opera world leaders are cryin' 
 Correction, I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin' for direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 You can burn a book if you don't like the answers 
 Or join forces with an axe grind 
 U.S.A. protecting your cancers 
 A list of hatred's easy to find 
 And there's a growing sentiment in America 
 If you listen closely you can hear them all 
 Right is right, wrong is wrong 
 And the evil considered bad behavior 
 Correction, I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin' for direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 Bad generations, polarized view 
 No one leaves home to go and help you 
 Watch CNN and then you know 
 US bombs come down and whatcha gonna do? 
 Boom, boom, boom, look around 
 There's no more roof, no more house, no street, no town 
 All shot down, burnt black and brown 
 Electrical meltdown, you hear the sound 
 Of the US bombs all around 
 Oh, it's a shakedown, it's a breakdown 
 Atomic sundown 
 And then you know 
 Correction, I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin' for direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 Correction, I need no direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 I spent my whole life searchin' for direction 
 Let me go just one last time 
 One last timeYou took blood with the wrong crew 
 Now we're through with you 
 You took blood with the wrong crew 
 Now we're through with you 
 Do you remember, yeah 
 Yesterday we stood side by side 
 We were once so close, man 
 Now we are back [?] 
 You took blood with the wrong crew 
 Now we're through with you 
 You took blood with the wrong crew 
 Now we're through with you 
 Is this what you wanted? 
 Oh, you better expect defeat 
 Wanted a war now, yeah

 ...You want it, we got it 
 This is the place where everyone can belong 
 You want it, we got it 
 Kicking up a riot 
 Won't you all sing along 
 Can't tell you where I was going 
 So tired, it was showing 
 Like the wind I'm blowing 
 Every town man, I'm known in 
 You want it, we got it 
 This is the place where everyone can belong 
 You want it, we got it 
 Kicking up a riot 
 Won't you all sing along 
 Some live a life of indecision 
 Strung out in the petty schisms 
 I heard GBH 
 I made a decision 
 Punk rock is my religion 
 You want it, we got it 
 This is the place where everyone can belong 
 You want it, we got it 
 Kicking up a riot 
 Won't you all sing along 
 I sit back and I think it's funny 
 We're so worried about the money 
 Cloudy days are looking sunny 
 So why don't you come and stick with me, honey 
 You want it, we got it 
 This is the place where everyone can belong 
 You want it, we got it 
 Kicking up a riot 
 Won't you all sing along 
 To all our friends 
 By this I swear 
 You want it, we got it 
 This is the place where everyone can belong 
 You want it, we got it 
 Kicking up a riot 
 Won't you all sing alongI ain't worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking 
 I ain't listening 
 Listening 
 How many times did you tell me I was wrong 
 But I didn't listen to you and I only stayed strong 
 In a world where people don't hang on too long 
 I belong - I belong 
 Prove me wrong - prove me wrong 
 I ain't worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking 
 I ain't listening 
 Listening 
 Out come the wolves in the lunar light 
 Final flight, you're wrong, I'm right 
 Talk to me straight, man, but be polite 
 You hear my scream 'cause this one bites 
 I ain't worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking 
 I ain't listening 
 Listening 
 I'm Matt Freeman, I'm coming in quick 
 I got a '64 Merc and a clutch that won't slip 
 I don't give a goddamn what they say 
 I'm born and raised in the East Bay 
 I ain't worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking 
 I ain't listening 
 Listening 
 I take chances that most won't take - right 
 I get knocked down, I won't break 
 Get it clear and make no mistake 
 This town's filled with rattlesnakes 
 Black, brown, white, we're all punk rock 
 We're the kings of the low-income block 
 Worn out sneakers, skinheads, mohawk 
 When we all get together, yeah, the music won't stop 
 I ain't worried about a goddamn thing 
 I hear them talking 
 I ain't listeningYou don't know my name 
 Man, you don't know my name 
 Paint a number on my head 
 Work me till I'm dead 
 I can believe I've wasted 
 All of these years I've tasted 
 A million days and nights 
 All this pain and struggle 
 All for what I ask 
 All the hate and trouble punch 
 Drunk from the punch clock 
 Opportunity never gonna 
 Knock no more blue collar 
 All the unions gettin' smaller 
 One million nights and all 
 The pain and struggle 
 All for what I ask 
 All the rate and troubleIs it you?

 Is it you who's born frustrated?

 American shopping malls, 
 Where a product is sold and bought here, 
 Euthanizing the public, 
 While the dead walk the escalators, 
 They come from the loudspeakers, 
 They hear a subliminal message, 
 An ad entices you, the consumer, 
 And there's no way to find it. 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's been orchestrated? 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's born frustrated? 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Is it you? 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's born frustrated? 
 Is this human freedom, 
 Hedonistic excess? 
 Junky consumerism, 
 Mass-production, toxic sickness, 
 Everyone is wearing now, 
 Plastic masks that they hide behind, 
 Marketing massive sales of nothing, 
 Everything is selling. 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's been orchestrated? 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's born frustrated? 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Is it you? 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Is it you? 
 Is it you who's born frustrated? 
 The arrogance, 
 Lost me with nonsense, 
 Well, it's so aggressive, 
 Yet so repulsive, 
 Well, it's a noxious culture, 
 Of the swarming vultures! 
 And I see an imposter, 
 And he's coming to get you!

 No one is safe here, we're all in danger 
 Through the corridor, I see a stranger 
 Robbin' and ransacking, I see him walking 
 Lock your doors now, I hear him knocking 
 Up to no good, up to no good 
 Like a spark on a wire or a splinter in wood 
 Best intentions get misunderstood 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good [x6] 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
 Quick like a snake, he's good at stealing 
 He'll even steal the plaster off the ceiling 
 Cloaked in darkness, I see him standing 
 Making moves in the night, he's a ghost man 
 Up to no good, up to no good 
 Like a spark on a wire or a splinter in wood 
 Best intentions get misunderstood 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good [x6] 
 Criminals, I understand them 
 Watch your back 'cause we'll come at random 
 Born to lose and you end up in the system 
 He's our friend, now we're gonna miss him 
 Up to no good, up to no good 
 Like a spark on a wire or a splinter in wood 
 Best intentions get misunderstood 
 But that motherfucker is up to no good [x8] 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8Well I drank from Tahweh's songs and I dined on a devil's tail 
 Well I'm the best at selling Christ and I'll see you all in hell 
 'Cause I'm already dead 
 'Cause I'm already dead 
 Well I've been to hell and back one million times 
 And the hurricane came and water all the way to sounds 
 If God and Satan both held my hand 
 They said stay with us 'til you understand 
 'Cause I'm already dead 
 'Cause I'm already dead 
 Well my mother was a whore, she was blind, deaf and dumb 
 Well if you look at me across, well you're gonna feel my gun 
 You see, I lie, cheat and steal and I'll break your fucking neck 
 And you'll curse out my name when you take your last breath

 Books on Thoreau 
 But all I read was maps of the road 
 And I was three thousand miles away from you 
 All the while I was twenty-two 
 What do you do to know who you are? 
 The best way for me to drop out on tour 
 You went to Upstate NxY (New York) to go to school 
 To secure the roll with your parents 
 I got a new perspective on you 
 All the good and bad that we went through 
 I know you better than you know you 
 'Cause I got a new perspective on you 
 I never needed much, I never liked to loom 
 But a gesture can get me from across the room 
 The first night we talked until while the sun caught up 
 Transparent people melting all around us 
 You left in a plane, I left in a van 
 Played nightclub house-parties and auditoriums 
 Saw Germany, England, Italy with my band 
 I know you better than your new friends 
 I got a new perspective on you 
 All the good and bad that we went through 
 I know you better than you know you 
 'Cause I got a new perspective on you 
 Ford Econdlane September '93 
 Driving 10 hours until my eyes are blurry 
 3 packs of Winstons and a bag of seeds 
 Tapes of "x" and a thermos of coffee 
 6 weeks on and 10 days off 
 Then I go back on the road for another show 
 This is all that I've ever done 
 Girl I got nothing to fall back on 
 But I got a new perspective on you 
 All of the good and bad that we went through 
 I know you better than you know you 
 'Cause I got a new perspective on youDon't call me white, Don't call me white 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 The connotations wearing my nerves thin 
 Could it be semantics generating the mess we're in? 
 I understand that language breeds stereotype 
 But what's the explanation for the malice, for the spite? 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 I wasn't brought here, I was born 
 Circumcised, categorized, allegiance sworn, 
 Does this mean I have to take such shit 
 For being fairskinned? No! 
 I ain't a part of no conspiracy, 
 I'm just you're average Joe. 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white

 The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind 
 The vast majority of sheep 
 A buttoned collar, starched and bleached 
 Constricting veins, the blood flow to the brain slows 
 They're so fuckin' ordinary white 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 Don't call me white, Don't call me white 
 We're better off this way 
 Say what you're gonna say 
 So go ahead and label me 
 An asshole 'cause I can 
 Accept responsibility, for what I've done 
 But not for what I am

 There's a power inside every man alive 
 There's a power inside every man alive 
 When I look into your empty pockets 
 The storm is nothing, 'cause it's already here 
 Look into an honest man's eyes now 
 Oh, the only thing you're gonna see is fear 
 There's a power in a union, there's a power inside 
 There's a power inside every man alive 
 There's a power in a union, there's a power inside 
 There's a power inside every man alive 
 There's a power inside every man alive

 What it's like not to have a friend 
 Some make [?] get a foe now baby

 There's a power in a union, there's a power inside 
 There's a power inside every man alive

 A frail hooker, holding her carnal walls 
 Gleaming sky scraper bunker he looked down 
 Laugh hysterically and then he spread around 
 On Hoover Street, then he must be alone 
 The precious little kid cashed the woes 
 Salvadorian girl, she kind of made you spill 
 Her brother Mario got shot 4 times in da head 
 Now see poor Mario, he caught a hot one 
 Through the lung, now he's done so God bless the man 
 Cocaine moved through that system, like a river forever winding. 
 To the last party of the lower class 
 Even distance, just a bunch of kids who don't wanna finish last 
 Now see the market place has changed the weight of the scale 
 You either get out and die or go to jail 
 And your best intentions splinter and frail 
 And a few weeks of promises and attempts to fail 
 It's a glass-pipe murder 
 Glass-pipe murder 
 Oh yeah 
 Glass-pipe murder 
 It's a glass-pipe murder 
 Oh yeah! 
 (Oh yeah!) 
 (Oh yeah!) 
 (Oh yeah!) 
 They kick a bottle of beer and a letter 
 Simple things made Mario feel better 
 You see it falls on you and it falls on me 
 Self-annihilation, catastrophe 
 Two packs of cigarettes 
 For two dollars and seventy cents and a 
 Bottle of wine that's been opened 
 And he said, "Why do I do this?" 
 A shiver through his body like a bottle of CC 
 Not encouraging reality or me 
 He said, "It's who I am baby, back to it." 
 Off the deep end the record changed 
 You see, no one stood up and cheered for him 
 Everyone sat down with something that happened 
 Began... to happen 
 It's an old school dorm mystery 
 And the handcuffs bleed... 
 It's a glass-pipe murder 
 Glass-pipe murder 
 Oh yeah 
 Glass-pipe murder

 Piles of blood, entrails and hair 
 I'm bleeding from the inside 
 From the armageddon outside 
 Disfigured and oblique 
 From the appetite that I seek 
 I'm a hungry cannibal 
 I'm a rabid animal 
 My remains are being scattered 
 I've been bludgeoned, I'm in pain 
 Stomach pains are coming 
 And they strike with demon speed 
 Reaccuring rotting dreams 
 From this place the demons speak 
 My skin exfoliates 
 My patience terminates 
 Unfold to unholy urges 
 Unearthed with urgency 
 The holocaust was nothing

 My name is Tim, I'm a lesser known character 
 I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick 
 Fighting crime in the streets together 
 Down in Oakland 
 Off of West Grant 
 St Joseph relief program 
 A good place where good people get food 
 Help your fellow man, a good thing to do 
 Government agency said be afraid of me 
 I shut your doors down 
 It won't phase me 
 Wolverine came through 
 Left the agent for dead 
 Opened up the doors back up 
 Everyone was fed 
 I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick 
 My name is Tim, I'm a lesser known character 
 I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick 
 Fighting crime in the streets together 
 Do not bill the abandoned buildings 
 It's nice to sleep when you got a ceiling 
 Neighborhood Watch said we gotta put a stop 
 Said we can't have people livin' for free 
 Call the cops 
 Here come the SWAT team and the M-16 
 Shoot the walls in 
 Destroy the building 
 Wolverine was sad and it made him mad 
 Every single cop got a bullet in their head 
 I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick 
 My name is Tim, I'm a lesser known character 
 I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick 
 Fighting crime in the streets togetherDon't ever take away from me my pornography 
 Obviously we don't agree on what's obscene 
 I have the right to choose what I want to see and read 
 Don't ever try to take away from me and my right to privacy 
 Because what I do is no one's business but me 
 So stay in your missionary position 
 I hope that you get bored to death 
 There's no way in hell I'm goin' through life havin' vanilla sex 
 The government is tryin' to get in your bedroom 
 Better lock your door and close your shades 
 Because there could be someone watching you today 
 (Solo) 
 Why do try to make things illegal? 
 Why do we have to be twenty-one? 
 You're so afraid that people are havin' way too much fun, ya know 
 Why do you care what I do in my bedroom? 
 Why do you wanna know how I screw? 
 It seems to me you've got nothing better to doYeah we're on/rhymmes ? imagine that

 We gonna make 'em flee, run 
 Easy, you know it ain't easy 
 Got to make a decision 
 Got to learn to say no, no, no... 
 I burn from inside all the walls 
 A dead man can't hear all the calls 
 Who lives like a sheep in the city concrete 
 Never runs deep and dies from the heat 
 Coppers and hoods, dead man's stood 
 It ain't no good when you're misunderstood 
 When you're rotting in jail, wish you would be 
 Out on the street like Robin Hood 
 All those who fall, those who try 
 Let them go, oh victimize 
 You see you ain't gonna take their power, demise 
 Not in your lifetime see more hypnotized, come again

 Detroit, Michigan on the bus downtown 
 Last night I was fighting on the street 
 But tonight I have a girl next to me in this cold world 
 She brings me heat 
 I got a good feeling in a bad city tonight 
 I got a good feeling everything's gonna be all right 
 Some run some fight 
 I got a good feeling in a bad city tonight 
 Detained in illegal custody spent the night in jail 
 With a drunken priest and a hooker, $500 bail 
 Nobody knew who was who standing in the street like that 
 I hit the ground to make a sound 
 I got a good feeling in a bad city tonight 
 I got a good feeling everything's gonna be all right 
 Some run some fight 
 I got a good feeling in a bad city tonight 
 Bus dropped me off and I had to cough, I couldn't breathe 
 'Cause I got ripped off I couldn't realize by being satisfied 'cause it runs so thin 
 And that's why I'm pissed off we had no money we had time 
 She had the champagne, I had the cisco wine 
 She said do you want to come you better hurry because 
 We'll have hell to payTalkin' 'bout the Moron Bros., tattooed fingers tattooed toes. 
 They're idiots, they're losers, they're scum. 
 Yeah they'll take advantage of everyone. 
 You're a dog, they're your fleas. 
 Yeah they'll do anything just to spread disease. 
 Drink your beer, take your drugs. 
 They will leave you with microscopic bugs. 
 Their company you surely won't miss, 
 When your ashtrays are filled with piss. 
 Talkin' 'bout the Moron Bros., tattooed fingers tattooed toes. 
 They'll whine, they'll bitch, 
 They'll fuck you if your rich. 
 They'll leach they'll latch, 
 They're like an itch you can't scratch. 
 They are the Moron Brothers, 
 Don't get along with others.

 When I look 'round, I only see outta one eye 
 As the smoke surrounds my head, the sauna 
 I hear the voices, but I can't make out their words 
 Saying things, saying things that 
 I got something sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eye 
 I feel unusual from thinking 
 About the underground decay, God help me 
 Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry 
 It's not from pity, it comes from 
 What's been sticking in my eye 
 Got something sticking in my eyeWell, they tell me there's a pie up in the sky 
 Waiting for me when I die 
 But between the day you're born and when you die 
 No one ever seems to hear you cry 
 But as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share of what's mine 
 And then the harder they come 
 The harder they fall, one and all (Oh, oh, oh) 
 I said the harder they come 
 Harder they fall, one and all 
 I said the oppressors are trying to keep me down 
 Trying to drive me underground 
 But they think they're gonna have the battle won 
 I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done 
 But as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share of what's mine 
 I said the harder they come 
 The harder they fall, one and all (Oh, oh, oh) 
 I said the harder they come 
 Harder they fall, one and all (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Break it down! 
 Well, I try to do the things that I want 
 'Cause when you're dead, you know that you can't 
 I'd rather be a free man in my grave 
 Than living as a puppet or a slave 
 So as sure as the sun will shine 
 I'm gonna get my share right of what's mine 
 And then the harder they come 
 The harder they fall, one and all (Oh, oh, oh) 
 Ooh, the harder they come 
 Harder they fall, one and all (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I said the harder they come 
 The harder they fall, one and all (Yeah, yeah-ah-ah)

 She says his power is what's happening 
 Well I'll be sure to be respecting nothing's stopping him 
 And to move up for him about crushing them 
 And I'll kick you plain and simple it's a sin man 
 Leave it to the coroner to detect this 
 And I'm sure the U.S.A. to wreck this 
 He drives a tricked out tricked out tricked out Lexus 
 And he looks at the city says I can take this 
 It's high into a corner where the one leads 
 Well it's so fucking high that your nose bleeds 
 They watch you break the nose out of respect 
 You broke the nose that is correct

 And on top of that junk he's been dealing 
 This time the drugs are you 
 And they'll come through 
 It ain't gonna stop till they get what they want 
 And I say 
 Nobody knows me, I'm all alone 
 Ah yayayayay I gotta go 
 It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over 
 Ah yayayayay I gotta go 
 Have you ever been haunted by your past 
 And it will never let you go 
 Well never never let you go 
 No! I said 
 Well never never let you go 
 And I say 
 Nobody knows me, I'm all alone 
 Ah yayayayay I gotta go 
 It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over 
 Ah yayayayay I gotta goTim sings in this song but if songs are in parenthases () that's sung by 
 Lars and matt 
 This songs about a girl who ripped me off 
 She was dope sick 
 (Dope sick girl) 
 Hit and run she took my money 
 87 dollars gone now she's running 
 (How was i, I to know) 
 That girl could take my heart everywhere she go 
 (Dope sick) 
 Girl got a rig and a ride, she got no freedom 
 Little demon gonna hide inside she's gotta feed them 
 (How was i, I to know) 
 That girl could take my heart everywhere she go 
 (Everywhere,) 
 Everywhere she go 
 (Dope sick girl) 
 There she was at the methadone clinic 
 She drank a coup called it a base coat 
 She swore not to get back in it 
 (How was i, I to know) 
 That girl could take my heart everywhere she go 
 (Dope sick girl) 
 Gotta rig and a ride to new york city 
 Gonna run away gonna watch it burn in the heart of new york city 
 (How was i, I to know) 
 That girl could take my heart everywhere she go 
 (Everywhere) 
 Dope sick girlThis is not Churchhill downs 
 This is not Hollywood Park 
 When the field is wide open 
 I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart 
 Let 'em run let 'em ride let 'em roll down the track 
 Let 'em win place and show, let 'em one dollar exact 
 Six furlongs four phillys 
 Three mares three years and up 
 Who measures up 
 Well I wish you luck 
 Who measures up 
 Well I wish you luck 
 This is not Churchhill downs 
 This is not Hollywood Park 
 When the field is wide open 
 I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart 
 Well they rush the windows and play odds on fave 
 (But the) My starter in 2nd deuces down a bit of give and take 
 Race is a puzzler when they open from the outside 
 It's a hit and run and they look back 
 You can't count on that 
 That's a fact 
 The old men from El Cerrito 
 Who talk about their picks 
 And they talk about all the wins of the great jock leftgit Pincay 
 This is not Churchhill downs 
 This is not Hollywood Park 
 When the field is wide open 
 I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart 
 Every time I come back to the east bay I run into "big L" 
 My old friend Big L he's not doing so well 
 Me and Big L grew up across the freeway from the track 
 We spent may days at the track 
 I see Big L come rollin' up the street 
 On his little sister's pink ten speed 
 He said "Tim, Tim don't you remember me?" 
 "Way back from 1973?" 
 Every time I sse him he has to remind me 
 Like I would ever forget Big L 
 Then he's gone like a flash 
 Then he's gone like a flash 
 Yeah like a flash 
 Ok this is rancid signing off for now 
 Until next time we'll see you guys later...I'm money broke and it's no joke can't cope use the rope this time 
 Knuckle up buckle up the rides getting rough but I will not loose my mind 
 I asked them if I could come in and the first thing they said was NO 
 If I can't come in, that means I can't come back that means I got nowhere to go 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 I'm a hyena fighting for lion share 
 Sometimes the lions share ain't there 
 Absent from political authority an animal I've become 
 Total disorder and confusion is the lifestyle that I run 
 Permit me to do what I want and I will I'm a nomad to travel 
 Concrete, glass, stone and gravel. 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 I'm a hyena fighting for lion share 
 Sometimes the lions share ain't there 
 Every time I turn around it's the same sad story 
 Getting ganked I wish it could end and life's commissary 
 I'm a bad missionary with a wicked message I send 
 Who can I trust in a world of greed 
 When I'm taught to take and not to give 
 Who can I trust when I'm taught to take and not to give 
 I'm money broke and it's no joke can't cope use the rope this time 
 Knuckle up buckle up the rides getting rough but I will not loose my mind 
 Permit me to do what I want and I will I'm a nomad to travel 
 Concrete, glass, stone and gravel 
 See there's nothing you can say that's gonna change my mind, fuck you! 
 I'm a hyena fighting for lion share 
 Sometimes the lions share ain't there 
 Sometimes the lions share ain't there... shitThere was romance in the air for sure 
 There was romance in the air 
 When the autumn sunlight Sharmon Palms 
 There was romance in the air 
 Sitting on the steps 
 Shit-head drunks 
 We had a crew and we called it the skunks 
 Punk rockers, skinhead, misfits and misunderstood kids 
 Me and Ben we spent years 
 By the park trees drinking beers 
 When the center of the universe was a street called Sharmon Palms 
 There was romance in the air for sure 
 There was romance in the air 
 When the autumn sunlight Sharmon Palms 
 There was romance in the air 
 Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 
 Youth was exhausted 
 Some take it harder then most 
 My best friend he crumbled and he withered away (withered away) 
 I went back to the palm trees 
 The safest place Ben could ever be 
 Mixed his ashes with the dirt 
 He'll be safe there Yeah! 
 There was romance in the air for sure 
 There was romance in the air 
 When the autumn sunlight Sharmon Palms 
 There was romance in the airHe was an artist and a writer 
 And a poet and a friend 
 In a man's life he will take a fall 
 But how low he goes, it just depends 
 He's shooting dope in the mens' room 
 At the station Daly City Train 
 Have you ever seen an angel, well I know I have 
 You see, they stay here for a while, then they fly away 
 Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him 
 When he rolled the dice, you know, he never thought twice 
 Never thought twice about being here 
 Some grow up and some grow old 
 But what about the kid who never learned the rules 
 Spent all these years on this earth 
 When you look back it's just a flicker of time 
 Jackyl was one of the ones that perished 
 Yeah, he was one of the ones that was already saved 
 Through all this evil and wreckage, yeah 
 He maintained a sense of himself 
 Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him 
 When he rolled the dice, you know, he never thought twice 
 Never thought twice about being here 
 Some men are in prison although they walk the streets at night 
 Other men who got the lockdown are free as a bird in flight 
 How about the hour in the system that ended 
 In a one-way line, our measures could not stand it 
 Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him 
 When he rolled the dice, you know, he never thought twice 
 Never thought twice about being hereJimmy said he could handle this 
 Oh, he's from Los Angeles oh 
 Jimmy said he could handle this 
 Born and raised in West Los Angeles 
 Dad's a lawyer, Mummy's asleep, 
 Runs down the family can't ya see, 
 One thing seems very clear 
 Daddy's got no connection here, 
 Everything's reject and demanded, 
 Lived your life and think you can handle it 
 Let the dying shorten this Rhythmmmm 
 Let's Go Where the shores are green 
 Let's Go Where the Music's loud 
 Let's Go Cause this ain't no problem, fuck this, fucking tragic 
 I ain't forty, I like your stories 
 Keep them coming cause It's kind a boring 
 It ain't coming you have to find it 
 'Cause all of a sudden you got grounded 
 You didn't care, you just stared 
 At the sign that said all beware, 
 In and Out and said Oi, Tik, Tok, 
 I'm glad you got away of me 
 Let the dying shorten this Rhythmmmm

 Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeahNobody knows where anybody goes 
 But where she got it, I know she'll go 
 You can't chase it, you bought her all that 
 But I never knew she acts like that 
 I don't care, I don't care 
 There's nothing below and there's nothing up here 
 I don't care, I don't care 
 There's nothing below and there's nothing up here 
 Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina 
 Another rainy night, she missed the flight 
 Eighteen chapters she'll need to write 
 Another day of living, she goes to confession 
 I know the Catholic girl was sinning 
 I don't care, I don't care 
 There's nothing below and there's nothing up here 
 I don't care, I don't care 
 There's nothing below and there's nothing up here 
 Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina 
 Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina 
 Sabrina, Sabrina, SabrinaNo God, no truce 
 A fire from the sky rains brimstone from above 
 A whole world implosion got too close to the sun 
 A vein from a power struggle explode into a bloody mess 
 Rupturing the nation's core blushing from the stress 
 The atheists get in line awaiting the coming destruction 
 Religious dogma corrupted and corrupter 
 With a man made of sin leads a full scale invasion 
 Drains the life from the skin's abrasion 
 No restoring order in a full scale attack 
 There's no fucking vision, there's no voice it's all black 
 Then you break down with a villainous call 
 Puss bleeding profusely from the city wallsAnother show with a fucked up promoter 
 Kids sent in by the media controller 
 They arrived in a '87 Ford with a gun rack 
 Case of Bud and stiletto blade 
 It's the kind of show you end up at 
 When you get stabbed by the blade 
 Big business made 
 I wanna go boot 
 I wanna go blade 
 The main controller tried to buy me out but I didn't buy it 
 Some people did and there is nothing I could do about it 
 They arrived in a '87 Ford with a gun rack 
 Case of Bud and a stiletto blade 
 It's the kind of show you end up at 
 When you get stabed by the blade 
 Big business made 
 I wanna go boot 
 I wanna go blade 
 The kids unloads his glock into the urban blight 
 Bullets sprayed the car as we drove into the night 
 We lived to tell the story and I'm goona tell you 
 The State of the Union of the State of California 
 I wanna go boot 
 I wanna go bladeIf you wanna make the move, then you better come in 
 It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin 
 Living and dying and the stories that are true 
 The secret to a good life is knowing when you're through

 Tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below his eye 
 His mother cries, she knows that he is strong enough to die

 Three shots rung out, the hero's dead, the new king is crowned

 Win her to enlightenment and set her conscience free

 Who's been trained by a sick junkie 
 On a mission to get money 
 For a new suit and tie 
 To wear to a reception 
 Where they envy your deception 
 And give compliments and praises 
 To the ones they despite 
 Practicing your smile in the mirror all the while 
 Try to cultivate the style of the bastards in power 
 I know what they're selling 
 'Cause their nervous twitch is telling 
 You're coming off smelling like the pig of the hour 
 I got a lot of people telling me I'm outta my mind 
 And I don't know why 
 I got a lot of people telling me I'm outta my mind 
 And I don't know why 
 My brain was bleeding and my fingers were proceeding 
 Through a notebook I was keeping since the dawning of time 
 Senses were corroded 
 You know that I was loaded 
 You were dealing, I was reeling 
 From the feeling and the madness was concealing 
 It's a siren song 
 People that I trusted would surely have me busted 
 If they ever had a clue what was really going on 
 I got a lot of people telling me I'm out of my mind 
 And I don't know why (I don't know why... let's go) 
 I got a lot of people telling me I'm out of my mind 
 And I don't know why (I don't know why... let's go)Business man come shake my hand

 It was a 1962, Fender acoustic guitar.

 Beat him down with a baseball bat 
 Police retreated the riot scenes 
 In fear of a baseballbat 
 Working class intellectuals 
 Disillusion you for sure 
 Broken dreams in Warsaw 
 Where all the dreams fall down 
 American baseball bat 
 Demolish the discoteque 
 And how many blows to his forearm and neck 
 Till he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death 
 December 13, 1981 
 Who remembers the loaded gun 
 Who remembers the first morning 
 Of martial law 
 Hey, you should bring that Louisville 
 Yeah man, I'll know where 
 Yeah man I'm economic 
 Hardshipped in Warsaw 
 American baseball bat 
 Demolish the discoteque 
 And how many blows to his forearm and neck 
 Till he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death 
 Hey! All alone, bludgeoned to death!Night clubs and one night stands 
 Play a show, then I'm off again 
 This is my life 
 Living on the highway 
 It's all I've ever done 
 All I've ever known 
 Just wanna play one more show 
 Make some music with my friends 
 I am working class culture 
 Seen the bleak side of the American experience 
 Scatter in the streets and show me what you got 
 This is no set of ideas 
 This is flesh and blood 
 Night clubs and one night stands 
 Play a show, then I'm off again 
 This is my life 
 Living on the highway 
 It's all I've ever done 
 All I've ever known 
 Just wanna play one more show 
 Make some music with my friends 
 Opinions are hard to put in prison 
 I tell the truth that won't be told 
 Uprising and rebellion 
 Social change with flesh and blood 
 Night clubs and one night stands 
 Play a show, then I'm off again 
 This is my life 
 Living on the highway 
 It's all I've ever done 
 All I've ever known 
 Just wanna play one more show

 Down at the state house 
 Got a gun to my head from the hand of a man 
 Down at the state house 
 Well I reach for a dollar in the hole in my pocket 
 Down at the state house 
 They said I got some rights and I really shouldn't knock it 
 Down at the state house 
 What can we do? [x7] 
 Broken bones, broken rules 
 They can all be fixed (oh yeah) 
 So let those who battle with the pen 
 And the others with the fist (it's the gospel now) 
 The strong ones will be defiant with words that can convince 
 You can take this as rules but I'll take it as a dis 
 Yeah! 
 Well they wanna hold me with wrongful suspicion 
 Down at the state house 
 And I'm all bundled up in an awkward position 
 Down at the state house 
 And they say it's all part of a hundred year tradition 
 Down at the state house 
 And I do feel they got a mental condition 
 Down at the state house 
 What can we do? [x7] 
 Hey gettin' crazy watch me 
 Was it you all along working for the CIA?

 Hey Marky: Go get your fuckin' shine box!Let's go down town, tell me what you're seeing 
 Tell me what it's like to get that old, cold feeling 
 Spend all night just looking at the ceiling 
 Living in a blown out hotel building 
 All the machines are broken down 
 It's a narrow path between evil and good 
 Watch the strong man in his decline 
 Another man dying is misunderstood 
 All I see is damnation 
 Whole world's gone to hell 
 Don't see things the way they were 
 Only see things the way they are now 
 Realize now that it's gone too far 
 Look into the eyes of the dead and gone 
 Now all the machines are broken down 
 It's a song and dance between evil and good 
 Early stages of final decline 
 All alone, misunderstood 
 Whole world's gone to hell 
 All I see is damnation 
 Whole world's gone to hell 
 Whole world's gone to hell 
 Whole world's gone 
 Whole world's gone 
 Whole world's gone 
 Whole world's gone to hellKick the kick drum increase the weight of the sound 
 The dialog of maximum decibles is enough to move the fucking ground 
 I'm gonna amplify the rage of a class 
 That's thought inferior the message in the volume 
 This song's a carrier 
 Unwritten rules 
 Rules understood 
 Unwritten rules 
 Boomin' out the speakers and amps in the hood 
 I like to drink beer play music and go to shows 
 It's not about paying your dues if you do it out of love

 Oh don't you know 
 So on your marks and stand by 
 Ready, go 
 From London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo 
 I see visions of her everywhere I go 
 What have I become? 
 Now that I'm all alone 
 I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and 
 I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and 
 Is anybody out there got a soul? 
 'Cause I'm just looking for a girl 
 The girl with a heart of gold 
 She over turns once again count with her champagne case 
 She goes straight down the rathole with her 
 Total recklessness and 
 Tomorrow will come on through 
 And I got nothing but a sillouette girl 
 Met her in darkness 
 I say 
 What have I become? 
 Now that I'm all alone 
 I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and 
 I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and

 The girl with a heart of gold 
 I said I'm just looking for a girl 
 The girl with a heart of gold 
 Yeah I'm in the corner I start over 
 I start the whole slate clean 
 All the pain and heartache in all my years 
 I was always to blame 
 And I dream of this girl 
 Yeah an angelical ghost 
 I met her in my neighborhood 
 I'm a downtown member? 
 Don't let me be misunderstood 
 Oh, I'm a downtown member? 
 Don't let me be misunderstood 
 Heart of gold! 
 I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and 
 I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and 
 Is anybody out there got a soul 
 'Cause I'm just looking for a girl

 BreakdownIn the army of Babylon I'm a young Al Capone 
 My self an outlaw in the eyes of the Lord 
 Good man lose and the bad man win 
 The blind and the sick I attenuate them 
 Barrels of concrete and melted steel 
 Black smoke rises like a ghost in the field 
 Hardened lungs deep breathing the air 
 That stings the life from within me 
 Succobus catches on and it won't let me go 
 The leprosy sets in and you got no glue 
 The 3rd world working on the factory floor 
 It's so dark in there you can't see the sun no more 
 Cold and burnt are frostbitten hands 
 That leaves you like a flower that's been pulled from the sands 
 Rabid dogs chewing at my feet 
 Trying to protect their side of the street 
 Army of Babylon, young Al Capone yeah 
 Army of Babylon, young Al Capone yeah 
 Young Al Capone yeah (young Al Capone yeah)

 Hopeless atmosphere, steel gates spear it

 Ok Tim take this one home...!Hey ho, let the bombs blow 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I ain't got control (x2) 
 No control of destiny 
 Wake me up to reality 
 I can just see anarchy 
 And there ain't no telling 
 Who's in charge here 
 Hey ho, let the bombs blow 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I ain't got control (x2) 
 Dead men, they tell no tales 
 Satan finally broke out of Hell 
 And everybody's got something to sell 
 'Cause there ain't no good 
 That I can see here 
 Hey ho, let the bombs blow 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I ain't got control (x2) 
 People going crazy, situation Code Red 
 And the whole world's out of control 
 The walls and the fences are being torn down 
 And the bodies of the murdered are getting cold 
 Wild dogs gone mad 
 Smell the blood of their own kill 
 The weakest of the pack 
 Nothing is the way that it seems around here 
 Very clear, it's a very deadly trap 
 Let the dominoes fall 
 I ain't got control (x2)I could not fit in 
 I was the one who got caught 
 I was the one who got realized 
 I was the one who got dropped 
 Shut out banished and locked away 
 The knife that did me in I was carry to this day 
 Rejected 
 Crossing the bridges in the land of the forgotten 
 Rejected 
 Distrust existed that I never saw 
 Deep seated trust I was a victim of 
 Rejected... 
 Unspoken among the more privileged or the so called 
 I was not good enough not good enough at all 
 At first out of lonliness I tried to conform 
 But all that bullshit just left me all alone 
 Left me all alone, yeahPick me back up just to throw me back down 
 Apologies too late when you're up against the wall 
 Compassion heals while duplicity kills 
 You say that I'm different, you say that I'm different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you 
 You moved up the ladder at very rapid speed 
 We moved methodically and calmly 
 When you got to the top you see enemies 
 You say that I'm different, you say that I'm different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you 
 If I knew back then what I know now 
 That it would all turn out like this 
 I'd sit back and I'd watch you squirm 
 'Cause you say I'm different, you say I'm different man 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about youRealize you're 
 Dehumanized you 
 Criticize your existence 
 It's your demise when no sun arise when you're 
 Paralyzed by your lack of resistance

 Only the sort that has never been kissed 
 Let us adore our beautiful son 
 He's ridin' on the rivers of Babylon 
 Burnin' up, shootin' up bring on the brightness 
 See the son of god is comin' up and there is a likeness 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin' 
 When you're brought up you're caught up in a system that's goin' 
 No one answers no one takes that call from you 
 Junkie man tell me what your story is... 
 What do, what do, what do, what do I desire 
 Some parent's house is on fire 
 Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground 
 The neighborhood will watch without a sound 
 Will someone be a witness please tell me that he's crazy 
 But he's not and they know that and they can't get him 'cause he's not crazy 
 Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority

 I make love to my transistor, my transistor 
 And my transparency from the balcony 
 I looked out on the big field, on the big field 
 It opens like the cover of an old bible 
 And out come the wolves, out come the wolves 
 Their paws trampling in the snow the alphabet 
 I stand on my head and watch it all go away 
 Burnin' up, shootin' up bring on the brightness 
 See the son of god is comin' up and there is a likeness 
 Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin' when 
 You're brought up and caught up in a system that is goin'Everybody wants to come now but no one wants to pay

 A story bought a one story house that 
 Let's the winter bleed 
 21 years old and no money to read 
 How did she know the roof would cave in 
 Over and over again 
 Beat up bruised a record that's broken 
 Adina's crying again 
 Beat up chevy with a trailer in town 
 Is what they call home now 
 One more hill or river to cross on 
 On the way to another town 
 Crying in her beer and always running away 
 May be not so much running but hopin' 
 For better days 
 How did she know the roof would cave in 
 Over and over again 
 Beat up bruised a record that's broken 
 Adina's crying again 
 (Repeat 4x) 
 Hey Hey 
 She's crying againEvery city got an artery where the blood breaks down 
 An avenue or a boulevard and a boy who wears a crown 
 Indigant live styles mplies simply lack of means 
 Dogmatical authoritarians dictate the cities remains 
 A promise 
 To go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on me 
 When the factory shut down so did the place he lived 
 Blood money for junk bonds by a white collar fugitive 
 All the tax free insentives ain't goin' to help him now 
 Generations of job security gone out like the horse and plow 
 A promise 
 To go to heaven won't put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on me 
 My old man worked his troubled life in a nowhere dead end 
 He drank the pain away I'll be damned if that's me having my dreams robbed 
 The working class carries a country that has been rotting inside for years 
 The rigs cuffed my old man in the front yard I saw through my eyes of tears 
 A promise to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 
 Whirlwind is coming down on meNo, woman, no cry; 
 No, woman, no cry; 
 No, woman, no cry; 
 No, woman, no cry. 
 Said - said - said: I remember when we used to sit, 
 In the government yard in Trenchtown. 
 Oba - obaserving the hypocrites, 
 As they would mingle with the good people we meet. 
 Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost, 
 Along the way, yeah! 
 In this great future, you can't forget your past; 
 So dry your tears, I seh, yeah! 
 No, woman, no cry; 
 No, woman, no cry. 
 Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears: 
 No, woman, no cry. 
 Said - said - said: I remember when-a we used to sit, 
 In the government yard in Trenchtown. 
 And then Georgie would make the fire lights, 
 As it was logwood burnin' through the nights. 
 Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, 
 Of which I'll share with you; 
 My feet is my only carriage, 
 So I've got to push on through. 
 But while I'm gone, I mean: 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 I said, everything's gonna be all right-a! 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 Everything's gonna be all right, now! 
 Everything's gonna be all right! 
 So, woman, no cry; 
 No - no, woman - woman, no cry. 
 Woman, little sister, don't shed no tears; 
 No, woman, no cry.

 Fifteen years till his liver exploded 
 What's Bob gonna do now that he can't drink? 
 The doctor said, "hey, what were you thinkin' 'bout?" 
 Bob said, "That's the point, 
 I wasn't thinkin' 'bout nothing 
 Now I gotta do something else," 
 Oi Oi Oi 
 "To pass the time." 
 He went and shaved his head. A new identity. 
 12 holed Doctor Martin boots 
 And a girl who rides a scooter 
 Gonna take him out, of town 
 They would get around 
 Riding around, as the trucks drive by 
 You could here the mother fuckers go... 
 A couple of lines, an extra thermos of Joe 
 He'll be kickin' in heads at the punk rock show 
 Bob's the kinda guy who knows just 
 Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what to do 
 When the doctor tells him to 
 "Quit your drinkin', all the time." 
 Will he ever walk the line? 
 To all my friends, I feel fine 
 But will he ever walk the line 
 Kickin' ass, bustin' heads 
 Country boy records 
 Once a day he shaves his head 
 But will he ever walk the line? 
 But will he ever walk the line? 
 But will he ever walk the line?

 A concurrent playback 
 '57 Chevy with the radio on 
 It's a sad song that goes on and on 
 It's a fugitive of time 
 Radio Havana 
 A friend just said you gotta make a choice 
 He's got the leather skin and a velvet voice 
 The New York Times read that it ain't over yet 
 No, they can't forget, 'cause they'll never forget 
 Yeah, I got it right 
 Going down tonight 
 Oh, and where'd ya go 
 Going down below 
 Buenas tardes señoras y señores, bienvenidos a Radio Havana. Hoy 
 En nuestro programa, desde estados unidos le damo la bienvenida a 
 La banda de punk rock de mayor exito: Rancid.Rwanda, oh your moon shines bright 
 Rwanda, overplanned genocide 
 Rwanda, oh won't you be strong 
 Yeah, like a lion 
 Tune in the transistor and listen to the news 
 'Cause once a week it hits your heart broken and blue 
 It's the voice over Africa, so stop peregrination 
 Listen very closely to a half a million dead souls 
 Rwanda, oh your moon shines bright 
 Rwanda, overplanned genocide 
 Rwanda, oh won't you be strong 
 Yeah, like a lion 
 It's complicated when facts come slow 
 Mass destruction, mass confusion 
 What's the difference to the orphan, orphan of the dead? 
 When no more machine guns striking and there's silence instead 
 Rwanda, oh your moon shines bright 
 Rwanda, overplanned genocide 
 Rwanda, oh won't you be strong 
 Yeah, like a lion1951 small town kids got nothing to do 
 But dream all night of movie stars and Cadillac cars 
 And beautiful girls and big city lights 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 From every corner of this great old nation 
 Good kids succumb to the depths of temptation 
 Homecoming queens get lost in the cracks 
 And quarterback heroes get strung out on smack 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 You wake up one day with a monkey on your back 
 With foil on all your windows and you're hiding all your tracks 
 The sheriff's shotgun don't make a sound 
 When it's pointed at your corpse after he shot you down 
 LA River dragnet coming down 
 LA River dragnet coming downYou said protect me

 Now I'm all alone(Tim:) 
 Did I mention to you about my punk rock radio? 
 Words don't apply on my push it up stereo 
 Transistor party, but the fader's right 
 They're gonna speak, come and blast it on a reggae, all the night 
 Whoo! 
 Sham 69, roots reggae on my temple 
 With a 45 record too, on the turntable 
 With the turntable kicking, man, it took away, yeah 
 When the sun come a rising and let the song begins 
 Singing! 
 We're on a mission, got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour, collision course 
 (Lars:) 
 With the glow of the light on my radio dial 
 For better beats from the record file 
 I dropped the needle watching creetons drop 
 While I'm playing Pac-man at the record shop 
 Deep in the night and the chaos comes 
 My rhythm gets driven by the beat of drums 
 45, 33 RPM, 
 Hey, Mr DJ, let us in! 
 (Tim:) 
 Check it! 
 We're on a mission, got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour, collision course 
 We're on a mission, got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour 
 We're on a mission, got no remorse 
 One hundred miles an hour, collision courseCar lights flash my eyes 
 Blinded, hypnotized 
 Lord knows I'm living and I'm never coming back 
 Now one generation dies, next one wins the prize 
 And that's the big surprise 
 There's demise in all of their lies 
 It's never too late to realize 
 That's just the way things are 
 That's just the way it is now (x2) 
 I walk through the cemetery, it's all empty 
 Now I put a rose on the grave of a fallen hero 
 And I look out into the wild 
 All I see is emptiness, so much loneliness 
 I just want forgiveness 
 That's just the way things are 
 That's just the way it is now (x2) 
 When dreams fade away, it won't be long 
 End up singing the same old song 
 What went right, what went wrong 
 Bad times here, good times gone 
 First rule - they always sell 
 Second rule - never tell 
 Third rule - straight to hell 
 White collar criminals living in jail 
 It's all that they gave 
 Sold your soul to get paid 
 But you end up in an early grave 
 Your own neck, you can't save 
 It's a letter that you can't send 
 It's a wound that will never mend 
 Pain level peaks at ten 
 Some stand out, some stand in 
 That's just the way things are 
 That's just the way it is now (x2)This is where the good times went 
 With his brains lying on the pavement 
 With a broken bottle in his hand 
 And another in his back 
 Do you feel all right? Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 Someone's gonna die tonight 
 Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 Do you feel all right? Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 The boys are out tonight! 
 Was it something that he said? 
 With his footballscarf now stained red 
 With a broken bottle in his hand 
 You will never understand 
 Do you feel all right? Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 Someone's gonna die tonight 
 Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 Do you feel all right? Oi! Oi! Oi! 
 The boys are out tonight!Always outnumbered, never outgunned

 That take up where explanations leave off 
 Some of these revelations will very well go against things you have been taught

 Stuck it in some fucked up kid, stayin here and not musclin' 
 I seem to spray paint, jet spray on the brick wall 
 An' I always remember how he said Lonely no More! 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 Sometimes you need something, need to turn it off 
 I went to college, I'm no proper knowledge 
 I've seen the spray paint jet spray on the brick wall 
 I'll always remember how he said... Lonely no more! 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 I say... That's only entertainment 
 Said liquor stores fucked the American prices 
 I said time never stopped, stopped in front of me 
 He shared three pieces of wisdom 
 I'll always remember how he said 
 Lonely no more

 This place is a ghost town now 
 This place has lost its people 
 This place has lost its charm 
 The coals on the fire ain't burnin' no more 
 In the lake shore foundries 
 The workers misled by corporations 
 That knows no boundaries 
 This place is a tale of terror 
 This place is a ghost town now 
 This place has lost its people 
 This place has lost its charm 
 The land of liberty has been betrayed by 
 The monster corporations 
 The monster won't stop 'til 
 It lays waste to everything

 The cops will come out when the sun goes down 
 From dawn to dusk while we give up the town 
 With the closest walk, they don't make a sound 
 Got the baddest of the bad aren't coming around 
 The street is wicked and it's wild and it's free

 It's a long way to go and it's a one way street 
 Kristine with the wild grin, in the future with the world to end 
 You'll leave my heart broken then, one thousand times again 
 You ain't got nothing when you born to lose 
 Your heart filled up with the filth and the booze 
 Standing on the street corner singing the blues 
 The end of the world is the popular tune 
 The city's hot but you cooled it off 
 The city block is another war zone 
 The city kids ain't got no home

 In the streets you're never alone 
 In the streets you're never aloneHold your head up high, 
 'Cause tomorrow you may die, 
 'Cause no one's safe around here, 
 No one's safe around here. 
 Stand your ground, 
 Till you're the last one in town. 
 Someone that you trust turned out to be a tricker, 
 Smoking cigarettes, getting stoned on liquor, 
 Getting really dizzy, only getting sicker, 
 Small problems now only seem bigger. 
 America's a safe place, 
 If you're gonna leave it, 
 And the rhetoric is there, 
 If you're gonna read it, 
 And the hollow masses, 
 The machines defeated, 
 And the rich look down to arrive on the bleeding. 
 Hold your head up high, 
 'Cause tomorrow you may die, 
 'Cause no one's safe around here, 
 No one's safe around here. 
 Stand your ground, 
 Till you're the last one in town. 
 Hardly enough, 
 It gets tough when you're running, 
 So you bust out the homeless, 
 When they start coming, 
 In LA, Broadway, it's wicked when they're watching, 
 And your backup and your backup and your backup ain't working. 
 There's no food, so you're spurred into action, 
 Set up and go to no satisfaction, 
 Ice and snow is the city passion, 
 When you walk in the shadows, girl, there's no protection. 
 Hold your head up high, 
 'Cause tomorrow you may die, 
 'Cause there's no one safe around here, 
 No one's safe around here. 
 Stand your ground, 
 Till you're the last one in town. 
 Skin head Rob: 
 OK, well, 
 This is the city of Los Angeles, 
 And it never sleeps, 
 It may look like it, 
 But it doesn't. 
 It lives and breathes nocturnally, 
 So when you've got no place to sleep at night, 
 And you're all huddled up, 
 And you're cold, 
 Well, this song goes out to the city's forgotten. 
 Hey, Tim, take us on home... 
 Underlying reason, well she can't keep it going, 
 In the middle of the night, 
 They found her frozen, 
 And the Wal-Mart sign, 
 Keeps on glowing, 
 And the winds of change keep on blowing. 
 Hold your head up high, 
 'Cause tomorrow you may die, 
 'Cause no one's safe around here, 
 No one's safe around here. 
 Stand your ground, 
 Till you're the last one in town.Reconciled to the belief, consumed in sacred ground for me 
 There wasn't always a place to go 
 But there was always an urge, a need to belong 
 All these bands and all these people 
 All these friends and we were equals, but 
 Whatcha gonna do when everybody goes on without you 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, yeah 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 Started in '87, ended in '89 
 You got a garage or an amp we'll play anytime 
 It was just the 4 of us, yea man the core of us 
 Too much attention unavoidably destroyed us 
 Four kids on tour 3,000 miles 
 In a four door car not knowing what was going on 
 Not if we got a billion years it would turn out like this 
 Hell no, no premonition could have seen this 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, yeah 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 Matty came from far away 
 From New Orleans, then into the East Bay 
 He said this is a mecca 
 I said this ain't no mecca man, this place is fucked 
 Three months go by, he had no home 
 He had no food, he's all alone 
 Matty said fool me once, shame on you 
 He said fool me twice, he went back to New Orleans 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end 
 To the end, yeah 
 To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the endI figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You didn't see us comin' now there's nothin' you can do 
 Times are gonna change, change or step aside 
 It's my point of view that took you by surprise 
 The sun's comin' up yeah the new dawn arrives 
 New generation standing stand with anger in their eyes 
 No love in the city 'cause there's no connection 
 Been stricken with disease a racial infection 
 I'm a battering ram comin' through to you 
 In every alleyway on every avenue 
 Actions could erase all the fear that we suffer 
 People segregated no one understands each other 
 He's a different color but we're the same kid 
 I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his 
 Well an eye for an eye yeah a tooth for a tooth 
 Brother against brother should be singin' with the group 
 The inner cities burnin' yeah it's screamin' black and blue 
 The power and the passion of a million youth 
 I figured out the problem yeah the problem is you 
 You din't see us comin' now there's nothin' you can do 
 He's a different color but we're the same kid 
 I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his 
 All the blood that spills of all the guts that fly 
 The media paints a picture that stands 
 Pits dogs against cats now who is responsible 
 The power in the issue 
 The force is unstoppableI went to Mary 
 Far to, too long 
 Jubilee was cold as fuck 
 Why do they make it that cold 
 Stand aside while she 
 Picked me for you 
 For the time you gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 I seen you finish 
 I saw you at the start 
 I remember you straight from my heart 
 You'd ask me and I'd say "What'd you say? 
 "You gave me your heart and then you're taking it 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it away 
 You gave it awayWho would've thought that dreams come true 
 Who would've thought I'd end up with you 
 Who would've thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming through 
 Sihlouettes of palm trees backing up against the sky 
 Echo park sunset, an ambulance drives by 
 Someone went down, and I wonder who 
 Faces fall through was it anybody I knew 
 So I drank like a fish till I crawl like a rat 
 In the city of shit I ended up on my back. 
 But I can't believe you're with me after dark 
 So let it come together in echo park 
 Who would've thought that dreams come true 
 Who would've thought I'd end up with you 
 Who would've thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming through 
 A red flag and your body wins 
 Or a snake bite, gotta start again 
 So I'm fucked up and watching TV all day 
 I don't wanna see what ricky lake's gotta say 
 And it hits me when I'm alone, I'm an angry man 
 I start singing to myself I got dealt a shitty hand 
 With all these feelings my heart could explode 
 So is it not fear, no not at all 
 And I said... 
 Who would've thought that dreams come true 
 Who would've thought I'd end up with you 
 Who would've thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming through 
 Who would've thought that dreams come true 
 Who would've thought I'd end up with you 
 Who would've thought what they said was true 
 But it was and you are light and darkness coming throughGo!

 I want nothing to do with your crazy world 
 Broken promises, so full of nonsense 
 Are blanketed by the time 
 I was all abandoned and alone 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanista 
 Lady Liberty, come down and bleed on me 
 You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold 
 Some tenderness, then the cold hits 
 And then I come to find that the streets aren't paved at all 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanista 
 From the conscious to the outside to shout it sandanista 
 From the Kremlin to Afghanistan to our forgotten homes 
 The orphans in confusion, to discharged refugees 
 In the fields of poison ivy, through the famine and disease 
 You bled my loyalty 
 Lady Liberty, come down and bleed for me 
 You want me to believe that the streets are paved in gold 
 Oh, you're telling me, not to worry About the short-comes of lies 
 And the high cost of living

 K.C.'s from Campbell California 
 She's got a reputation 
 That she didn't ask for 
 And she's waiting for an escape 
 Now that escape is called the 164 
 Now K.C. she won't admit 
 Where she is from 
 And K.C. she wants 
 To run, run, run

 I'm in a concrete jungle 
 I'm an individual and 
 You are stuck in a haze 
 Oh hell no 
 She knows where the truth is 
 'Cause she said so 
 And she knows who her friends are 
 So fuck you! don't get no closer 
 It'll only make her run far away

 I knew K.C.'s brother pretty well 
 Lets say we spent alot 
 Of time hangin' out 
 I always thought he said 
 That she'd be the one 
 To get outta here and 
 Make a life for herself 
 But when we found her 
 In the little league park 
 In the dugouts it was 
 Cold, damp, and dark 
 And no one knew why 
 She wouldn't wake up 
 I think she finally 
 Made it back home 
 Under the red hot moon 
 Take the bus downtown 
 To the graveyard shift tonight 
 Under the red hot moon 
 Take the bus downtown

 One time for your mind 
 Two times for your soul 
 Three for the graveyards 
 And the money I fold 
 Dipped out in the city 
 Where the sun burns slow 
 No hope it's a pity 
 I can't say no 
 It's not my time to go 
 It's not my time to die 
 The last thing I want 
 Is for my mother to cry 
 It was love at first light 
 The very first night 
 Things have never been the same 
 Since I took my first flight 
 The way I live my life 
 I love, I live lavish 
 Lost me from the start 
 You lose you'll never have this 
 Untouched, unleashed 
 Back up you don't want it 
 Stick him for his cash 
 His bad its how he flaunt it 
 Take two and pass 
 I'll take two and blast 
 Bust a mother fucker 
 I'm out on the smash 
 Dipped out, high as fuck 
 I'm outta control 
 Lets bounce, rock, skate 
 Man I'm ready to roll!

 I saw an old man on the street 
 He was in a dumpster looking for something to eat 
 He moved so slow, like a dying dream 
 Like a machinist who got caught in the machine 
 I saw this lady and she was crying 
 She said it's hard when someone you love is dying 
 I saw this kid who's about five years old 
 He was in the park all alone, he was cold 
 There's somethine coming around. 
 As wicked as it may seem, 
 As wicked as anything may be 
 As wicked as it may seem, 
 As wicked as anything could be. 
 I know this girl, she's barely alive 
 She's all haggard, she's only twenty-five 
 She said she never had a friend before 
 I said: "Hey girl, I'll be your friend but who is keeping score?" 
 I saw this other little girl on the phone 
 Her mother's comforting her from far far from home 
 The little girl's very hesitant 
 Her best friend lie dead on the pavement 
 There's something coming around, 
 As wicked as it may seem, 
 As wicked as anything could be. 
 As wicked as it may seem. 
 As wicked as anything could be. 
 Nah nah nah... yeah! 
 I always end up back on the hill 
 Looking down at the landfill 
 I always go there when I can 
 My friend Marty said: "Tim, you're a lucky man" 
 There's something coming around, 
 As wicked as it may seem, 
 As wicked as anything could be.

 In another white hidden realm (?) 
 Everybody knows, it's fucking wild and there's no fronting about it 
 It's not the style, nor a trial. It's the best of love and hate 
 Come on everybody, let's get together; I appall the backdrop of hate 
 Well there's no more food on the table 
 What once was strong, no longer able 
 And an open mind, no longer stable 
 And it spin like a DJ's turntable 
 A million eyeballs and a blink and a smile 
 With no dimensions of sight 
 Well within an inch, a billion colors 
 The entire world's contrast light 
 Oh it ain't right, another fight 
 Well it gets so very clear 
 With my passion on a stud, I walk through 
 I walk through the vicious ones 
 And I really don't care 
 Well there's no more food on the table 
 What once was strong, no longer able 
 And an open mind, no longer stable 
 And it spin like a DJ's turntable 
 My western mind has a hard time (hard time) 
 Getting across distrust 
 Passive resistance, Your assistance: 
 You're the one smoking dust!

 A glimpse, I caught a glimpse of things to come. 
 I was jolted, I caught a glimpse of things to come. 
 One that stops, and launches and explosion. 
 I caught a glimpse of things to come.Within the same school. The idea was that we'd later combine both styles, 
 Unify the techniques. 
 But still, we were too young. 
 Too full of ignorant pride in our own succulent sorrow. 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 What you got you can't keep here 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 All their lives are led in evil (? Oh, they rise a lot of evil ?) 
 Open the jails and set the men free 
 Well the devils and witches are looming on me 
 And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery 
 A decision of descention into insanity 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 What you got you can't keep here 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 All their lives are led in evil (? Oh, they rise a lot of evil ?) 
 Humility will hold you and never let you go 
 To all my friends well, much gratitude 
 And to all the wicked, I've got my eyes on you 
 And everyone stands in confusion 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 What you got you can't keep here 
 Oh no! 
 Some people live illegal 
 All their lives are led in evil (? Oh, they rise a lot of evil ?) 
 (To do the job, you've got to prepare yourself to die... die... die...) 
 Put 'em up, put 'em in, run 'em out, run quicker 
 Cool to the breath and quicker than liquor 
 Quicker than any motherfucker that I know 
 Rack 'em up and stomp 'em wherever he'll go 
 Rancid pack, I'm a blast it 
 Blasted lyrics of elastic 
 With a 12 gauge double barrel lyric gun 
 (Go... go ... go) 
 Reconcile with the culturalist 
 Proclamation to the nihilist 
 Down to the propagandist 
 Take me off of that fucking list 
 Open the jails and set the men free 
 Well the devils and witches are looming on me 
 And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery 
 A decision of dissension into insanity 
 Oh no!

 She's my honky tonk girl 
 She dances on my table 
 She dances on a pole 
 Some city's born, some cities burn 
 Some cities die, some cities Learn 
 Some cities take the worst of the turn 
 And if it ain't your business 
 Then it's not your concern 
 Listen, brick buildings 
 Broken windows, smoke stacks 
 Tell me something's broken 
 And there's blood tracks 
 And if you see the train coming 
 You're gonna relax 
 So tell the facts ma'am, only the facts 
 Stand down what you gonna do 
 She's a wild one 
 I'm a wild one too 
 She's my go-go baby 
 She's my honky tonk girl 
 She dances on my table 
 She dances on a pole (x2) 
 Midnight and I'm rolling on 
 Nobody sees me coming home 
 And out here man, a lot of things can go wrong 
 Shhh, listen to my song 
 The morgue is busy day after day 
 Stick it on the line and throw it away 
 And if you see it coming on, then you got it made 
 And the grave diggers laugh as they rot and decay 
 Say it loud 
 What you gonna do 
 She's a wild one 
 And I'm a wild one too 
 She's my go-go baby 
 She's my honky tonk girl 
 She dances on my table 
 She dances on a pole 
 I'm a wild one 
 I'm a wild oneThere's a place where 
 Where I like to go 
 When I got no food 
 Or I got no shelter 
 It's a house where I can 
 Get away for maybe three days 
 To get off the drink 
 And stay off the haze 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Woke up in the bushes 
 6:30 Tuesday morning 
 With a unopened Heineken 
 And a head that was burning 
 For seven years I walked 
 Down the same path 
 Dreams of being loved 
 Was all I ever had 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Let's go! 
 Yeah! 
 Down on Fifth Avenue 
 Kids smoking crack and drinking 
 They say I don't belong here 
 Fuck you, Mohican 
 They call me a faggot 
 And they shove me out 
 But I don't give a fuck 
 I never did! 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Who's the opposition? 
 I'm seven years down 
 The human spirit prevails 
 Oh yeah, I'm down, down, down 
 Blah!Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th Street 
 He knew I was in trouble 
 I was feeling much like the devil 
 There was something burnin' deep inside of me 
 Ran into three Puerto Ricans 
 These girls took us to the funhouse 
 Where we played a lonely pinball machine 
 Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway 
 Cars passin' by but none of them seem to be goin' my way 
 New York City - well I wish I was on a highway 
 Back to Olympia... 
 I'm having a hard time understanding 
 It gets all too demanding 
 She's all gone and I'm stranded 
 Something burning deep inside of me 
 All I know it's 4'o'clock and 
 She ain't never showed up 
 And I watched a thousand people go home from work 
 How many times will it take me 
 Before I go crazy 
 Before I lose everything 
 Something burning deep inside of me 
 Ran into three Puerto Ricans 
 Those girls took us to the funhouse 
 I don't wanna be alone again 
 Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway 
 Cars passin by, but none of them seem to go my way 
 New York City, well I wish I was on the highway 
 Back to OlympiaYeah! Are you ready for this? I told you he was coming. GO! 
 These bands call anywhere living in '66 
 I made so many mistakes when I look back, it makes me sick 
 Those days are dead and gone and they ain't ever coming back 
 Those days are dead and gone and they ain't ever coming back 
 I realize that in life it ain't free 
 I got so many troubles, it brings me to my knees 
 Those days are dead and gone and they ain't ever coming back 
 Those days are dead and gone and they ain't ever coming back1987 at a 7-11 
 Police out looking for problems 
 But I'm no average hoodlum 
 Still running from the pigs 
 So it seems to me this is not 
 The land of love and liberty 
 It's more like a waiting room in hell 
 Drink a qwart and watch me dwell 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonight 
 Glass towers rise above the filth and the pain 
 I'm a moral degenerate feel my pain 
 Pass out in a squat on mission 
 That night I was shocked into submission 
 Straight down straight down to hell I head 
 Systems of sewers is where I lay my head 
 People on their way are like on a different dimension 
 I need no correction 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonight 
 Some of my friends moved on a simple domestic life 
 They磖e all gone only a few of us remain 
 Only few of us want to keep in the same 
 I got it right out in the trenches tonightThe way that she moves 
 Well I was aroused, impowered, impassioned by every move 
 It's so cold outside, we need a place to hide 
 Go into the club to thaw out for the night 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way that she moves, the way that she moves 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way she moves 
 The situation was tricky, I was feeling so proud 
 The bass and the drums, the music so loud 
 She asked me if I would stand by her side 
 And I knew that I would till the end of the night 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way that she moves, the way that she moves 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way she moves 
 My head was spinnin' a million miles an hour 
 The chance I was takin', I get anxious around her 
 She put her head on my shoulder, I started to hold her 
 Swingin' and swayin' the morning began 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way that she moves, the way that she moves 
 She's automatic, so automatic 
 The way she moves 
 I say the way she moves, yeah 
 I say the way she moves, yeah 
 I say the way she movesShe's got her ticket & she's waitin' at the station 
 She's got to get away get away as far as she can 
 Her problems will arise as sure as the sun does shine 
 She's got to get used to living on the lam 
 Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her hand 
 Shootin' down the law that shot down her dear departed man 
 When I last saw her she was lookin' troubled 
 She said this is the 90's I'm gonna be alright 
 She took the Greyhound into Salinas 
 I got a letter then she dropped out of sight 
 Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her hand 
 Shootin' down the law that shot down her dear departed man 
 Shrouded in anger 
 Encompassed by pain 
 He was your best friend & you'll never ever ever see him again 
 Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her handOn the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 It's the lonely asshole with a glimmer of life 
 With the kill all the life 
 Killer don't care 
 Kill we're not going 
 Destroying anywhere 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 I'm gonna breakout, I'm gonna throw down 
 'Cause I already hate you 
 It's just gonna drag me down! 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 On the brinks on the last worst summer night 
 It's the lonely asshole with a glimmer of life 
 With the kill all the life 
 Killer don't care 
 Kill we're not going 
 Destroying anywhere 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 Kill the lights! (kill the lights!) 
 I'm gonna breakout, I'm gonna throw down 
 'Cause I already hate you 
 It's just gonna drag me down! 
 Blah!In the dark with the okland skyline 
 As I cross the city I avoid the landlines 
 All I wanna do is make it through without dying 
 All I wanna do is keep on trying 
 Another night 
 In the streets for me 
 Another night 
 No sanctuary 
 Another night 
 Come and watch me bleed 
 Another night 
 In the streets for me 
 She wouldn't move until the coast was clear 
 She always knew the final battle was near 
 If you have a bag of dope she give it up for free 
 If you got a song of hope it will help her see 
 Another night 
 In the streets for me 
 Another night 
 No sanctuary 
 Another night 
 Come and watch me bleed 
 Another night 
 In the streets for mePick me back up just to throw me back down apoogies too like when you're up 
 Against the wall compassion heals while duplicity kills you say I'm different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you You moved up the ladder 
 At a very rapid speed we mived methodically and calmly when you got to the top 
 You see enemies if I knew back then what I know that it would all turn out 
 Like this I'd sit back and I'd watch you squirm cause you say I'm different 
 The only thing different is the way I feel about you...Go to work, go to scool 
 Get an education, so you won't be a fool 
 Get a doctorate, PhD 
 All that shit is not for me 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life, live it my own way 
 Was so blind I couldn't see 
 Figures of authority 
 Always standing behind me 
 Ready to come down on me 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life, live it my own way 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life, live it my own way 
 All my life people tell me what to say 
 This is my life, live it my own wayNever fell in love 'til I fell in love with you 
 Never knew what a good time was 'til I had a good time with you 
 If you wanna get the feelin' & you wanna get it right 
 Then the music's gotta be loud 
 For when the music hits I feel no pain at all 
 Ya know! 
 One summer night I was drinkin' with my dad 
 He tried to give me love that I never had 
 But he gave more love to his bottle of wine 
 So I had to go out and find love of another kind 
 Here it is 
 Here I am 
 Turn it up fuckin' loud

 Canterbury Tales 
 When three men find a pot of gold 
 And end up killing one another in the name of greed 
 Some people are poison 
 Under my skin like opium 
 I'll stare in their eye to annoy them 
 Well, they're poison, yeah, they're poison 
 Admissions of liabilities 
 I'm livin' in my own private cold war 
 In a room full of spies 
 And I can't find the door 
 Some people are poison 
 Under my skin like opium 
 I'll stare in their eye to annoy them 
 Well, they're poison, yeah, they're poison 
 The violent aspects of the tattered man 
 Let me respond to that if I can 
 Illuminated manuscripts written by hand 
 Accusations have been made from the very beginning 
 Some people are poison 
 Under my skin like opium 
 I'll stare in their eye to annoy them 
 Well, they're poison, yeah, they're poison 
 Yeah, their fuckin' poisonYeah! 
 Here's the new face of rock-n'-roll! 
 It's about fightin' toe to toe... 
 Hard times come 
 Yeah the hard times go 
 When I say, come one, come all 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face. 
 One man's decision 
 Brings anothers opposition 
 Completely unbound 
 Down on the flats 
 Where the seaside meets 
 My lonely young town 
 Well all the rudies and skins 
 Well they're out on the streets 
 Making the way on the grill 
 Between the bottles and sex 
 They smash and they wreck 
 For something to live 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Sometimes you know there's no place to go 
 But to a long life of crime 
 Yeah but it's so wrong to steal 
 Someone's very last meal 
 To profit up a dime 
 Your poe poes and greys 
 Well they end up in jail 
 Gonna swing the cowboys 
 Well you took a bite 
 Outta the apple of decision 
 That got ya there boy 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face 
 Hooligans and rudeboys 
 I don't want no racial hatred 
 Black and white, who are portrayed without bias. 
 These are the people whose voice I want to be... 
 I said the hooligans! 
 Rancid 
 Rudeboys! 
 Rancid 
 Hooligans! 
 Rancid 
 Rudeboys! 
 Rancid. 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 Scars been stricken on their face. 
 Well all the hooligans and rudeboys know one thing for sure 
 (Ah ah ah)He didn't see it comin' until it was too late 
 He had a bad feelin'?, can't hesitate 
 And at the end of the day he was so tired 
 And he looked at the television 
 And whose the fuckin' liar 
 He hates society, he thinks it's to big 
 It's just about killin' a man with his ring 
 And he knew what was happening, millions in gold 
 He's the first on the case and there's a murder to shoot 
 Bright lights, here comes the night 
 Interrogate the kid with the .357 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 Question the ethics, right or wrong 
 Secret identity started so young 
 He never made friends, ah don't get too close 
 For a man who's got nothin', he's just got the mercy 
 His family never knows the truth 
 'Cause he gets caught when he tells the truth 
 No friends to lose or time to betray 
 The rendition from the papers gonna bake him again 
 Bright lights, here comes the night 
 Interrogate the kid with the .357 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 See through his eyes, his eyes alone 
 Intensified anger, can't be controlled 
 He turned his indiscretion, he brought it all down 
 If there was ever force of reason it could never be found. 
 The timing was perfect, this kid he was cleared 
 Computers down, he's clasped his fear 
 A different mind lives in a way 
 It's a good good thing that he got it straight 
 Bright lights, here comes the night 
 Interrogate the kid with the .357 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em 
 I'm gonna - I'm gonna blast em
