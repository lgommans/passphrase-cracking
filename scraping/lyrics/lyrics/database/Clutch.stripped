Make a friend of the coyote 
 He will always tell it like it is 
 Take council the bear 
 Back on the Res reservation 
 When we would sail the phoenix 
 Feather on the sea 
 Thunderbird at midnight 
 Per chance did meet 
 Swallow took the sun 
 From that bitter ground 
 And now we were heavy 
 With the burden of a crown 
 We are the King of Arizona 
 Townies are a helpless people 
 They are busy in their troubled games 
 Damn their parliament of needles 
 They know not a lineage of names 
 We are the King of ArizonaPerhaps its just the way the light falls 
 But everything looks like a target to me 
 And I dont know where the gun is 
 But Im certain that its pointed at me 
 And in the jungle retched jungle 
 They say the lion eats tonight 
 And all around it is a colliseum 
 Dripping with a voracious appetite 
 I say hey there fella 
 Whose soul are you tormenting now 
 Hey there fella 
 In the course of all the previous events 
 It is evident that somethings bound to happen 
 Come on rear your ugly head to me 
 Ive got nothing to lose but my apathy 
 The root of the problem has been isolated 
 Come on motherfucker 
 Lets throw down 
 Just try me 
 What are you waiting for 
 Lets go 
 Just rear your ugly fucking head 
 Ill put it on a platter 
 Hey there 
 Hey fella 
 Ill make you wish that youd never been born 
 Hey fellaI may not got a lot of money 
 But I got selfesteem 
 And in the golden age of travel 
 Thats really all you need 
 I know Im ugly honey 
 But look where Im coming from 
 I got a pony down state 
 And that pony born to run 
 Book saddle and go 
 Hey thats the name of the game 
 Book saddle and go 
 Canned heat thats the name of the game 
 They call me the robber 
 Highwayman 
 Dont wanna hurt nobody 
 Just doing what I can 
 The galley after hours 
 Man the captain just wont listen 
 If you dont turn this boat around 
 Im gonna kick the damn doors in 
 Pinkerton man murdering bastard 
 Im gonna get even get even with you 
 Get even with you 
 You can take that my violin 
 And play it all you please 
 For at this time tomorrow

 Tomorrow Ill be dead 
 Though I never even harmed a hair 
 On anybodys head 
 Pinkerton man you murdering bastard 
 Get even with youSmall upsetters 
 Small upsetters come around the corner 
 Never thought of again 
 Do not bother get on with itAll right well why dont you just go ahead and have a seat right there 
 Heres a pad of paper and pen 
 And uh well 
 Why dont you just why dont you just start at the beginning nowPlease allow me to adjust my pants 
 So that I may dance the good time dance 
 And put the onlookers and innocent bystanders into a trance 
 Give disease so the swine will marry and propagate lies 
 Tough luck for elected officials the beast you see got 50 eyes 
 Bring it on home spread the wealth play it cool the hands been dealt 
 Now all the odds are in our favor save the victory speeches for later 
 Streets on fire the mob goes wild wild wild 
 Streets on fire the mob goes wild

 Letter from the government sealed and signed 
 Delivered Federal Express 
 On your mothers doorsteps 
 Condoleezza Rice is nice but I prefer ARoni 
 And that man on the TV who speaks to the dead you know that mans a phony 
 Everybody move to Canada and smoke lots of pot 
 Everybody move to Canada right now Heres how we do it 
 Bum rush the border guard before he and his dog ever knew it 
 On your mothers doorsteps alright 
 On your mothers doorstepsCouldve been a swan on a glassy lake 
 Couldve been a gull in a clippers wake 
 Couldve been a ladybug on a windchime 
 But she was born a dragonfly 
 In the sun she warmed her wings 
 And listened to the cicadas sing 
 The trees are all bending 
 In one direction 
 Because of something 
 Crosspollination by the legs of bees in the spring 
 Is a beautiful thing 
 Oh when the sun goes down 
 The fireflies come out 
 In a pond crept a slimy thing 
 That hummed a theme from the Rites of Spring 
 Pity the mate of Queen Mantis 
 So content but so headless 
 Katydid nothing but shiver and cry 
 As did the dragonfly 
 In the shade the gypsies spin 
 Among the cloves they drop their skin 
 Beyond the hedgegrove 
 Over by the willows 
 Deep in the shadows 
 Regeneration occurs at a furious speed 
 Beneath the white oak tree 
 Oh when the sun comes up 
 The moon buds fold up 
 And listened to the Rites of Spring 
 Couldve been a swan on a glassy lake 
 Aint ever seen it but I have heard it 
 Sounds like the millstones when they are turning 
 But every moment getting louder and louder 
 And then there is silence 
 And the smell of flowersLike ravens on a scarecrow 
 Too old to beat them off 
 The guilt ferments 
 Familiarity breeds contempt 
 The yolk of faith splatters silent 
 Harvest time red moon rising 
 Anvil cloud lightning rod 
 Peacemaker life taker 
 Whats inside the silo 
 Can it fly 
 A needle in the haystack 
 To crack the sky 
 The yoke of faith breaks away 
 From the beast of burden 
 Peacemaker 
 Life taker 
 The feet of marching men 
 Beat down the fields of last chances 
 As scarecrows in amber waves of grain 
 Grin exchanging glances 
 Weve killed it 
 Killed itBack again with a quickness 
 Pick it up pick it up 
 Master arithmeticness 
 Light it up light it up 
 I got the heat in both feets 
 Snake handlers hands 
 Come back with slickness 
 And do it all again yeah 
 My subtle hustle smooth as mothers butter 
 I let it ride on I let it ride on 
 Now Im the media darling 
 An international phenomenon 
 I cause eclipses 
 With a wave of the hand 
 Let them hang in ellipses 
 I got your number I steal your thunder 
 I got your mothers maiden name tattooed on my arm 
 I drive out demons 
 Can I hear an Amen 
 Lay hands on screaming heathens 
 Let it ride on 
 Let it ride onI have suffered 
 For your sins 
 But now is when 
 My fun begins 
 If I hit you 
 Turn your cheek 
 You are righteous 
 But you are weak 
 OrgyPorgy Ford and fun 
 Kiss the girls and make them One 
 Boys at one with girls at peace 
 OrgyPorgy gives release 
 American dream 
 Turns to dust 
 So give us a god 
 That does not rust 
 Points of light 
 Quickly fade 
 You are food 
 But you are saved 
 Juggernaut 
 This is it 
 Weve reached the border 
 The New World Order 
 If I die 
 Before I wake 
 I pray the Order 
 My soul to take 
 OrgyPorgy gives releaseThank you for taking time out of your day 
 Your responses will allow us to serve you in a better way 
 Did you not take into account Im an uncivilized man 
 Unapologetic lifer for Rock and Roll 
 Ten words or less can you describe yourself 
 Your religion your politics your general health 
 Did you not take into account Im a noble savage 
 Its been a blast discussing my lifestyle 
 But as you can see I got styles for miles 
 Did you not take into account Im a sophisticated man 
 Unapologetic lifer for the Rock and RollIt was the morning of All Saints Day 98 
 When that old blind dog started roaming around the graveyard 
 Wouldnt have bothered me so much 
 Were he not walking on his hind legs and smoking cigars 
 Recite my lineage and genealogy 
 Youve got to know your history Son of Virginia 
 Everybodys in the church believing theyre a sinner 
 And looking for a sign from the True Son of Virginia 
 When the storm blew over we made our way 
 To the old hay wain to infiltrate the sarcophagus 
 By the dim light of a narrow window we saw 
 The Gods honest truth staring right back at us 
 Recite your lineage and genealogy 
 Stare into the embers on the first of November 
 And remember you were born a True Son of Virginia 
 I was thrown to the ground as my world broke asunder 
 Truly we are living in an Age of Wonder 
 It was the morning of All Saints Day 98 
 When that old blind dog started calling me associate 
 Wouldnt have bothered me so much were it not for the fact 
 That was the truth of it 
 Recite our lineage and genealogy 
 I wept like a child as the son rose above her 
 Truly we are living in an Age of WonderOnce again Im denied my choice 
 Once around the stump then twice across the ceiling 
 Now eight times over Miss October is out for me 
 Believe me when I tell you shes all about destruction 
 Its just about enough to make a grown man cry 
 Good God Almighty we was panning for gold 
 Down at the banks of mighty Colorado 
 When all of a sudden came an awful sound 
 Ten thousand buffalo were running us down 
 Once again Im denied my joy 
 Sieves and peas oh Lord oh Lord 
 Thunder and lightning at a feverish pitch 
 Must be the workings of the Old West Witch 
 I crossed her once when I was just a youth 
 Been scared stiff ever since to tell you the truth 
 She went once around the stump then twice across the ceiling 
 Believe me when I tell you shes all about the voodoo 
 And all the things Im losing when I pay no mind 
 Get off on the good foot and start another day 
 Maybe head for Hazel California 
 Oh but sooner or later shell go to town 
 Sure as the Earth runs around and around 
 Again Im denied my joy 
 Sieves and peas oh Lord 
 At the side of the road 
 A bundle of twine 
 And on it I found a note 
 It read Youll be running until the end of time 
 Its just about enough to make a grown man cryOh I seen him walkin 
 On down that road 
 He got a broken push cart 
 With a heavy load 
 Oh Lord have mercy 
 Upon my wicked soul 
 Ah he looked right at me 
 With his eyes of coal 
 Its the hoodoo operator 
 Hoodoo operator 
 Ah hell sell you liquids 
 To cure that whooping cough 
 And fine liniments 
 At a poor mans cost 
 Ah but when your time is up boy 
 And you feel that chill 
 He will come softly knocking 
 To collect his bill 
 Oh I seen him walkin 
 He got a broken white man 
 Upon my foolish soul 
 It is so cold and dark 
 Behind these eyes of coal 
 Operate 
 OperateFor Thanksgiving we had tatas 
 Succotash and rudebagas 
 Then came turkey from the oven 
 Broke the wishbone 
 Covenants were sealed and set 
 On the losing end of a wishbone 
 And I wont pretend not to mind 
 Christmas Eve we ate at Auntys 
 We had some ham glazed with honey 
 Rolled the Yule log on the fire 
 Threw the hambone to the dogs and went to bed 
 In the morning the weathercock was heard 
 Asking what he had learned of the Earth 
 Is it a round place with deserts and oceans 
 Housing as many winds as one might wish 
 We were standing by the gate 
 He said Oh my its getting late 
 Then he took off flying to the south 
 With a black snake in his mouth 
 You can shake it break it or glue it whole 
 But theres no two ways about it with a broke wishbone 
 On the losing end 
 For St Patricks we had cabbage 
 Corned beef stew egg salad sandwich 
 Then came the whiskey from the basement 
 Danced all night into the dawn 
 Then held our heads 
 And I wont pretend not to mindDig a slow hole to China 
 Like a Bangkok miner 
 No turn unstoned I tremble 
 Hold my candles handle 
 Mama always said 
 You better come home 
 Stuck in the mud 
 Dug a slow hole 
 My blue cow 
 Gotta get her back here somehow 
 My brown bag 
 Never gonna guess what I have 
 If its too shallow then dig it more deep 
 If its too narrow then dig it more wide 
 If you see a point of light 
 Shake hands with the other side 
 If you see the point of light 
 A lighthouse in Kentucky 
 Oh I should be so lucky 
 Sell fill dirt to the groundlings 
 And water to the drowning

 But while we still have the time please tell me 
 Witchdoctor Witchdoctor 
 With Babylonian passion they built a bridge to the sky 
 Loaded it up with Mother Earth never got to asking why 
 In Babylonian fashion that bridge fell down from the sky 
 And they spent the next five thousand years 
 Scratching their heads and wondering why 
 Abundance in the end times song and Praise 
 The dough and the dead will both will be raised 
 The Word The Law Armageddon in America 
 But why we still have the time please tell me

 Aint around anymore 
 Big ol stone big ol stone

 Tyrannosaurs tyrannosaurs 
 They came crashing down and moaned aloud

 HaleBopp wont you 
 Leave us aloneHey hey now whats that smell 
 Just like cornbread done too well 
 What you need you know I got 
 So hands up who wants to rockI was eating dinner at the table with people from the music industry 
 They asked me if I liked it in The City I said I liked it better in the country 
 The label representative asked me what about it most appealed to me 
 I love to listen to the yellowhammer singing a little bit of bread and no cheese 
 Then I commenced to do a tap dance on eggplant Parmesan before their eyes 
 Guided by voices whole bag of tricks Raised by Druids and Horses 
 Then I told them 
 Never underestimate the power of Love You dig my new horseshoes 
 Never underestimate the power of Love 
 Come here quickly hes lost his mind 
 Frightened Well Im not surprised youve never seen the likes of me 
 Check it I want a big fat advance and my alfalfa free 
 The manager removed me from the restaurant A crowd got to gathering around 
 I said You can throw a man out on his ear but you cant keep a good horse down 
 Mounted police sprung to action Never cut me any bit of slack 
 But I wasnt going anywhere til they got off my brothers backAs through a glass darkly you seek yourself 
 But the light grows weak while under Yggsdrasil 
 A basket of eggs may you count your days 
 Though your gut lies filled only shells remain 
 I can tell youve been drinking by the scent of your breath 
 Another little sip a bit deeper in debt 
 You can rest your head in your wrinkled hands 
 But when you awake youre in another land 
 In fields of green rolling on endlessly 
 You find a fallen nest where there is no tree 
 Mark the brown furred hound tied to the mandrake root 
 Dare you carve a face in that virtue food 
 I can tell what youre thinking I see it everyday 
 Ill help you with your coat see you on your way 
 Sure you want to go walking on a night like this 
 Look there goes another one now one day I swear they will not miss 
 As through a glass darkly you seek yourself 
 Though your gut lies filled only shells remainThey came marchin down the street in robes 
 In the spirit of Spanish Inquisition 
 Guitars and trombones 
 Mechanical monkeys make good musicians 
 Streets urchins the smugglers and dingos 
 Dead languages and living man lingos 
 Put the relics of the saint in a glass box and march him around the block 
 Hangin on the words of a madman 
 Islands in the abyss 
 No use for the poet 
 When the hopeless seek no bliss 
 Mason jars of petroleum 
 You know those kids dont play 
 And should you ever get ahold of them 
 Ill tell you exactly what they say 
 Time we told you son about the family curse 
 And when they opened up the diary 
 To gain an explanation 
 They find only terminal verse 
 Xray visions 
 Eye in the sky 
 The naked being led by the blind 
 So Bottoms up Socrates

 Goes down easy

 Nothing left but smoke and cellar 
 And a woman with a black umbrella 
 Little Lewis lost his shit

 Fish Head Phil Itchy Ike 
 Say they never got home that night 
 Shake the breaker 
 That girl aint no money maker 
 Shes come to cook all the books 
 And flaunt her good looks 
 And a woman with a black umbrellaAfter defying the grip on the hangmans noose 
 And recovering my cognizance 
 Spun the compass north by northwest 
 And took liberty out for a long slow dance 
 Took a good look around what did I see 
 A big red tent and people coming in like the tide of the sea 
 I ducked in to catch some shade 
 Preacher jump up all ablaze 
 They say this year rock is coming back Jack 
 White gnashing teeth like wolves in the pack 
 Carnivorous no mercy son

 Before we speak of suicide we have all talked our bet 
 Dont you know the tapes will only get you so far 
 The devil may tip but my Jesus got an open bar 
 The devil may tip but my Jesus got an open barYou put me in the clutches of sin 
 Making me a burning specimen 
 Of worn animosity just to aspire 
 Leaving absolutely nothing behind 
 But now it seems that the tables have turned 
 Another dead end another lesson learned 
 One good turn deserves another 
 So here it is motherfucker 
 Youre just a semiautomatic hate machine 
 Semiautomatic hate machine 
 And Ive gone ballistic 
 Tooth and scratch 
 Give me an axe to grind 
 A practice made perfect matter over mind 
 Ive got the urge Ive got the urge 
 To clean up this place of your scourge 
 If cleanliness is next to Godliness 
 Then that would make you the devil 
 Call it what you will a preemptive strike 
 But the first law of nature is to defend ones life 
 Mine eyes have seen the glory 
 Grapes of wrath 
 And youre just a statisticRise now my son 
 You were suffering from a horrible dream 
 So mend your ways before they tear you by the seams 
 Youre not the first and not the last 
 So take this relic of the beloved past 
 Take it now Its yours pass it on preserve 
 This undeniable heritage of yours 
 So take this heirloom 
 So take the heirloom 
 But I dont want it 
 And I dont need it 
 So you can keep it 
 I dont want it I dont need it 
 Take your heirloom to hell 
 I will not fulfill your prophecy 
 Because this heirloom it burns like a scar 
 The call denies the branding iron at last

 Everything gonna be all right yeah yeah 
 Here we go 
 So then I smash up the palace like the son of Samson 
 Hollerin louder than all of Bedlam 
 Take me to higher ground 
 Then bury my body six feet down 
 And I walked 40 miles out into that desert now 
 Wailed and moaned 
 Til the lion he called my name yeah

 Out into outer space yeah yeah 
 And he said Everything gonna be all right 
 Everything gonna be all right oh yeah 
 Here we go here we go here we go 
 Oh yeah 
 I climbed the highest of the heights 
 Atop that mountain I watched the day turn into night 
 Oh I tell you I was a wretched sight 
 But I stood long and hard until the light 
 Rubbing needles in my eyes 
 Eating dirt 
 I stood up 
 And everything was all right 
 But then I smash on the palace like the son of Samson 
 Then bury my body six feet downHows that hardcore fanzine Still take the piss

 Off the shore of Laborador 
 The crew labored to bilge the hold 
 The stern it floundered in the shoal 
 The bow bucked up like a bronco 
 The crew was strong till Captain called 
 Throw the spermaceti oer 
 Throw the spermaceti overboard overboard 
 The captain woke with sandy eyes 
 Am I alone the old sir cried 
 Tis I he heard a bitter voice reply 
 Jason Kip of town 
 I fear the men have all been drowned 
 And we two are the only to survive to survive 
 Nancy was a pretty girl 
 Golden hair and eyes of pearl 
 And she made a pretty bride 
 For the ancient Captain Bly 
 Her true love was Jason Kip 
 Porter on the Captains ship 
 Nancy paced the widows walk 
 Listening to the widows talk 
 She heard Nancy do not weep 
 The ship is late but just a week 
 My late husband Captain Pierce 
 Was gone once for several years 
 He returned with silk and spice 
 Minus one leg and his eyes 
 In the end the ocean has its revenge 
 Whether tomorrow or 100 years 
 The Captain was a giant man 
 With miles of intestines 
 And a stomach larger than 
 The Persian Gulf 
 Was not 3 weeks when Bly took chase 
 And in his sleep untied him 
 And without a thought he ate him 
 Clean and whole clean and whole 
 As the Captain licked his lips 
 He was spotted by a ship 
 Nancy truly was relieved 
 But for Jason how she grieved 
 In a carriage they rode home 
 Any guilt he did not show 
 As they sat to dine that night 
 He lacked any appetite 
 As the two lay in their bed 
 Captains gut turned cherry red 
 With the sounds of galeforce wind 
 Sprung an angry Jason Kip 
 It takes limbs and lives 
 And from the wives an equal ocean of their fallen tearsWhats this about limits 
 Sorry I dont know none 
 Whats this about some DB limit 
 Sorry I cant hear none 
 You can take a little cruise down the river of booze 
 Act all poor and defeated 
 Shout to the mountain some boohoo blues 
 But Ill stand here and repeat it 
 Im an earth rocker 
 Everybody hear me now 
 Everybody get the message 
 If youre gonna do it do it live on stage 
 Or dont do it at all 
 If youre gonna do it you better take it to the stage 
 I will suffer no evil 
 My guitar will guide me through 
 I will suffer no evil 
 And this time I want to hear it from you 
 Break it down 
 To brass tacks 
 To just the facts 
 I dont need your sticky laminate 
 I dont need your VIP 
 I dont need your validation 
 Cause I wear mine on my sleeve 
 So dont look to me for answers 
 Cause I dont gotaone 
 I just came to have a good time 
 And Im gonna have one 
 Yes Ive lost many battles 
 And even more days 
 But if I had to do it over 
 Id do it just the same 
 Cause Im an earth rocker 
 Understand 
 Everybody get the messageNorman the Mormon hears the doorbell ring 
 But inside theyre not answering 
 Peering through the window to his surprise 
 The door flies open Come inside 
 I am Jason the Freemason what youre selling I do not need 
 Mr Patrick orthodox Catholic is more likely in your league 
 At that very moment Mr Softee rings his bells 
 Dingaling dingaling 
 Quickly thereafter ChocoTaco delight 
 While reclining on his brand new mountain bike 
 Now watch you most closely for here the plot does twist 
 Enter Simon the super Scientologist 
 Im opining sailing Simon Is you stupid or is you just high 
 Mother Hubbard got me covered like Sarah Lee on her cherry pie 
 Norman says to Simon Hey if there are really aliens 
 I would think that L Ron Hubbard would have to be one of them 
 Oh My Lord Oh My Lord Oh My Oh My 
 Harmonica solo 
 The Pie Man passes by on his way to the fair and he says 
 Reason wont you put your blue dress on 
 Reason wont you put your blue jeans on 
 At that very moment MrSoftee rings his bells 
 So before Simon could bring his crushing blow 
 Norman raises his hands Oh no oh no 
 Simon says Hey we aint even finished this 
 Norman says Yes we have Here come them Witnesses 
 Reason wont you put your blue dress onI dont know but Ive been told Im about twentyfour Earth years old 
 And come my next birthday itll be a quarter century 
 I dont know but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words 
 Take a look what the cat dragged in a red woodpecker and two of my kin 
 Back in 1980 we played the ADD 
 That game was harder than the Elfstones of Shanara 
 My character was baffling a druid wizard halfling 
 On top of that he was master of psionic powers 
 Bring on the hordes we have the sword 
 That smote the Goblin of Gygaxnor 
 Pray that the sisters name us as victors 
 Of the twenty sided die 
 I dont know but Ive been told Im about twentyfour Earth years old 
 Take a look what the cat dragged in a dead woodpecker and two of my kin 
 Long ago in Middle Earth 
 A man could measure all his worth 
 By his blade and by his staff 
 And by the runes on his epitaph 
 Go mount your horse and ride up north 
 To seek the Baron of the Frozen Berg 
 Ask for assistance in the resistance 
 Saw Mazes and Monsters Tom Hanks completely bonkers 
 He spoke what he doth speaketh in Elizabethan 
 Sad lad he really couldnt handle starting from scratch on the very first level 
 But he died the death of a warrior 
 A legend grows yearly by way of a local song 
 The bishop and castle move in defense of pawns 
 Im rolling Im tumbling a twenty sided die 
 A legend grows yearly by way of local song 
 Take a look what the cat dragged in a dead woodpecker and two of my kinOh I see that lantern 
 Trimmed low burning in our home 
 And though I feel like crying 
 I swear tonight Ill cry no more 
 And how many times have I prayed 
 That I would get lost along the way 
 Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head 
 The regulators swinging pendulum 
 Come with me and walk the longest mile 
 Is his wallet leather Is his wallet fat 
 For not a year later its got you lying on your back 
 You should have closed your windows and got another dog 
 You should have chained up all the doors and switched up all the locks 
 And how many times have I prayed 
 The angels would speed me away 
 Come with me and walk the longest mileCant funk with the feel 
 Or with the other three 
 This mother load 
 Comin atcha all 3Ds 
 We got big news 
 The party boat is here 
 The band is kicking 
 And I see lots of beers 
 And I believe there is gambling 
 On the deck just below from here 
 We got Greedo 
 Solo to the rear 
 They know the deal 
 Sacks packed and stacked with 
 Pieces of eight 
 A sailors life for me 
 Live free or die 
 Never look a bounty hunter in the eye 
 Damn 
 Now where were we 
 I think aces high 
 Sleeves are rolled 
 Tremendous diamonds 
 And a mouth of gold 
 I spent many years a rambling 
 Ill never change these foolish ways 
 Cause fortune tellers make a killing nowadays 
 Best keep living like a castaway 
 With my sack packed 
 Never look a merman in the eye 
 DamnIf it would disappear 
 If it would disappear 
 That 
 Which 
 Does 
 Not 
 Kill 
 You 
 Makes 
 Stronger 
 Take a big bite of my sweet addiction 
 Get a little closer to this sick affliction 
 Truth and consequences led to this conviction 
 Trial by error another crucifixion 
 Eat it up 
 Wash it down 
 Hit the deck 
 Kiss the ground 
 The enemy is within 
 And she is your only friend 
 If it would disappearAll you lasses in varnasses swallowing swords 
 Shooting out fire at us heathen hordes 
 I was thinking something before I began 
 But then you done cut off both of my hands 
 Now I do my drinking through bamboo straws 
 Constantly kicking at tarantulas 
 What was I thinking move to baltimore 
 O yeah the great outdoors 
 Jump into the water 
 Keelhauled on the constallations 
 Dont sell my belongings 
 Cause you know that Ill be back 
 Remember when I told you that I was a samurai 
 Well the fact of the matter is that was a lie 
 There were some other things that Id rather not recall 
 Yall can blame it all ont he alcohol 
 But you aint got no business criticizing me 
 This is my house and Ill do as I please 
 Move it on over and give me a slice 
 If youre int he market for a green zucchini 
 Farmers almanac got the largest size 
 Winnebago woman what ya cooking 
 Id be a richer man today if it werent for physics 
 If I could levitate I would sell lots of tickets 
 And maybe do an interview with Larry King while floating 
 Move it on over and give me a sliceWell all right 
 There are women in Cypress Grove 
 And if they catch you you dont go home 
 So get to booking and dont look back 
 A one way ticket on a two way track 
 Two way track 
 Now tell me 
 Holy Diver where you at 
 Theres a woman on the hill in a wide brimmed hat 
 With a shotgun 44 
 And a big blood hound in the back of a jacked up Ford 
 They say the water is cherry wine 
 And all them women drunk all the time 
 Sheriff Jackson went out the back 
 And now his daughters all dress in black 
 Dress in black 
 And a razor back boar in the back of a jacked up Ford 
 You better keep on running Bukka 
 Theyre playing you for succotash and your stash is gone 
 And a black plastic bag in the back of a jacked up FordIt wasnt gambling that caused me to kill my friend Peter Blue 
 It wasnt gambling that caused me to kill my friend Peter Blue 
 If you caught your best friend with your wife 
 Youd do the same thing too 
 When they strapped on the lie detector 
 The needle kept going up and down 
 And they knew I were lyin 
 Since I first sat down 
 So I spoke to my conscious and asked what should I do 
 Yes I spoke to my conscious and asked what should I do 
 My conscious said Shorty 
 I would plead guilty if I were you 
 So I stood up on my feet and raised up my right hand 
 I said Judge Im confessing 
 I shot my womans man 
 So the prosecutor asked me 
 Shorty why did you kill that man 
 I said If youve never been in love 
 Then you wouldnt understand 
 When I signed my confession this is what I wrote 
 That Im throwing myself 
 On the mercy of the court 
 When the jury found me guilty 
 My womans eyes were full of tears 
 The verdict was manslaughter 
 I got from one to twenty years 
 Baby one year aint no sentence and twenty years aint no time 
 And if I pass 
 Ill see you when I do my timeMi corona es la montaña

 Obviously theyve been gentrified 
 Gentrified and I got no time for that 
 The wolfman is coming outRats over the dishes 
 Rats over the dishes 
 Please tell me what the ratties say

 To expose this human weakness 
 And to think that this was once my home 
 But now some sick bastards pleasure dome 
 They say to build a better man trap 
 The rats Will lead a path to your door 
 Build a better man trap 
 And the rats will beat a path to your door

 But her mother and her father sure dont want me there 
 I gotta study some scheme Lord get my baby back to herself 
 Lord I love that woman and I dont want nobody else 
 I looked down that road just as far as I could see 
 There was a bunch of women and they be following me 
 The brook run into the ocean the ocean run into that deep blue sea 
 The brook run into the ocean the river run into that deep deep deep blue sea 
 You ought to have seen them women Lord they be fishing after meDown wind from Pigtown wrecks in the yard 
 Scream at the sun Just finish the job 
 Telephone poles slowly weep in their pitch 
 The butchers brown sweat runs back down the ditch 
 A great place to visit a better place to leave 
 False poison sumac lies on the eave 
 Weather vanes speed up over the motoring of shutters 
 The Pigtown blues run deep down the gutters 
 The skies are heavy hey bro 
 Block after block after block 
 Out across the marsh trees harshly accuse 
 Pointing black fingers most broke with abuse 
 Hightension wires lurch in degrees 
 Men have their conscience while dogs have their fleas 
 Cyclops winks as he sinks to the soil 
 Labor in vain labor and toil 
 The residents succumb to the shadows and sticks 
 The Pigtown blues run right through the bricks 
 Block after block after blockI walk wherever the weather provides 
 Cause everybody needs some time outside 
 Gimme no lip and Ill tell you no lie

 But I make due with what I have 
 Pure rock fury the solution is so clear 
 Calling all humans and able volunteers 
 I walk wherever the weather provides cause everybody needs some time outside 
 I seen them boxes in peliculas one time stands out in particular 
 I seen you dance in the arena all in makeup dressed up like a ballerina 
 I got to wonder whats got into you or just what you got into 
 I walk wherever the weather provides 
 Hotter than abba in nevada sun in a real small car with the windows rolled up 
 No super trooper cause you pooped your pants and youre screaming o please 
 Just give me one more chance 
 Not one to shrink from helping humankind brother 
 But one other thing that you might keep in mind 
 Calling all humans and able volunteersHold the presses Mikey Hot news on the wire 
 Hundreds see an image of a Guinness drinking choir 
 Celebrities and cameras are headed to the scene 
 While presidents are fleeing to their speeding limousines 
 Dont worry its just stigmata 
 Pass me a napkin and dont you dare tell my mother 
 Your local programming interrupted 
 By the mindless banter of a soulless talking head 
 Roll out the red carpet dripping bloody tongue 
 Pay no mind to blue berets and all their shiny guns 
 Who you gonna call when the man brings his hammer down 
 Goose stepping with a smoking Irish fly 
 And when our world is over children by the fire 
 Raise their hands and pray that they may see a new Messiah 
 And somewhere in the darkness a flag goes running by 
 The smell of cigarettes and love are incense for the fly 
 Goose stepping with a smoking Irish flyBorn with a moustache and a supernova 
 Tossed off the cliffs of Dover 
 Washed up on a far away shore 
 In the arms of the daughter of the Buffalo

 Reverend said he was the other one

 Atop the mountain under cities 
 We are monsters we are older than men 
 Yes we are Gorgons and we will have our revenge 
 Frighten their children by speaking our name 
 Epoch and eon its always the same 
 We are monsters but we will no longer run 
 We are the Cyclops and our time has come 
 This world was ours before it had ever known men 
 Soon it will be ours again 
 Grant them their tales of their forefathers glory 
 For soon it will be ours again 
 Atop the buttress the gargoyle sits 
 The fragile foundation crumbles to bits 
 We are monsters and they are but men 
 Behold the Colossus rises again 
 And soon it will be ours again 
 Soon it will be ours againLike a fly to doo doo

 Upon my release I had my suspicions 
 That they were too liberal and skillful with all the incisions 
 Cool heads prevailed and now its all too clear to me

 Did you know the answers or did you guess 
 You rely on gimmicks to amuse your fans 
 And act all over bad to jack up your sound scan 
 Whats the matter with you 
 How come you rhyme monosyllabically 
 Has atrophy stricken your entire vocabulary 
 Your styles like a garbage can 
 Its meant to be taken out on a weekly basis 
 Ever since you first reckoned you been in a state of suspended animation 
 You invoke Snuffleupagus and australopithecus

 Leave you confused but completely unharmed 
 Do you really think its true 
 Theyll Listen but they cant hear you 
 Now look here 
 Both you and I know the past ten years have been rather intense 
 And Im ashamed to admit that I have been fooled by the seductions of violence 
 People walking around with ugly auras 
 Sometimes Im even tempted to see the advice of Dr Laura 
 But I ignore her 
 And I take a deep breath and count to ten 
 Aint gonna let it get under my skin 
 Take a deep breath and count to ten 
 Think of all the nice places that Ive been 
 Like back when I was waging peace against the Visigoths 
 I was tutored in the ancient mystories by a wizened philosoph 
 Learned the polyrhythm of celestial time 
 And wait for the one to come and get it done and finish the rhyme

 To hide from the dawn 
 The RockOlas fire 
 Burns on and on 
 Have no fear the dark of night 
 She walks before us Our Lady of Electric Light 
 She enters the bar room 
 And lifts her veil 
 With a voice like running water 
 She tells them her tale 
 The patrons all break down at the sight 
 Standing in the presence of Our Lady of Electric Light 
 Tiny plastic sabers 
 Piled high to my knees 
 Though the war rages on 
 I still find no enemies 
 They draw back the curtain 
 Are blinded by the dawn 
 And the shining RockOla 
 Spins on and on 
 Now I know I can no longer fight 
 And I run into the arms of Our Lady of Electric Light

 And every time you open up your mouth 
 A loud of horseshit comes flying right back out 
 Flying right back out 
 Mr Freedom big time talker oh but thank you very much but no 
 Serious business on your lapel 
 Let the people know how you feel 
 And every bumper sticker on the back of your car 
 Makes you feel a little more real 
 A little more real 
 Mr Freedom big time talker oh but thank you but no 
 I bet you would like nothing better 
 Than for the shit to hit the fan 
 And from the safety of your arm chair 
 Probably there just glad that no one else but you can possibly understand 
 Thanks for thinking of me

 While on a sea of air 
 Everyone I hear is saying 
 Captain Beyond will be there 
 When we go carelessly careening quickly 
 Screaming all the way 
 Gravity is such a drag 
 And we will not obey 
 Carelessly careening quickly 
 Now we will have our way 
 Wasnt I Or was it shadow 
 A trick of light in play 
 Leaving me to see that I saw 
 The garden from whence we came 
 But Im not saying anything 
 That hasnt been said before 
 You may hear it now if you wish to 
 Put an ear against the floor 
 Then we go carelessly careening quickly 
 Now we will have it 
 On the hills of charming dragons 
 There is snow falling everywhere 
 Sorcerers bring a new Sun 
 And we will soon be there 
 Now we will have itStruck down by a vision of beauty 
 Said I was struck down by a long legged archer 
 Oh the city was hot but my blood ran cold 
 Oh the city went dark keep calm and carry on 
 I was a young man only 19 years old 
 Said I was a young man so very far away from home 
 Ah she got me struck down 
 Right through the heart struck down 
 Ah she shot me struck down 
 Keep calm and carry on 
 Reefer madness quiets the falling bomb 
 I want to be an old man damn you von Braun 
 Ive been laid low by a blinding light 
 Ive been torn asunder by the banshees wail 
 I was a very young man so far away from home 
 I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty 
 I was struck down by the long legged archer 
 Reefer madness quiets the falling bombIn a city of crooked alleys 
 Crookeder women and wicked men 
 Dim lamps in the rumor mill 
 Suspicious kith and unkind kin 
 Haruspectre General 
 Sleeping soldiers in the field 
 Below the elders conspire 
 To turn the merciless and massive wheel 
 Strange cousins from the west 
 Overstay their welcome 
 Locked in among skeletons 
 Broken hearted and damned 
 Sorry to have to break it to you friend 
 But life seldom goes exactly as we plan 
 Peculiar manner and strange dress 
 Who will ever dare to tell them 
 The citys always thriving 
 Hungry bellows of the Minotaur 
 Everyday more are arriving 
 And everyday it requires more 
 Unexpected circumstance 
 We must not delay 
 You have all been so very very kind to us 
 And we will return the favor one day 
 Fate is the idiots excuse 
 Freedom is the suckers dream 
 But we hope you find some measure of comfort 
 In considering us to be your family 
 Savage bellows of the Minotaur 
 And everyday it requires moreEvery day I wake up 
 We drink a lot of coffee and watch the CNN 
 Every day I wake up 
 To a bowl of clover honey and let the locusts fly in 
 Lobsterbacks attack the town again 
 Wrap all my things in aluminum 
 Beams of darkness streak across the sky 
 Pink rays from the ancient satellite 
 Every time I look out my window 
 Same three dogs looking back at me 
 Every time I open my windows 
 Cranes fly in to terrorize me

 Bugger bugger bugger dumb the last of academe

 Shaven like a banker lilac vegetal 
 Break the glass ceiling and the golden parachute on down

 Open to Floors

 But honestly speaking now 
 We all got the same disease 
 Im afraid the partys canceled 
 The servants never showed 
 All the world was penciled 
 On this foreboding note 
 Force gettin ready 
 Man begat too much 
 All the world will suffer 
 The Wookies wicked clutch 
 The Theocrats 
 With cricket bats

 Love to give ya 
 Never take it back 
 A graver danger 
 You bouncing ravers 
 Medulla oblongata go 
 Ill see you all later 
 Hephaestus draggin 
 One leg behind 
 And when the trap is sprung 
 The warrior loses his mind 
 Assassins trippin 
 High on hashish 
 But honestly speaking now 
 We all need the same relief 
 One day or another kid 
 Our world will be gone 
 Our death will be done

 Threefold or more 
 Now you cant get off of that killing floor 
 Im going back to Tennessee 
 Back where I come from 
 Gonna head back to Beale Street 
 Beale Street and Oblivion Oblivion 
 The devil  me bad blood and beef 
 An undisciplined child a liar and a thief 
 Its a low down shame we were the best of friends 
 But I suppose all good things got to come to an end 
 Beale Street and Oblivion 
 Gotta get off of that killing floor 
 Get off of that killing floor 
 Gotta get offYes Ill be a responsible member 
 Of this great and blessed society 
 Ive come to understand the wrongful nature 
 Of gun ownership in the age of monarchy 
 But sometimes its just so hard 
 To act like the person you were born to be 
 Felonious behavior 
 Countless misdemeanors 
 Impersonating an officer of the law 
 Oh no 
 Bonafide man of action 
 How you like that 
 You cant stop you cant stop progress 
 You cant stop you cant stop no no no 
 I understand theres no victimless crimes 
 That being said I feel rather victimized 
 And I will seek substantial compensation 
 Whether legally legalish or otherwise 
 But sometimes its such a hassle 
 To sit patiently outside the open gates of a loaded castle 
 You cant stop you cant stop no no noMy nasty Yankee mannerisms 
 Didnt jive with the local traditions 
 How was I to know she had a jealous husband 
 He was the GM of a Tractor Supply 
 Well acquainted with the guns and knives 
 Sometimes I swear I have less sense than a bag of hammers 
 I prayed for courage I prayed for love 
 I prayed for guidance from the heavens above 
 I prayed to know divine protections 
 But now Im praying for a quick death in Texas 
 Heehhey 
 Please forgive me Mr Gibbons 
 I crawled my way into The Doom Saloon 
 In an attempt to cauterize my wounds 
 I did a terrible job and they became powerfully infected 
 I found myself atop a stolen roan 
 Quite convinced that I would never see home 
 And all on account of my lack of common manners 
 The saloon doors stopped swinging 
 The piano player stopped playing 
 In the shadows I could hear Archaic Spanish phrases 
 The preacher stood up from his table 
 In his right hand he held a bible 
 And in his left the business end Of a Winchester rifle 
 Beaumont Amarillo got a line on me

 Galveston El Paso Nacogdoches AbileneCaptain America where are you now 
 Minuteman please show me how 
 To wash this blood from my hands make it go away

 Sins of gods run through the head a second genesis 
 Some have called it ignorance others have called it bliss

 Heehaw Heehaw Heehaw HeehawNo horizon is obscured by the clouds 
 Settlements make nary a sound 
 And there were black birds singing and fish floating on the sea 
 While the bells of the buoys all rang in harmony 
 Bury your treasure burn your crops 
 Black water rising and it aint gonna stop 
 The governor he been long gone 
 Anchor dropped on his front lawn 
 Build a keep and dig a moat 
 The return of the Swollen Goat 
 Can you hear the fife and drums 
 Barnacles barking at the sun 
 Aint no chance so dont you try 
 Now everybody got to die 
 We do not desire tributes 
 We desire information 
 We seek the worm drink 
 Who has lately betrayed his nation 
 Albatross on your neck 
 And a hooker on the shore 
 Dogmen to the deck

 And would you not consider it unnatural to be born outside the womb

 La curandera is the young girl 
 In a linen dress in a linen dress of white 
 She dances on black sand in the night 
 Let us vote to dunk the witch in the river Styx and photograph the lye 
 So in the shadow of Cerberus her spirit will reside 
 Bird in the fire mouthful of sand

 That while in the Yakima 
 Digging up them thunderegg stones 
 Well we cracked them wide open 
 The mountain started smoking 
 And the sky turned the color of a crow 
 Ooh ooh 
 Fires in the northlands 
 Floods to the south 
 Put the pedal to the metal 
 And let it all hang out 
 Gogo gogo 
 The ash turned to confetti 
 Alleluia 
 Outside them great tricities 
 Oh God showed his great mercy 
 Turned ash into confetti 
 Handkerchiefs on coughing mouths 
 Running to the full hotels 
 Left us with no other place but home 
 And in the distance 
 Tail lights came and went 
 Sometimes as eyes of Vulcan sorcery 
 Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe well make it to that rise 
 Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe well see another sun rise OH Yeah 
 AlleluiaOld John Brown left Kansas before the blood had dried 
 And as he rode his head did shine like the sun in midJuly 
 In a tiny farm house by Brunswick piano 
 He warmed his boots by the fireplace and read aloud from Samuel 
 David rose to beat the Philistines with five smooth stones and a sling 
 One October morning his army did approach 
 The armory that sat between the Potomac and Shenandoah 
 The engine house flung open with report of several guns 
 When it was done he looked upon the bodies of his dying sons 
 David rose to beat the Philistines with five smooth stones and a sling 
 Throughout our history there are those ghosts 
 Compelled to illustrate our dreams and hopes 
 Victors hang in pictures losers from ropes 
 Regardless they all swing in the same boat 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 In Southampton County round 1831 
 Nat Turner prayed and the cornstalks swayed 
 A voice rose up and a text was raised 
 In the planters steak house they went from room to room 
 When it was done they rode along to liberate Jerusalem 
 Regardless they all swing in the same boatMy baby caught the train left me all alone 
 My baby caught the train left me all alone 
 She know I love her she done me wrong

 If bad you can toss em back and stuff them in sausages 
 Isnt it something so becoming a gentlemen of good taste 
 The appetizers quite the pleaser but might you pass the pepper please this way 
 Fertilizer makes your corn row higher but makes your back yard stink 
 And all the crows know where the wind blows where water sinks 
 Hey hey hey hey

 I smiled at one person then I nodded to three more 
 One man asked me for a dollar I asked him what its for

 Oh he looked to be about as strong as a fish 
 And I tell it as I wonder whats the poor mans only dying wish 
 The winter of ought five 
 Left with two score and five lives 
 For the red eyed coal dogs howl 
 Could be heard for miles around 
 In the book of Genesis 
 God grants man dominion 
 Over animals and the black dogs 
 Of P Pont caught a glimpse 
 Come springtime there was food 
 But the widows all refused 
 And the poor mans black dogs came 
 To escort those who remained 
 Brothers Sisters 
 Go across the river 
 Dont look back once there 
 Trust in God and take care 
 The winter of our fall 
 Could be heard for miles aroundWell I crashed a Cadillac through the Gates Of Hell 
 And returned with a Fist Full Of Dollars

 And you know I hang like a hex on a barn 
 Grind the guardrail like a nail on a file 
 Above and beyond the hole nine yards 
 Well I rolled Jesse Helms like a cigarette 
 And smoked him higher than the highest of the minarets

 Started learning to come to where the flavor is 
 Flavor is 
 You started learning to come to Where the Flavor Is 
 The skies are always sunny in the heart of Flavor Country 
 Where the washers stuffed with money are growing like grass 
 Junk bondage racks never cut you slack 
 But thats the way the racket goes when rounding up green backs 
 Dont hate me just because Im beautiful

 When youre raised with The Good The Bad The Ugly 
 A holy trinity in Flavor Country

 There is a velvet room for the discriminating pack 
 Celebrities and tentacles regard the beast with two backs 
 Paparazzi world wide video debut 
 And just when you thought it could get no stranger 
 May I present the semblance of a Scandinavian doppelganger 
 From the frozen depths of a forgotten fjord 
 The never sleeping for want of eating unholy stench of the manticoreWent out the back of Halifax 
 All the way to Virginia Fairfax 
 It wasnt weird enough 
 So I went west to Oregon 
 All I All I wonder 
 While I run 
 Is whats is whats 
 Next on my agenda 
 I made a ruckus with a succubus 
 Before she knew I was amphibious 
 She threw her hands up and started to scream 
 Man you look like your straight outta V 
 All I all I wonder 
 spoken 
 And so it was that I a wayward throwback to the Mesozoic was enslaved as a circus freak to entertain you drunken monkeys But Fate still had her twisted sense of humor and she granted me safe passage to sunny Florida where for over the past 300 years now I have been breeding with an unheard of efficiency And soon my progeny will rise up and say Hail Draco king of the dragon men 
 I fashion my crown from Quetzlcoatls quills 
 Build my palace in the jungles of Brazil 
 In the summertime come my children 
 For I hail Draco king of dragon men

 If you knew half the things I see 
 Please please just do as I say 
 Repent and leave your evil ways 
 Meanwhile planes drop from the sky 
 People disappear and bullets fly 
 Little grey men are coming our way 
 Tastes just like chicken they say 
 Actually theyre all around 
 Secret bunkers underground 
 Round em up skin em alive 
 Rolling rolling rolling rawhide 
 Carter is a clone 
 Dozen brothers round the globe 
 MJ12 damned us to hell 
 Scroll and Key Skull and Bone 
 Its only just begun 
 The best is yet to come 
 Area 51 
 The spawn of Babylon 
 Couldnt give a damn about JFK 
 Everythings conspiracy 
 Wouldnt be surprised if they have their way 
 I know its hard to swallow 
 It must sound too far fetched 
 But you can bet your bottom dollar 
 I aint going with the restEvery time I set to write 
 Lyricals on the women 
 I always seem to end up 
 The victim of some terrible ass kicking 
 So now Im telling myself 
 Friend why you got the obsession 
 Here it is now people 
 To the best of my recollection 
 It goes against my Catholic upbringing 
 I admit it Im a sucker for The Witch 
 Sucker for The Witch 
 I can tell you precisely 
 Where this all began 
 Salem Massachusetts 
 And I was hardly a man 
 I fell madly in love with 
 Some brand of Stevie Nicks 
 Oh I begged and I pleaded 
 Like a fiend for a fix 
 I must unburden my guilty conscience 
 May God have mercy on my wicked soul 
 I cant help myself Im a sucker for The Witch 
 I might deny her but my heart will never resist 
 I cant help myself Im a sucker 
 Shes made her appearances 
 In many the rhyme 
 And thats my cross to bear 
 Until the end of time 
 Better call The Inquisition 
 Better put me to the test 
 Give me exorcism 
 For I am truly possessed 
 For The Witch 
 I cant help myself Im a suckerWake up 
 IncomingScientific progress 
 All too real 
 Dialectic nonsense 
 All unreal

 Down into flames 
 Scientific progress 
 A circle revealed 
 Perfect as always 
 As all ways are real 
 Begin phase one againWhat kind of ugly are they talking about 
 Its just straight up cold evil 
 What kind of nonsense are they going on about 
 Do they suffer from the fever 
 Nothings gonna satisfy them 
 Till it all goes Chernobyl 
 No nothings ever really gonna satisfy them 
 Until the virus goes mobile 
 If you didnt then well now you know

 Took a lunatic for a ride 
 And a little voice said inside my head 
 Rosemary baby I got the thyme oh 
 Suffering madness and the pharoahs plague 
 I Akhenaten tell you some other day 
 No thank you thats enough for me 
 A little bit of Ritalin goes a long way 
 Ready to rock if you want to roll 
 Please step away from the vehicle 
 Ragnarök and revolutionize 
 Gimme just a minute while I clarify 
 Cooled down my temper tried to remember 
 What it was I wasnt to lose 
 And I probably could were it not for 
 The beer and the broads and the broads and the booze 
 Yeah 
 Hooked on stupid and the whole shebang 
 I never have ever felt the same 
 Thats prozacly not what I need 
 Gimme just a minute while I clarifyI send pictures through the mail 
 Well documented and very detailed 
 To politicians and big celebrities 
 But none of them are believing in me 
 And I await their response 
 Some send none most send cops 
 But man its a dire situation 
 And I will risk the public humiliation 
 Sleestak lightning on my trail 
 Its a dire situation they are on my trail 
 West Virginia has its Moth Man 
 Pan handlers got their Skunk Ape 
 But I have a tazer and night vision goggles 
 Costco rolls of black duct tape 
 Its got red eyes its got razor claws 
 Its got green skin no it aint a methhead 
 And after studying its behavior objectively and critically 
 I believe I have a reliable methodAbove there is no ending 
 For the vodkaspinning Mir 
 All that is is passing 
 And now is never here 
 So keep on raging 
 You frenzied pioneers 
 No time for the wringing of hands 
 Strange faced ambassadors strike up the band 
 Bust out that Dom Pérignon 
 Johnnie Walker Red on that fairway lawn 
 Remember tripping on the fourth of July 
 Exploding octopuses in disguise 
 They picked you up and then they never let you down 
 Everyones forgiven in the land of Pleasant Living now 
 Yuri Gagarin 
 Sends his kindest regards 
 How those Yankees doing 
 Still rock and roll and fancy cars 
 But on to pressing matters 
 Such as the gluttony of the starving stars 
 Everyones forgiven in the land of Pleasant Living nowThey arrive on a sunny day 
 Offering the residents a better way 
 Before you know it youre in line 
 And chanting refrain 
 They reel you in and then they drown you out 
 First they tell ya 
 Youre gonna lose your soul 
 And then they tell ya 
 Find another home 
 And then you take a good look around 
 And they stole your rock and roll 
 And once its gone youll never get it back 
 One thousand Les Pauls 
 Burning in a field 
 What rabid religion 
 Poisons their minds 
 One thousand Jazzmasters 
 Thrown into the sea 
 What measure of madness 
 Governs their time Alright 
 In the beginning 
 There was void 
 The hand woke up 
 Then there was noise 
 Fire and water 
 Heaven and stone 
 Radio kings 
 Hammer and throne 
 Smoulder in a field 
 Fastens their hearts 
 Sunk down to the bottom of the sea 
 Drives them apart 
 The face woke up 
 Uncounted Les Pauls 
 Are sainted to the sky 
 Where there was darkness 
 Now only light 
 Uncounted Jazzmasters 
 Rising up from the bottom of the sea 
 The wicked are nought 
 The righteous are free 
 Explode and take flight 
 Are rocking from the bottom of the sea 
 The righteous are freeWent to the five and dime 
 Bought myself a copy of Time 
 And on the cover was a woman that I knew 
 When I was excavating in the mountains of Peru 
 I caught a plane to LIA 
 I didnt know what I would say 
 Maybe she would like me I had lost a lot of weight 
 Since she had last seen me in 1988 
 Went to a local bar and ordered a cerveza 
 Asked a man about the woman on the cover 
 Dijo Claro que si es el presidentes daughter 
 Asked him where she might me 
 You did not hear this from me 
 The girl is a terrorista 
 En las montanas a Chuquibambilla 
 Took a bus through mountains 
 Oh my head was pounding 
 Got to stay strong and carry on 
 Got to stay strong it wont be long 
 Arrived in the villa surrounded by guerrillas 
 Then my girl took me in her arms 
 She said How have you been 
 Oh but Ill see you again 
 I woke up in a coffin underneath 
 An altar to the east of Machu Pichu 
 Crawled from the royal tomb 
 The sun was bright it burned my eyes 
 I knew that she was gone 
 So I went down to the riverside 
 And I cried 
 I went down to the riverside 
 I went down and I cried 
 Muchas veces I dont know if Im coming or Im going 
 Muchas veces Im at a loss as what to do 
 Muches veces Im at a loss as what to do 
 My friend said Shes nothing but pain 
 I said I still love her the same 
 All she needs is a little bit of love and 
 Im sure I can make her change some 
 What about that girl in Zaire 
 That you met while a volunteer 
 She got quite the education and 
 Quite the pair of legs on her 
 Oh she married an Englishman 
 A correspondent for CNN 
 She thought he was rather handsome 
 In a UN blue flak jacket 
 Oh I see where your coming from 
 But for me there is no other one 
 I must be on my merry way 
 Went to the five and dime 
 Claiming she was a kahuna down on Oahu 
 Caught a plane to HIA 
 I knew that she was near because I felt 
 Shivers on my spine 
 I felt fineSick though it may seem It has always been a dream 
 Of mine to watch you drop 
 Like one million freezing flies 
 Psychopathic my mathematic 
 Always sums to zero 
 Population your equation always equal hero 
 Burn burn 
 So the fruits of your labours 
 Have fermented into wine 
 And the sweat that you dripped 
 Is now the honey of the hive 
 The city is a burning sun 
 And I a blooming flower 
 The fire the flame 
 The passion the power 
 And you your kindling innocent 
 The fruits of your labours 
 The passion the powerPanamoebic algebra breed bizarre bacteria what to do oh what to do 
 Africanized killer bees alabastar deities milk from spoons sip milk from spoons 
 Within the ruins against the firth 
 The salamander has given birth 
 Only red horse rainbows can save us 
 Let them run wild and asunder 
 Call the royal guard to let the people in 
 Flaming arrows by hundreds 
 Pull the bog man from the peat stand him up on both his feet 
 He jigs and reels he jigs and reels 
 Infiltrating silver crabs carry a most scented flag to their front lines to their front lines 
 Within the ruins 
 Against the firth 
 And now the salamander 
 Run to the tower and call up the magus 
 If he has caused this well tear out his pages 
 Throw Im in shackles 
 And remove his handsBehold the man a living example 
 In his likeness sacred profane 
 Behold the man what I have done 
 The path to hell is paved 
 With least resistance 
 But those less traveled by 
 Shall make a world of difference 
 Beating myself to a pulp 
 Extracting from my skull 
 All those things Ive learned to live with 
 All those things Ive loved 
 All these things are killing me 
 A perpetual fall from grace 
 But the hand that feeds 
 Is the hand that beats me 
 Fiercely in the face 
 So I will build myself an effigy 
 No longer mope in mediocre hell 
 Behold the man a living example 
 Behold the man what have I done 
 Behold the man in his likeness 
 Sacred profane 
 What have I done 
 Effigy 
 Behold the man 
 The icons betrayal and guilt 
 The icons betrayal and filth 
 The icon what have I doneIf I cant win 
 Then I will multiply 
 You cannot oppose 
 What you cant recognize 
 Drop down drop down 
 All the angels sing 
 Drop down to all fours 
 Like an ape like a child like dog like a king 
 Like a king 
 Im a walking definition 
 Of a defense mechanism 
 I have no wants I only know needs 
 And what I need now is a new anatomy 
 And they are like the insect 
 So simple yet so hard to appease 
 And they are like the virus 
 And I am your equal 
 And opposite reaction 
 So feel this second skin 
 And they are like the insect 
 So feel this second skin 
 Like an ape like a child like a king like a dog 
 Like a child like an ape like a king 
 If I cant win 
 And you you should be smiling 
 This is evolutions finest hour 
 One step back would be on the forward 
 And into the wayward out 
 And into the wayward outWell you made me weep and you made me moan 
 When you caused me to leave child my happy home 
 But someday baby you aint worry my life anymore 
 I get satisfaction everywhere I go 
 Where I lay my head thats where I call home 
 Whether barren pines or the mission stare 
 Take tomorrows collar and give em back the glare 
 Bang bang bang bang 
 Vámonos vámonos 
 Bang bang bang 
 You told everybody in the neighborhood 
 What a dirty mistreater that I was no good 
 But someday baby you aint aworry my life anymore 
 Doctor or lawyer Ill never be 
 Life of a drifter the only life for me 
 You can have your riches all the gold you saved 
 Cause aint room for one thing in everybodys grave 
 If I had money like Henry Ford 
 Lord Id have me a woman yeah on every road 
 Invocation of the dummies requiem for a head 
 Cash in at the corner piles of street cred 
 One day baby youll worry me no more 
 Vámonos vámonos yeahFine swine wish you were mine 
 Bite the apple of my eye 
 This little piggy never made it home 
 Helter skelter run for shelter 
 Cant escape the boiling swelter 
 Beat you like the dog that you are 
 Oh I could kill you if I wanted 
 Kill you with my own two hands 
 Oh Im so happy I could kill you 
 Kill you like a sacrificial lamb 
 Because you you are nothing but an animal 
 With a branding iron on your back 
 A sight so obscene a sight so absurd 
 So many ways to skin a cat 
 All cut up 
 Everything tastes better now 
 My hands these tools the fatted cow 
 The swine the wine the coming feast 
 Your Jesus Christ has canine teeth 
 Fine swine wish you were mine 
 Your Jesus Christ has canine teethI met a lady down in Prathertown two rocking chairs 
 She said take a seat boy and Ill treat you fair 
 Snake charmers cold infidels get a running start 
 Pick up the pieces in the graveyard and unbury my heart 
 The wolf howls at midnight the rooster at the dawn 
 Opossum minister where you been so long 
 Montgomery Village kids you just look like the type 
 You sure you want to know the mysteries Youre but a trifling height 
 Families in their den staring at the box 
 Opossum minister hen done killed the fox 
 Eyes like clouds know you stare 
 Count the minutes by the rocking of chairs 
 Prathertown unincorporated 
 May you stay far unrelated 
 To the wicked ways of Montgomery Village 
 Theres a darkness deep in their eyes 
 As if the sun dont rise 
 Those poor afflicted people of Montgomery Village 
 Fake farmers straight jezebels you know the score 
 Pick up the pieces in the graveyard and leave em at the door 
 The masterplan unfolds silent sinister 
 Is there any hope left Opossum Minister 
 Those poor afflicted people of Montgomery VillageRatted out in hades 
 Forced to return 
 To Rockville 
 With nothing but a rucksack 
 Hard lesson learned 
 Foul council of leeches 
 Want silence and bet em 
 Take rebute 
 And a dagger to the bites 
 Then suck out the venom 
 Oh Isabella 
 Your ships run aground 
 Kneel at the sword 
 Scream at the clouds 
 Theres smoke on the wind 
 Jaguar in fever 
 Have taken your men 
 Running on the tightrope 
 Woven by spider 
 While the canyon 
 Teeming with shoppers 
 Grows wider and wider 
 What demons possessing 
 The clock and the compass 
 Surrender 
 Run headlong to the void 
 The reptiles among us 
 Chained to the ox cart 
 With a chest full of arrows 
 The villages 
 Are burning with cedar 
 By bag and by barrow 
 Scrub brush from the wasteland 
 Snake in a tree 
 Remember 
 When they throw the torches in 
 Breathe breathe breathe 
 Have taken your menLike Marlon Brando but bigger 
 Youll find that creature at the bottom of the deep down Susquehanna River 
 This one I had it stood right on up to me 
 Tore out his hook and declared himself a prodigy 
 But oh no fishing aint what it used to be 
 Ive seen some bad years but this one is just killing me 
 One little nibble in thirteen years 
 I really pack em in 
 This one I had I seen it in dreams 
 All shacked up with lightning and horizon beams 
 Well I bring em on up and then I pack em on in 
 In all the places Ive been 
 And I swear its never been like this before 
 Least not since 19 and 44 
 But today I made a sick discovery 
 Lead box in Sassafras Cove 
 Well I brought him on up and then I packed him on in 
 Oh yes Im really cashing in 
 Wash of the Chesapeake and Appalachian Blue Range 
 I have discovered the body of John Wilkes Booth 
 Yes its true I have Mr Booth 
 Everybody got to make a living somehow 
 Do I hear a million 
 And then I bring em on up and then I pack em on in 
 And then I pack em on in 
 And then I pack em on inI been working one eye dollar 
 Bye and bye Lord bye and bye 
 I been working one eye dollar 
 I got the plans to the Oval Office 
 I got the plans in my front pocket 
 In the inner chambers of the President 
 You will find no crosses only pentagrams 
 Beelzebub and business suits on the hot line all right 
 And to think that some of it ends up that wayDaedalus your child is falling 
 And the Labyrinth is calling 
 Renegade heaps humanity abandoned 
 Bower of the vowels you lit them and fanned them 
 Mercury the courier celestial messenger 
 Bed with Dawn your bride 
 Arrowhead of Diane pierce the mind of a man 
 Tongueless muse of timeDiplomatically emphatically deny 
 any prior knowledge shape or kind 
 You dont know nothing about a Russian hooker 
 Some bloke broke in and straight up took her 
 Western European journalists 
 Devious little monkeys theyre bloody relentless 
 Call the consulate and burn the evidence 
 Dont speak another word just burn the evidence 
 Im not giving you attitude 
 I just want another drink 
 I dont care about the altitude 
 Get your hands off me you dont know who I am 
 Im a power player Im a power player 
 You can always tell the terrorist 
 By his cologne and the watch on his wrist 
 It says Im the type of man that can kick off anywhere 
 Kick off anywhere 
 Movers shakers money makers 
 Deal breakers and dogs 
 In this game youve got to lose 
 A couple of your pawns 
 A couple of your pawnsOrgan grinders henchmen shaking their coins in time 
 Guild of Mute Assassins will convene at a quarter to nine 
 Behind the court house atop a scaffold stands a man with a bag for a face 
 You will not have learned until I return to give my executioner the chase 
 The swinging of its censers the silence of its members 
 Oh the Guild of Mute Assassins 
 From the places inbetween that are so seldom seen 
 Oh the Guild of Mute Assassins 
 Widow in the furrow with thimbles hasnt seen her face in years 
 Kneels into a puddled reflection to find it is just as shes feared 
 And in the Garden the Archangel sword above his head 
 You will not return until you have learned what youve forfeited 
 Baby on a threshold with silver Breath rises from its lips 
 Beam of yellow light from a doorway and the figure of a silhouette 
 In the cradle a wood stiletto rattles like a barrow of bones 
 Another journeyman with passion silently recites the oath 
 Oh the Guild of Mute AssassinsOh but to just dance on steel 
 The Sky Pulaski way 
 By the fires of Elizabeth 
 Never cease to amaze 
 So hats off to the industrys casualties 
 Traloo tralay 
 Oh that swamp full of grabbing hands 
 Pull you under New Amsterdam 
 Chinese boxes hold their secrets well 
 How many are there You can never tell 
 Got to get religion 
 They gonna join that underground church 
 Even the mole people they got to get religion 
 Andy Warhol CBGB 
 Art class for the bourgeoisies 
 Lab rats for the cat 
 Real estate moguls Chump Towers 
 When the wind blows you can hear the windows go ratatat ratatattattat 
 Jimmy Hoffa in the Meadowlands 
 Weighing down that union man 
 Grab his ankles stevedores 
 Oh how those Jets do roar 
 Oh but to just dine on sewage 
 Cold seagull pie 
 Wrestle albino alligators 
 And spin the good lie 
 How many are there One can never tell 
 Got to got to got to get religion 
 They gonna join that underground churchIf kneedeep in cat nip 
 At the old icebox 
 I recommend you whistle 
 And give the box three knocks 
 Should you be so lucky 
 To hear whisperin 
 It is an invitation 
 For you to leap in 
 May you go marching in three measure time 
 Dressed up as asses drunk to the nines 
 Swing from the rafters shouting those songs 
 Gone unsung for far too long 
 If boxing your shadow 
 At the wall full of moss 
 And antlers approach you 
 Then I am at a loss 
 Drink to the dead all you still alive 
 We shall join them in good time 
 Should you go crossin that silvery brook 
 Its best to leap before you look 
 If surrounded by toadstools 
 At the old green glen 
 Im afraid there is little 
 That I can recommend 
 Save all of your courage 
 And sincere prayer 
 And where you goa treadin 
 Take the utmost care 
 So let us drink to the dead all you still alive 
 Its best to leap before you lookTin shacks and catfish bones 
 Been bout all I ever known 
 The junebugs rattle and roll 
 Around the old maypole 
 Thunder and lightning 
 I said the catfish are biting 
 I took a riverboat downstream 
 I think you know what I mean 
 The chicken hawks they are gathering 
 Above my head they are circling 
 Old friends coming out visiting 
 Say Hi talk about collecting 
 Stray dogs wont come near me 
 Was blind now I see clearly 
 Believe Im fixing to die 
 When youre living in the country its why oh why 
 Whoa Im sorry that I left my home 
 Whoaohohohoh 
 Look over yonder there 
 On the farther shore 
 I see a ship of gold 
 Beyond that mountain there 
 I see a CittyontheHille 
 Its gates are open wide 
 I hear the ringing bells 
 On toward the burying ground 
 Poor boy is all afire 
 Poor boy is dead and gone 
 Whoa Poor boy is dead and gone 
 Whoa 
 One of these days the Ship of Gold 
 Will carry me to my reward 
 Out of this world it will take me 
 To hear the horns of Jubilee 
 Pig fat and old pork rinds 
 Aint enough to keep a man alive 
 The bullfrog sleeps all day 
 Come night he has his say 
 Believe Ill take my rest 
 Whoa Im sorry that I left my home 
 WhoaohohohohFirst thing that I did was buy a pack of smokes 
 Check into a motel and consult my horoscope 
 Sitting on the bed with the briefcase in my hands 
 Patiently awaiting any word from high command 
 Telekinetic dynamite Psychic warfare is real 
 You better believe me brother xray vision 
 Telekinetic prophetic dynamite Psychic warfare is real 
 I know what youre thinking sister xray vision 
 Next thing that I did was tap out Morse code 
 With a wooden nickel on the receiver of the phone 
 Before I could complete it I was quickly overtaken 
 By the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan 
 And on the drums Gemini 
 On bass guitar presenting Pisces 
 On lead guitar we have Aries 
 And on the microphone Scorpio 
 Last thing I remember I was crawling from the ruins 
 I dont know whos to blame for that but I know who didnt do it 
 With every day that passes it keeps on getting stranger 
 But that really doesnt bother me cause I get off on the danger 
 I know what youre thinking xray visionWell my senses are sharpened 
 Im half in the bag 
 I got a Cheshire smile and 
 A five cent rag 
 Day of the jackalope 
 Abandon all ye faithful 
 Abandon all ye hope 
 Its the day of the jackalope 
 Well I heard about your problems 
 With your old man 
 Well hes a nonissue 
 As fast as I can 
 Abandon all ye people 
 Well the leaves blow in circles 
 In my footsteps 
 Like the mouth of a river 
 I have no regrets 
 Its the day of the jackalopeWont you open up the border 
 To rivers running green green green green green 
 I have kilo loads of plastic 
 To trade for pumpkins seeds seeds seeds seeds seeds 
 I know folks in Wichita as well as Santa Fe 
 All veterans of the trade 
 All right 
 Open it up open it up open it 
 Living for the trade 
 Just living for the trade 
 The merry wives of Windsor 
 I swapped for cans of Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam 
 While sipping fine darjeeling 
 With an English man man man man man 
 I know folks in Liverpool as well as in Bombay 
 In a tent on the caravan road youll find those things you thought were gone 
 Bartered for jasmine and silk and furs of frozen mastodons 
 I know folks in Wichita as well as in Bombay 
 Open it up 
 Opening the border 
 Were opening the border 
 Living for the trade

 Of buried treasures and Humpback whales 
 To famous people I do not know 
 I sign Sincerely Matthias Doe 
 I await their response 
 Some send none some send cops 
 There was one a senator 
 From the island of Corsica 
 She sent one from a shell 
 She blew right through it and ordered a spell 
 I N T H E B E G I N N I N G T H E R E I S 
 Nothingness 
 But after I I heard it all 
 I knew she was a false prophet 
 As was foretold 
 Shes not the angel that I know 
 Shes not the woman for whom I am born 
 Two Roman pictures guard the doors 
 Of these celebrities I adore 
 I give them misinformation 
 9 times of 10 it leads to persuasion 
 Wolves do not howl at the moon 
 But at the fluffedup poodles 
 I walked in like a king 
 Instead of pictures I take their things 
 I walked out to that  
 Arranging their things in the shape of songsAirstreams tethered together like silver sleeping oxen 
 All the best locations are located on the margins 
 Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene 
 Its a mean killer in the daylight but thats life for you and me 
 Its a reliable source of information 
 Fifty thousand unstoppable watts 
 Anthrax ham radio and liquor 
 What if I told you they been lying 
 About that double wide with water rights 
 And now the town cars are back again 
 They sold you some old line 
 About the greater good and sacrifice 
 Your friends from Langley are back again 
 Coming at you live 
 Its just some people can only see the stars 
 In the reflection from big black cars 
 Anthrax ham radio and liquorWhats the matter brother does the drought got you down 
 Open up the bomb shelter sweep it on out 
 Sing to the ocean in the afternoon haze 
 Up the iron pillars rise in the waves 
 Andromeda is weeping Inside one teardrop swims 
 Brave Useless in training less a millimeter thin 
 Release the kraken 
 Get the sacrifice on 
 Good gd yall 
 Useless the Younger we pray for you 
 You know we got your back in whatever you do 
 Bathysphere bobbing in Eyeball Bay 
 Black lash crashes forty foot waves 
 Cepheus is holding Cassiopeias free hand 
 As the Kraken breaks the surface making beeline to the land 
 In Greek legend the son of Zeus and Danae 
 He and his mother was set adrift in a chest but rescued by the intervention of Zeus 
 He was brought up by KING POLYDECTES 
 Who wishing to secure Danae got rid of him by encouraging him 
 In the almost hopeless task of obtaining the head OF THE MEDUSA 
 With the help of the gods he was successful and with the head 
 Which turned all that looked on it into stone he rescued Andromeda 
 And later metamorphosed Polydectes and his guests to stoneIn the raining park the chessmen play 
 The faithful atheists refuse to pray 
 The steamworks weep the addicts do not care 
 Crowd of cold people stand by and stare 
 The garbage eaters their many retainers 
 Come to collect all the foul remainders 
 The smoke hangs heavy the wrecking ball swings 
 In the clockwork of a collapsing thing 
 Wasted plastic empires golden age chemical wedding 
 Citizens in their refineries cheer the nuptial bedding 
 The hourglass is turning turning turning turning turning 
 On a shore of iron cutters and clippers 
 Paper rock rock paper and scissors 
 On a road of skulls their story moves on 
 Its a bumpy ride and very very very long 
 In the blue sky the seagulls fly over garbage 
 Are we the ocean Are we the desert 
 Are we the garbage Whos to say 
 The hourglass is turning turning turning turning turningImpetus 
 Justification the means are the end 
 Doctrine and dogma I will not relent 
 This world a garden in need of such weeding 
 This world a minefield in need of such sweeping 
 This ministration without full consent 
 Fire and brimstone I will not relent 
 Just as all good things must come to an end 
 I will administer as I see fit 
 I will not relent 
 I am driven 
 Impetus 
 I am drivenThe fog is rolling in 
 The tide is high 
 Dianes as fat can be 
 Aye Captain aye 
 The guests seem more than pleased 
 How is the wine 
 We shall be underway 
 On the by and by 
 Ahead one third 
 ahead one third 
 Ahead two thirds 
 ahead two thirds 
 Full ahead flank 
 And out from the belly of the whale came a prophet 
 Amen 
 Go shoot the moon the sun 
 The Great Divide 
 I believe theres a storm a brewin 
 Nine crows at nine oclock nigh 
 Dutch man at the mizzenmast 
 Six harpies are singin to the lee 
 I believe shes going down 
 I believe were gonna die die die 
 Fortune tellers make a killing nowadays 
 Me oh my 
 Howdy Doodys past the house of Aquarius 
 Bring me more whiskey and rye 
 Big news from the party boat 
 Oh sir do not distress 
 The food is fine 
 Oh but I must confess 
 I do find the wine a wee bit dry 
 Fifteen men on a dead mans chest 
 Yo ho ho and a bottle of rye 
 Drink and the devil had done for the rest 
 Shes sunk full fathom five five five 
 Big news from the party boatThis was always the last place 
 I expected to be 
 Once upon an apocalypse 
 So better make the most of it 
 So I said to the horsemen 
 Have a Coke and a smile 
 Why not stick around for a while 
 But they said You Got The Wrong One Baby 
 The New Generation is pushing up some daisies 
 And by decree of Rapture Inc 
 Were closing this here market permanently 
 Coming down like a ton of lead 
 More bang for your buck 
 More pangs for the dead 
 CocaCola and Armageddon 
 I like it like it yes I do 
 So they 
 Tried to teach the world to sing 
 In perfect harmony 
 But it was way off key 
 So here comes the big RC 
 The melting pot boils 
 The bible belt breaks 
 And young America begins to sing 
 We like it like it yes we do 
 Its The Real Thing now 
 Come and get itOutside of Needles 
 I nearly lost my mind 
 I pulled over on the shoulder 
 Yeah and I was there some time 
 A young thing came walking 
 From out behind the trees 
 She gave me consolations 
 And this is what she said to me 
 Firebirds Energy weapons 
 Both of these things are interesting to me 
 I dont care how you get them 
 I need them both and I need them urgently 
 Yeah I said I can get with that 
 Oh I like those things too 
 But I dont own a Firebird 
 Perhaps this Datsun will do 
 Outside of the valley 
 Yeah we got to overheating 
 She took off her sunglasses 
 And said I believe this bears repeating 
 Firebirds Energy weapons 
 I need them both and I need them urgently 
 Firebirds 
 Outside of Barstow 
 We got to living on the lam 
 Sometimes doing odd jobs 
 And sometimes living off the land 
 Yeah things went sour 
 And the girl she got to packing 
 When I asked her why 
 She said There are two things you are lacking 
 FirebirdsDodge Swinger 1973 Galaxy 500 
 All the way stars green gotta go 
 Dodge Swinger 1973 top down chassis low 
 Panel dim light drive Jesus on the dashboard 
 Tminus whenever it feels right Galaxy 500 
 Planets align a king is born

 Hop in well have ourselves a field day 
 Well find us some spacegrass 
 Lay low watch the universe expand 
 Skyway permanent Saturday 
 By the way Saturn is my rotary 
 Hop in itll be eternity 
 Till we make it to M83 
 Once around the Sun cruising climbing 
 Jupiter cyclops winks at me yeah he knows whos driving 
 Hit neutral in the tail of a comet 
 Let the vortex pull my weight 
 Push the seat back a little lower 
 Watch light bend in the blower 
 Dodge Swinger 
 Yeah yeahAint no doubt Jesus sees us 
 Acting foolishly on American Bandstand 
 Agog with spastic baskets the latest fashions 
 Here I am here I am here I am 
 But that chin music sound oh how it drowns 
 You gotta shake em on down 
 Scaling up the heights of folly 
 Na na na na na na 
 Kill the lights and bring the music down 
 Everybody be quiet 
 Sudden movement on the Serengeti get ready Freddy 
 Opportunity only knocks once 
 Never mind the fat ones just go for the slow ones 
 See how they run see how they run see how they run 
 While you were busy lighting Roman candles on the yellowcake 
 They shook you on down 
 When the rain start falling boatman calling 
 Got to shake em on down 
 The flood receding 
 The mountain appears 
 Send out the blackbird 
 Send out the dove 
 You Babel rabblerousers in polyester trousers 
 Big bright cities 
 Aint no doubt Vishnu missed you then Kali kissed you 
 Better get busy better get busy better get busy 
 Days get shorter air gets colder 
 Tune on into the NOAA radio 
 Hail hail hail hail hail hail 
 Shake em on down 
 Send out the doveI know we came here to get our good times on 
 Hold the whole world in our hand and greet the dawn with open arms 
 So make a contribution if you have been amused 
 But before we depart my brothers and sisters I have some heavy news 
 Oh how it breaks my heart this photograph 
 Several in the ministry practice a fuzzy math 
 And some of us wear the robes of righteous are a little more next of kin 
 To the Steelak the wicked one who makes a meal of our sins 
 Aint no telling how much longer 
 But we will never be will never be moved 
 Woe be the architect of our city cruel lever the hillock strangler 
 Bold pusher of the cold bone index 
 Through the knotted bowels of the old alleyways 
 Read the future a false haruspex 
 Recall how he coaxed us out of the green plains 
 All of us dumb eyed at the sheer number so long ago it does not matter 
 Woe be architect in his slumber for the watcher never sleeps 
 And on that day there will be rejoicing and dancing streets 
 Hey hey hey get your evolution on 
 Hey hey hey hey hey get your evolution on 
 Good St Charles Darwin wrote his gospel down 
 So keep your eyes turned to the sky and your ears down to the ground 
 Hey hey hey hey get your evolution on 
 Aint no telling 
 aint no telling 
 how much longer 
 how much longer 
 But we will never be will never be movedHow would you like to go bobbing for apples the shape of fish 
 Throw a coin into the well close your eyes and make a wish 
 How would you like to dine 
 A la Frankenstein 
 Downtown theyre giving em away downtown theyre giving em 
 Oh hey there Mama Nature why do you keep on shooting us that look 
 No we did not take it I swear we were only borrowing the book 
 So whos been planting magic beans to catch themselves a golden hen 
 Weve spent so many years going over this we cant start that all again 
 Downtown theyre giving em away downtown theyre giving emStanding waist high in snow 
 What brought me here I do not know 
 Sky is filled with starry scenes 
 Of heroes and their greatest deeds 
 Satellites move across the sky 
 And every year they multiply 
 Father bear is sound asleep 
 And will be so for several weeks 
 Across the plain I see a figure 
 Every instant growing bigger 
 Instinct tells me to run away 
 While faith proposes that I wave 
 He approaches to a rod 
 I whisper up a prayer to God 
 The stranger asks me with a grin 
 Do you have the time my friend 
 Himalaya is my old time stomping ground 
 Oh yes time is of the essence 
 Manitoba better snows Ive never found 
 Oh yes time is of the essence 
 The author looms above his page 
 And thinks it strange that at his age 
 He can not find the proper words 
 To describe his only world 
 One would think that in a life 
 Where no two snowflakes are alike 
 One would have a brilliant rhyme 
 For each and every bit of time 
 Oh yes time is of the essenceWont you come over and stay for a while 
 Take a seat have a drink wed have a nice time 
 Turn on the TV I believe its prime time 
 Ill make you chicken cacciatore in five 
 Theres a woman down at 314 
 Who cant keep the stains on her kitchen floor clean 
 And theres a man thats been knocking on his own door for three years 
 Or has it been four 
 I dont want to spend the winter in this house all alone 
 Those neighbors of mine keep coming on over and playing with my mind 
 I would like to love you I sure would treat you right 
 We could take the trash out every Thursday night 
 Here in my neighborhood there is the strangest thing 
 Green buckets every Friday at every driveway 
 Theyre filled with glasses plastics and newspapers too 
 They say they recycle and bring them back to you 
 I would like to love you I should would treat you right 
 We could be a family consume many goods 
 We could be the pillars of the neighborhood 
 Ah babe Im a real hard worker 
 With the proper tools Ill make you anything you yearn for 
 The barbarians are at the gate come in before its too late 
 I have food enough to last the two of us about a year 
 One thousand cans of chowder and one thousand cans of beer 
 I love my neighbors like I love my own brothers 
 But every year they are getting odder and odderEvery last blind pulled when I walk down the street 
 The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat 
 Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child yeah 
 Motherless child yeah 
 This place once had a name 
 The people once had faces 
 In every town I find its the same sad situation 
 Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man yeah 
 Countryless man yeah 
 My father tried to break me 
 My mother she tried to raise 
 The county correct me 
 From my wild ways 
 I once saw figures about a mile off 
 So I waited in the woods until they were gone 
 Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog yeah 
 Wandering dog yeah 
 From my wild waysFirst we get some surgery 
 Lose the kids then our identities 
 But one thing I know for a fact 
 Moustache stays right where its at 
 REO Speedwagon Kansas to Boston 
 My ankle bracelet already gone and lost it 
 Them yellow jackets keep the tired man from slacking 
 Stole my Camaro primer gray 
 Took my suitcase all my pay 
 Aint got no taillights grill full of fur 
 How could you do this to a man so close to being cured 
 We should get together and talk it over 
 At the Detroiter 
 Delaware Destroyers rocking with Dokken 
 You front the money and Ill do all the talking 
 Them Yellowjackets keep the tired man from slacking 
 Come a little closer honey I wont bite ya 
 One more lager and I might learn to like ya 
 How could you do this to a man so close to being curedBlackjack booted demons 
 Have surrounded my home 
 Got dogs and copters 
 And keep ringing my phone 
 Well I dont know if Im coming or going 
 If its them or me 
 Oh but one things for certain 
 Willie Nelson only smokes killer weed 
 Now theyre breaking my windows 
 Banging on my doors 
 Got me down and hogtied 
 Rifling through my drawers 
 Boss demon tells me 
 Oh how he would like to kill me 
 Save your bullets tough guy 
 My disease does that for free 
 Willie Nelson only smokes the greenest green 
 Willie Nelson only smokes killer weedThe leather soles go shuffling in 
 Stinking of smoke and ten cent gin 
 Now who will toast our noble host 
 Who has this morning given up the ghost 
 The wooden coffer hand to hand 
 Kind words are offered silent prayers 
 But she is satisfied the most 
 While stabbing madly at the roast 
 The rib of Adam the eyes of Eve 
 The sons of Cain receive no reprieve 
 The creditor rides with his men 
 The death of debtors he wont forgive 
 They repossess his silver eyes 
 Now in the potters field he lies 
 Waiting for a dead mans shoes 
 Have you heard the latest news 
 Lazarus is back from the dead 
 Looking as one would expect 
 Dripping with the waters of Sheol 
 Babbling about body and soul 
 And then he found his wife in their bed 
 Buck naked and already wed 
 The tax collector beneath his sheets 
 The door swings open floorboards creak 
 The sons of Cain will receive will receive will receiveWoke up this morning put on my Sunday shoes 
 Dont ask me why its just the nature of my grooves 
 I larged down the boulevard came under attack 
 But I rocked them senseless cause honey its tight like that good God 
 I hung a left down to Lemans Avenue 
 Stagger Lees everywhere trying to bring me doom oh no 
 And that Old Scratch he tried to purchase this soul 
 That dont confront me cause Im never in the need of a payroll 
 Heck yeah 
 Amen do it all again 
 Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
 Spit shine and a three piece suit 
 Good Lord I got to thank you cause you do it like you do 
 Hallelujah all the people in the back 
 Hallelujah its tight like that 
 Hallelujah all the people up front 
 Tight like that rapture rock 
 Tight like that 
 Hey honey its tight like that 
 Honey its tight like that 
 Hey Honey its tight like that 
 And all you knowitalls with politic views 
 Ideals dont situate themselves in His groove 
 So if you want to know you just got to ask 
 But if you dont lose that skin youll never be tight like that 
 Watch me work now 
 Dont try to sell me your New Age guru troubles 
 Cause Im already reeling doing that good time gospel shuffle 
 And all your thumpings about your Armageddon 
 Aint no big deal cause I already hang with Him 
 Oh yeah tight like that 
 Can I get a witness for the rock of ages 
 For the rock of ages 
 For the rock of agesRibonucleic acid freak out the power of prayer

 Well are you rolling tape now Bits and pieces large and small

 Temple of Syrinx having the bake sale of the year 
 Aint nothing you can do about it gonna be a big brawl over it 
 Like them little bitty babies in the king cake 
 Bonnie and Clyde the whole dome 
 The shackles of automata will shatter like their bones 
 Ribonucleic acid freak out the power of prayer 
 Robot Lords of Tokyo smile taste kittens 
 Half a mind to double up baby three times is jive 
 Temple of Syrinx having the bake sale of the yearWhos the man who stole fire for the people 
 Who causes trembling in the bones of evil 
 Who carved a mountain into a cathedral 
 I am immortal 
 Halfblind and spitting straight into the wind 
 Down down 
 Trying to drag me down 
 Its all right 
 I go to dreaming 
 I said its all right

 In dog years

 Enter a sour house to do battle with spectacular draculas 
 Lick tall walls to find them all sweeter than a cane 
 Pour the quick elixir in your wounds to ease the pain 
 Oh 
 Ooh plum been running buck a doz 
 Ooh smoke banshees honey bee sting buzz 
 Medicine of modern miracles voodoo to those out of focus 
 Experts explain experience  Hocus pocus hocus pocus 
 Mouthfuls down in a floating locus most of us deny 
 Medicine of modern miracles who knew circles with no foci 
 Trapped in sap chambered in a tree 
 Shadow of a giant across the centuries 
 Bits of shattered glass scattered on the shore 
 Break the genie bottle and open up the door 
 Ooh smoke banshees honey bee sting buzzBehind the Cliffside Inn 
 I heard a fiddle and a mandolin 
 Keeping rhythm on an old washboard 
 And stomping on the floor 
 Saw people of all sorts 
 Dancing round in twos and fours 
 Caroling about days of old 
 And what the future holds 
 In the middle was a big cauldron 
 That they were stirring stirring 
 And there were trees around 
 That they kept burning burning 
 I asked a toothless man 
 Who all these people were and 
 He said The soapmakers 
 And we are working working 
 As they stirred Heaven and Earth they combined to one 
 And everything was everyone and each one was all 
 As they stirred I heard a trumpet call 
 And everything was everyone and each one was allDid you not grant quarter to the demon giving treatment to its wounds 
 Go fetch my starsIf you thought it was boring in Jordan 
 Then come out here for a day 
 And by the way the names Marcus 
 But if you like you can call me sensei 
 Well the emperors in the pigsty 
 And the geishas in the shack 
 And you better believe Ill hold em there 
 Till the feds they pay me back

 Beebopaloobopawhopshamboo 
 And domo arigato if I got toWe have been waiting and it has begun 
 So humble thyself and hold thy tongue 
 We have been waiting and it has begun 
 Prostrate yourself your time has come 
 Look boldly look boldly look boldly on 
 Knelt at the crossroads knelt at the leather bound pew 
 Felt the pain of labor and of sons overdue 
 In full submission we are reborn 
 We are the ploughshare and yet we are the sword 
 Well thresh the psyche and till the pride 
 Distill the blood proclaim the gun divine 
 Damn the foul ego praise the promised swarm 
 So were lock stock and barrel 
 Hook line and sinker 
 Your freedom was your master 
 And your liberties the flint for 
 A double barrel sunrise a double standard land 
 You gave birth to the baby but put a gun into its hands 
 So the fruits of your labors have fermented into wine 
 And the sweat that was dripped is now the honey of the hive 
 The city is a burning sun and we are blooming flowers 
 The fire the flame the passion the power 
 Too little too late 
 High caliber consecratorIll march no longer 
 Ill fight no more 
 You can send out all the track snivelers 
 But Im done with war

 And now that we have totally lost all composure 
 We will wither from exposure beneath the sun 
 Ah ooh 
 If you see me at the bottom 
 Please bring me my running shoes ah ooh 
 And if you see me getting caught up 
 Yeah you know what to do ah ooh 
 Ill march no longer Im done with war 
 Send out your snivelers but Ill march no more 
 Ah ooh
