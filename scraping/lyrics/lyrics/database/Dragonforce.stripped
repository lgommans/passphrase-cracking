Proud and so glorious 
 Standing before of us 
 Our swords will shine bright in the sky 
 When united we come 
 To the land of the sun 
 With the heart of a dragon we ride 
 We are flying on wings in winter sky 
 With fire burning deep inside 
 We are warriors of endless time forever and on 
 On wings of steel an ancient flight 
 We see the powers that unite 
 The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more 
 Through the valley we ride 
 Full of glory we soar 
 Where the fights will be raging 
 For now and for more 
 And divided they fall 
 Tonight you will witness it all 
 Proud and so glorious 
 A land unknown we come so far 
 We ride the night till morning star 
 When colors fade to black and white 
 Your eyes come to sight 
 With the vision of a great divide 
 You turn towards the other side 
 You think you run but you cant hide 
 The dead can not ride 
 Lead sam 
 Over high seas and mountains 
 We fly to the heavens 
 On wings of a dragon tonight 
 Solos samhermansamherman 
 With the heart of a dragon 
 The heart of a dragon 
 The heart of a dragon we rideCan you imagine that its all up to you 
 Evil embrace of powers unnatural 
 Youre left in silence nothing more to behold 
 You close your eyes and visualize the day youll get away 
 Its here its near 
 I see it all so clear 
 Tonight your flight will take you higher 
 You live a life of fear 
 Tonight is the night that will inspire 
 Crying alone at night your destiny unknown 
 Your every being full of rage and hate 
 Seems like youre running but you just can not hide 
 Its in a raging fear all solitude is left behind 
 Can he comfort thee 
 And fill your life with ecstasy 
 Through the darkness 
 And the pain 
 Will you be the ones again

 Solos SamHermanHerman 
 Disciples of BabylonHer dream was to shine on the screen 
 Felt that was why she was born 
 Left all behind without a fear inside 
 But sometimes theres no lucky star to help you 
 Sun will go down and shes all alone 
 Cant help but feel insecure 
 Shell never stop the way to the top 
 Is more than she had bargained for 
 Her quest for the glory was real 
 But somehow it turned out all wrong 
 Heartache was never a part of the dream 
 Cant find a reason to keep on trying 
 Turn out the lights cause deep in the night 
 Just like the thousands before 
 Hold up your hand theres hope at the end 
 But be careful what you wish for 
 Now the lights are all gone 
 You find yourself on your own 
 Welcome the night cause not all that glitters is gold 
 Now the city has gone 
 You find your own way back home 
 Keep up the fight and youll find your kingdom of gold 
 Another night out on the streets 
 Finding a way to survive 
 Wasting your chances destroying your dreams 
 Counting the tears that you cried 
 Hiding the pain that drives you insane 
 But still youre craving for more 
 So give me your hand hold on till the end 
 And you can have what you wish for 
 Solos 
 Keep up the fight and youll find your kingdom of goldI feel the magic burning deep inside of me 
 No one can change the path of our true destiny 
 Dont be ashamed about the way we are 
 Another life awaits beyond the stars 
 Were calling 
 Were falling 
 A flood of passion now I feel the urge in me 
 A generation shamed by all reality 
 But now this lifes a raging battlefield 
 Though one day soon the truth will be revealed 
 The final judgement day 
 Riding on the wings of time 
 Feel the fire from the sky 
 Hold the power deep inside 
 Not afraid to die 
 We are the masters of the universe 
 On we ride towards the sign 
 Where the revelation hides 
 Were the guardians of the light 
 Till the end of time 
 Until we see the last sunrise 
 And set the world on fire tonight 
 Forever walking cold inside and all alone 
 A raging thunder far beyond our icy home 
 We close our eyes and feel the tears so cold 
 The ghosts of vengeance of the barren souls 
 Our one true judgement day 
 We reached for the moon 
 We conquered the stars 
 We cried for the tears of yesterday 
 Still strong to the end 
 Till well meet again 
 Remember the glory of the brave 
 We stand at the dawn 
 Our kingdom reborn 
 And wait for the sun to rise again 
 A light in the sky 
 So free and so wild 
 A light from our last eternal flameSuffer the raging anger creeping below 
 Trapped in the circle so helpless 
 Forces beyond 
 This is your last chance to die 
 I hear a thousand voices screaming my name 
 Dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone 
 Never to return again 
 Hide from the light in fear rohypnified 
 Filtered and disguised 
 Burning forever try to remember 
 Sadness in her eyes 
 So many times now weve been here before 
 No more illusions behind the open door 
 Trapped within my fierce desire resistance is futile 
 Screaming for your life nowhere to hide 
 Tonight we cross the line your innocence is mine 
 Falling down my life fading now to the end 
 One last chance of glory in my heart again 
 Set me free from craving the one thing I cant have inside of me 
 But is it all a waste of time 
 Lost in the misery the fatal demise 
 Forced to a living that no one can understand 
 Hiding behind all the lies 
 Lifetime in slavery your cries are in vain 
 Lurking around the shadows onto the end 
 Fearless in fatal disguise 
 Wake from the dream the life you left behind 
 Time to understand 
 Lost in the laughter life everafter 
 Trials of a broken man 
 And through this madness a new day will rise 
 We shall remember the pain she held inside 
 Fear the pain inside my heart our sacrifice in vain 
 This everlasting strain driving you insane 
 Still lost in the universe we cry for a new day to come 
 Break free from our loneliness the last time 
 Pray tonight as we try to understand 
 Im alive forever my soul will ascend 
 Set me free from this craving the one thing I cant have inside of me 
 Just a memory 
 Or is it all a waste of timeStrangers they come with the rise of the sun 
 To escape from this madness forever 
 Rivers run dry ripping holes in the sky 
 As the empire is fading away 
 Silently march now where the lost souls run wild 
 In a time long forgotten forever 
 Pain brings us sadness at the dawn of the world 
 But this nightmare will still carry on 
 Through the day well find a way were lost beneath the stars 
 Faceless they fall now and we all stand as one 
 Long wasted tears but a light forever shining 
 One stand one last demand to end it all 
 Outside the world in the Fallen Land turn away from my despair 
 We stand alone in a silent dream lost within eternally 
 Whoaoh Whoaoh 
 Rise again and try to understand 
 A light for the world will save us tonight 
 Redemptions still so far away 
 Marching on inside of our loneliness 
 Still searching for all that remains 
 And time will pass me by but Im not so far away 
 Were the sons of the land our lifeblood runs into the ocean 
 Tomorrow were gone our souls rising up to the sun 
 Redemptions still so far away 
 Its just one wasted man in one wasted land 
 Suffering still burning so alive 
 Its just one wasted man in one wasted land 
 Until the end of time—inside the Winter Storm 
 Outside the world in the Fallen Land turn away from our despair 
 Inside the Winter StormOn wings of burning fire across the oceans far 
 The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star 
 Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun 
 To the island of the everlasting chosen one 
 Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail 
 The crown and the shining light 
 Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul 
 Prepare the eternal fight 
 Lost in a dream in a boundless sea 
 Rivers of pain are guiding me 
 Defending this land from the sins of man 
 Never surrender our dreams again 
 Ride forever onwards stare into the sun 
 Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on 
 Rise another day across the distant skies 
 Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives 
 Insanity sublime shall make my bleeding heart 
 Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark 
 In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls 
 In the name of truth and justice never to be told 
 Can you not feel the eternal pain 
 Flows through your heart and every vein 
 Torture begins and it breaks you down 
 Nothing to save when the soul is gone 
 Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our livesIn times of fear and mystery 
 When the gods had ruled the earth 
 Sound the bells of victory 
 The sign of our rebirth 
 How many died in vain 
 Like waves against the shore 
 No one hears their whispers anymore 
 Lost like the hope in the battle we fought 
 Through the cold and the rain 
 Gone like the years in the shadows and pain unknown 
 Ive seen through the eyes of the dead 
 And suffered for them time and again 
 Granted with immortality 
 The price for the savior of humanity 
 Rise from the ashes of mankind 
 He walks into the fire 
 With the fate of us all in his hands 
 And the sadness fills his eyes 
 The prophecies of Babylon 
 As he stands at the edge of the world 
 Long is the journey oh long is the road 
 As the sun rises over the world 
 The quest is hard til the battle can end 
 But I have the power in my hands 
 Honor the god of Enlil 
 Silence for the beast is now the prey 
 Denied a chance for life 
 I take back that what is mine 
 Die 
 Wrath we rule the skies 
 May the rain cleanse and wash away 
 Imperfect these creations of mine 
 Corrupted by greed they shall pay 
 Chosen saved from deaths embrace 
 One last chance for man to change his ways 
 Deified a place amongst the gods 
 Saved from mankinds own demise 
 At the end of the journey for the savior of the earth 
 Sound the bells of victory through the signs of our rebirth 
 As the shadows fade away we watch the new sun rise 
 No one fears the darkness anymoreHighway of emptiness outside the burning wall 
 Rise again this quest for our salvation 
 Running faster the savage laughter the daylight fades away 
 Nothing left but the life we left behind 
 Ever searching the hidden faces the hatred grows inside 
 Broken man and a family left destroyed 
 Light years away empty words between us 
 So turn away say goodbye for the last time tonight 
 Still lost within the lonelness a lifetime ago 
 Hanging on as we pass through the fields 
 These pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home 
 And the wounds never heal 
 So fly for the last time and the fire burns within 
 Silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland 
 Rise through the lost ages hope they will bring 
 Free forever more and the dream will never die 
 Devastation a lost connection a beatdown man returns 
 So confused and alone for one more time 
 Crushed defeated the fog surrounding a prisoner trapped inside 
 System down feel the veins erupt tonight 
 Time after time promises of freedom 
 Well leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight 
 Still mystified by lack of cravation they show after all of the trials weve been through 
 These memories and empty words were all lost in vain 
 And the scars never heal 
 Fly for the last time and the fire burns within 
 Woah and the dream will never dieSilence here in the sunset of my life 
 Ive been walking through the darkness 
 With your ghost by my side 
 How Ive tried but can never stop the pain I feel 
 I have tried so hard but the wounds never heal 
 Now the time has come for our last goodbye 
 As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies 
 I have tried in vain but this is the end 
 We will meet again 
 I will be again 
 Mother these are the final words Ill write 
 I know theyre full of sadness I know theyll make you cry 
 How Ive tried to hide the truth of my despair 
 The sadness kept on calling drowning out my prayers 
 Theres no place for me Im torn apart 
 And I wish I could have made things better 
 Theres no place for me and deep inside 
 This pain wont last forever 
 I will be againSoldiers of fire 
 Rage of the universe 
 Cold steel and bloodshed in a lost barren wasteland 
 Fear rising higher 
 Rage of the winter war 
 Death calls at nightfall our hatred still burns as we 
 March through endless skies 
 Mankind will fall death will arise 
 For a lifetime we fight without reason 
 Still we wait for the warriors return 
 Though were cast out and broken we still carry on 
 Alone in a lost fallen world 
 Flames burning higher 
 Curse of the winter land 
 Black torn and twisted in the fast fading twilight 
 Storm winds still blowing 
 Steel shapes our destiny 
 Death calls at nightfall our curse will be lighted 
 Disguise this timeless crime 
 Brave men will fall evil will rise 
 Still heroes were born with promises so blind 
 The light at the end of the road that we all must climb 
 Solos HermanSam  VadimSamHermanHere I stand no one will ever ease my pain blood is the answer 
 Until the end I fight for my life and I never will surrender 
 Vengeance is mine driven by sorrow and eternal hatred 
 Blood legacy hear my endless cries 
 Shattered dreams I am a shadow of the man I used to be 
 But I know tonight your pain will be my delight 
 Hear the symphony from the score of the damned 
 Unleashing the eternal fire 
 Ride on your way this is your curse of darkness 
 Ride through the night and one day youll be free 
 Look to the sky where our hopes burning bright 
 Hear the laments of innocence rise 
 All alone I am lost in the maze of this aeonian nightmare 
 Torn within bound to suffer till I die 
 For centuries just like the king of Ephira trapped for eternity 
 Haunted soul I have the force to slay your kind 
 As I look to the stars I feel your presence in my heart 
 How I wish I could hear your voice again 
 Like my tears in the night your memory still shining bright 
 On this lonely road I ride 
 Wandering through the circles of Hell 
 Ride on your way this is your curse of darkness 
 Ride through the night and one day youll be free 
 Hear the laments of innocence riseComing down the mountain on high 
 Towards the battle we go side by side 
 Our hearts are filled with honour and pride 
 Cause we know our time has come 
 Silent voices down from below 
 Rising up through the ice and the snow 
 Ancient angers cast upon all 
 Through the land of the slain 
 Through the dark night and through the rain 
 Fighting machine we are risen again 
 Striving forever more 
 We will survive 
 Stand and fight 
 Join the light 
 Into the battle with power and might 
 Sound the guns 
 Raise the cannons of war 
 With the north star to guide us 
 We ride on the sky 
 Blazing up through the heavens 
 Like eagles we fly 
 And the horsemen shall come 
 They will judge all your lives 
 Revelations will now be unveiled 
 Darkened night set to swallow the light 
 All is lost theres no one left to fight 
 Overpowered by the glory and might 
 Of the ones who stand tall 
 Fallen heroes scattered around 
 Deafened ears opens up to the sound 
 Painful cries rising forever more 
 From the victims of life and of war 
 We will survive 
 No more hope of freedom 
 Our dreams are washed away 
 The second age is coming 
 Its the dawn of a new day 
 Judgement stands before us 
 The second king will rise 
 Our swords will shine with honour 
 Hatred fills the sky 
 Solos SamHermanTogetherSamHermanSamHerman 
 Revelations will now be unveiledDark clouds and thunderstorms in the fires and flames were born 
 Through darkness traveling on the night 
 Hellfires and rain will fall time is coming for us all 
 Our journey for the guiding light 
 Firelight it is burning so bright in the dark of the night 
 As we fight for the glory tonight theres nowhere to hide 
 On the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave 
 Careful now if not you then who else will we save 
 Lost in this world to a stranger 
 Death by the sword a common danger 
 You know that everything is not what it seems 
 March on all night forever searching 
 Daylight ahead is only lurking 
 Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams 
 Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see 
 Rise up for the time of your life 
 Now the time has come for you to be free 
 In the minds of society we all live in harmony 
 Truth is that we all die in vain 
 You stand for what you believe 
 I kill for what I conceive 
 Is there then a title for this game 
 Far away in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain 
 Demon knights riding over the heights where the fallen are slain 
 Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail 
 Now you live all your days in the fires of hell 
 Lost in this world a to a stranger 
 Now the time has come for you 
 Now the time has come for you to be freeI saw the ravens in the distant sky 
 I searched the mountains for the eternal fire 
 I fought the dragon through the sands of time 
 We race through the wind to glory ride 
 We cross the valleys to the distant sun 
 We feel the power our revenge is sworn 
 We crushed the cities and the war is won 
 The fire in our soul were standing strong 
 Kingdom 
 Calling 
 Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas 
 Steel of the warriors you bow to your knees 
 Sail through the darkness the true prophecy 
 Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams 
 A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky 
 This dance of doom towards the ivory tower 
 A vengeful death awaits for all this time 
 The judgment has passed we all now die 
 A maze of torment for a thousand souls 
 The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls 
 The years of torture that had been foretold 
 A lifetime of fear they now behold 
 I saw the ravens in the distant sky 
 Cursed is the night in the sea of dreamsA black curtain falls on this city 
 But under the lights 
 Been searching for answers but this time you 
 You feel so alive 
 Just free your own mind its not easy 
 To give all you got 
 Cause no one can stop you 
 From climbing this mountain and making the top 
 Run strive for the fame 
 Blood of the game that we played time and again 
 Its up to you to break these chains 
 Reasons to live reasons to die 
 Live for the power and glory 
 Never give up reach for the top 
 Find your own path and tonight well make it 
 Find your own path and tonight well make it all right 
 Now everyone wants to be something 
 A feeling so strong 
 But only one thing really matters 
 A place to belong 
 Dont spend all your days in the shadows 
 Youre not on your own 
 But just keep on fighting 
 Cause you never know what you got till its gone 
 Reasons to live Reasons to live 
 Reasons to die Reasons to die 
 Live for the power and glory Power and glory 
 Never give up 
 Reach for the top Reach for the top 
 Find your own path and 
 Tonight well make it all right tonight well make it all right 
 Whoa find your own path and tonight well make it all rightSilent screams and shattered dreams of what we left at seventeen 
 Still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside 
 Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be 
 Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind 
 Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore 
 Across the seas their hearts will bleed this life were waiting for 
 Taste the steel in pain you kneel for glory we defend 
 Our fallen souls will rise to fight again 
 Stay here with me this night well be together 
 Future in our hands well fight with freedom drawing near 
 Stand here with me for we will live forever 
 Tonight we stand and face it all 
 Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames 
 All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall 
 Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same 
 Our own salvation drawing nearer hear the darkness call 
 Skies are falling thunder storming stand before the world 
 Were banished now to barren wastelands fight the demon horde 
 Riding on through blackened darkness cross the endless sands 
 We sail away our victory at hand 
 Stay here with me together well be stronger 
 Side by side weve conquered lands and stormed across the seas 
 Die here with me we feel this pain no longer 
 For now and ever we will be 
 In my heart in my soul I am out of control 
 Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun 
 Tears evermore we cry like before 
 Feel the breakdown of my body 
 Set me free 
 Fly across the mountains and towards the golden sun 
 Just scream 
 Set me freeHere we are far beyond the distant sky 
 Seen all the world and how the story will be over 
 Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed 
 Now we have found the light that guides us over 
 Through the falling rain we traveled far and wide 
 And through the blackest darkness stars above shining bright 
 Through the sun and winter rain will fall 
 All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call 
 Were walking hand in hand in dreams of endless time 
 How do we know when we will leave this life behind 
 Stare at life through eyes of mine 
 The hate the fear and the pain 
 Theres a feeling held deep inside 
 When life you live is in vain 
 When life you live is in vain 
 Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday 
 We close our eyes to see the light of brighter days 
 And all alone well be where time can never heal 
 With the trail of broken hearts flying free 
 Once again we walk this lonely road 
 There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold 
 Were lost in memories of what we left behind 
 Relive the dreams the endless screams of pain inside 
 Lives are filled with emptiness 
 The fear returns once again 
 Searching endlessly now we will see 
 Drown your mind in the pain 
 Drown your mind in the pain 
 The last temptation will be all thats left for me 
 When I see those tears you cry 
 When I hear those lies you lie 
 When I feel all creation now falling down on me 
 Is this the reason to be 
 With the trail of broken hearts flying free 
 The trail of broken hearts flying freeMarch on the fire in the sky 
 Live now tomorrow we may die 
 Stand strong desire to survive 
 Til the end of time 
 No more youll never walk alone 
 Starlight will guide us to our home 
 Reborn the sands of time are sown 
 Til we claim our throne 
 Aggravation termination 
 Generations in starvation 
 Mass salvation of the nation now 
 We will fly tonight towards the angels 
 See our stars shine bright into the sky 
 We will stand tonight and live forever 
 Were the masters of the stars and of all time 
 And we will stand tonight and live forever 
 Dark clouds the symphony of war 
 Stare now into the crystal ball 
 Stay strong and face the winter storm 
 Til the final call 
 Strike now the power from within 
 Hunt down and crush them for their sins 
 This time the battle we will win 
 So it now begins 
 Suffocation desperation 
 From sedation to predation 
 Blind destruction of creation now 
 Once lost but now were free 
 To the night we hold the key 
 Silently we wait the last command 
 Guardians of space and time 
 To the mountain we must climb 
 At the gates of glory we now stand 
 For the final stand 
 Were the masters of the stars and of all timeTrapped in this maze of existence entombed by misery 
 I was blinded by my fears 
 Lost in the dark through the shadows I heard you scream my name 
 Oh help me please out of this nightmare 
 All my life Ive been playing with fire 
 Set me free thats my only desire 
 The time has come for me 
 The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see 
 And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 
 Fear deep inside is it madness that fueled my ecstasy 
 Now Im drowning in my sorrows 
 Lord answer my prayers lost in despair is this the end 
 Breaking the silence so real well make it together 
 All my dreams have been torn into pieces 
 Hear the screams of my eternal pain 
 Yeah 
 I have seen the sorrow in your eyes 
 How I wish Id made things better 
 Find the strength to leave the past behind 
 Just one more time well live again 
 ForeverOn a cold winter morning in a time before the light 
 In flames of deaths eternal reign we ride towards the fight 
 When the darkness has fallen down and the times are tough alright 
 The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight 
 Fighting hard fighting on for the steel through the wastelands evermore 
 The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores 
 On the blackest plains in hells domain we watch them as they go 
 In fire and pain now once again we know 
 So now we fly yeah were free were free before the thunderstorm 
 On towards the wilderness our quest carries on 
 Far beyond the sundown far beyond the moonlight 
 Deep inside our hearts and all our souls 
 So far away we wait for the day 
 For the lives all so wasted and gone 
 We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days 
 Through the fire and the flames we carry on 
 As the red day is dawning and the lightning cracks the sky 
 Theyll raise their hands to the heavens above with resentment in their eyes 
 Running back through the midmorning light theres a burning in my heart 
 Were banished from a time in a fallen land to a life beyond the stars 
 In your darkest dreams see to believe our destiny is time 
 And endlessly well all be free tonight 
 And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality 
 All alone in desperation now the time is gone 
 Lost inside youll never find lost within my own mind 
 Day after day this misery must go on 
 Now here we stand with their blood on our hands 
 We fought so hard now can we understand 
 Ill break the seal of this curse if I possibly can 
 For freedom of every man 
 Through the fire and the flames we carry onSonic fires bring mass devastation 
 Manic search in sad desperation 
 Jeopardize the right to hide from a sad existence 
 Nothing left still searching for something 
 Deep beneath the cries 
 Wait for the deafening silence 
 Fly forever more 
 Crushed by the thought that youre all alone 
 Cravation in her eyes 
 I will be waiting tomorrow 
 Striving to understand 
 Wasting a life not meant to be 
 Twisted and so broken once again 
 And the promises weve cast away will shine a guiding light 
 Victim of your grief and denial 
 Take my hand this one last time 
 Face the world before us The Warrior Inside 
 In a lifetime of disaster its a battle to the end 
 Final stand my life must carry on 
 And forever this time 
 Battered beaten forced to submission 
 Stricken by your fatal decision 
 Suddenly its time to say your last goodbyes 
 Misery remains voluntary all illusion gone 
 Break through the blistering madness 
 Free forever more 
 Blinding my eyes with your filtering 
 Mutation cast aside 
 Ill still be waiting tomorrow 
 Slave to a toxic man forced to a life of yesterday 
 Theatre of salvation crushed and burned 
 Down this lonely road recede the day our dreams are brushed aside 
 Cant regain this emptiness in time 
 See through the skies far beyond the World tonight 
 Hear the sounds of freedom ring 
 In a silent dream 
 And a million miles away 
 See through the stars far beyond the World tonight 
 Reach for the stars and live our lives forever free 
 In our hearts for a thousand years 
 And a thousand lifetimes before 
 And the dawn of a new day will rise 
 A light for us allLost in a dream—finally it seems 
 Emptiness and everlasting madness 
 See the sadness grow watching as we know 
 Long before our journey for the world 
 Call for us—the power in all of us 
 So far beyond the blackened sky tonight 
 Glorious—forevermore in us 
 We are victorious and so alive 
 We’ll all find our sacrifice tomorrow 
 Our journey on towards a brighter day 
 Silent tears we left behind still so far away 
 Across the endless sands 
 Through the fields of our despair 
 Free for all eternity we stand yeah 
 Rise above the universe tonight 
 Starchaser 
 Fly towards the storm see the world reborn 
 Feel the pain inside the voice the sorrow 
 Across the distant shores find the open door 
 Stand alone in judgment for tomorrow 
 Years of pain still haunt us all we saw the last sunrise 
 Take me home in freedom for a lifetime 
 Praying on for the silence and the last tears will blind 
 So glorious this fight inside—united we stand 
 And we’ll all find our sacrifice tomorrow 
 Free from this world here for the last time 
 Oceans collide inside of us all 
 Believe who we are—the phoenix will guide us 
 Freedom will rise once again 
 BIG Solo 
 Save us tonight the last hope for all of us 
 Lightyears gone by we’re still holding on 
 Save us tonight a star shines in all of us 
 Far beyond our lives still our glory lives on 
 Our kingdom come we stand as one 
 And we will live for always evermoreEmptiness tears inside 
 On the night before she died 
 Strong the fire that burned so bright inside of me 
 Through the years through it all 
 You touched my heart you touched my soul 
 Never gave up the fight but tonight youll be free 
 All the tears in my own heart bidding 
 But I want you to know 
 High the mountain we must climb so far beyond the oceans tide 
 Were torn apart but soon well all be home 
 And our hearts forever more entwined 
 Well save the night we said goodbye 
 No matter where you are youre not alone 
 Long nights and a lonely cry 
 Cold thoughts of a brighter time 
 An empty picture in an empty frame 
 Would you take me away 
 All the pain through my own eyes searing 
 Till the end of our days 
 No matter where you I am not aloneIm searching through emptiness 
 And tried to forget us in vain 
 The light of the dark setting sun 
 Will bring my sadness to and end 
 Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt 
 As we wait for our lives to be better 
 The worlds are dying in the night 
 No winter lasts forever 
 The seasons pass and sunlight will shine 
 On my life again 
 So let the past now burn down in flames 
 Locked in a prison in a world of living fear 
 On the edge of my destruction marching on 
 Still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be 
 As I lie awake and curse the rising sun 
 Sadness inside from the truth that she hides 
 And this pain in my heart for no reason

 And I have nothing to atone 
 All your morals thrown in vain 
 I know my pleasure is my pain 
 But Im gonna make it on my own 
 The sun is up but I cant get enough 
 The skys the limit 
 Im on the top but I aint gonna stop 
 Ill never give in 
 Its in my brain its driving me insane 
 Hallucinations 
 Always the same but I aint got no shame 
 Destruction I must 
 I see the sunrise once again 
 Ive lived my life and now Im dead 
 Time to come down all on my own 
 This is nothing new for me 
 This is my reality 
 So open your eyes 
 And dont ever hide away 
 I am on my ownSince the darkness took our minds 
 They burned our courage many died 
 Had to leave it all behind rebuild our lives 
 Passing memories remained 
 It made my soul a burning flame 
 Haunted dreams of my desire 
 Reveal my name 
 Raise our swords we fight for life 
 Shields and armor shining bright 
 Strike like dragons Have no fear 
 Swords are made of steel 
 Fly across the high seas and mountains 
 Rise above the golden horizon 
 Far away beyond the gates of space and time 
 Through the wastelands forever and on 
 Still we fight for our freedom 
 The cry of the fallen souls bleeding 
 Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow 
 Will we face all the fears of the world 
 The cry of the brave 
 Since the time we saw the sign 
 Destruction of your feeble mind 
 Centuries have come and gone but nothings changed 
 Hopes and dreams have disappeared 
 Destruction of your kind is near 
 Trapped inside your suffering eternal flame 
 Search the darkness search the light 
 Fierce resistance what a fight 
 Glory for unholy seal 
 Lies all cast in steel 
 In the depths of your desire 
 So secretly you feed the fire 
 Burning through the memories of all our lives 
 Watch the day turn into night 
 You reach out for that guiding light 
 First to be the one to hear their blinding lies 
 Fear of darkness fear of light 
 Sucked in by their ancient might 
 Ruthless in what you may feel 
 When your mind they steal 
 The cry of the braveWe will sail on 
 Forever on to the land of the evening star 
 Into the endless we ride 
 Unveil the darkness behind 
 Abandoned glory hidden castaway we ride 
 Now will the sky surrender 
 Forever through the never 
 A silent whisper echoes through my restless heart tonight 
 I will see the glory rise 
 Well be one tonight 
 Dont you shut your eyes in silence 
 Tonight gather near come and live your fear 
 In a land of desire your heart filled with fire 
 You live for the right to be free 
 We will sail on forever on to the land of the evening star 
 The land of the evening star 
 Now and forever after 
 Asylums filled with laughter 
 Suspicion haunts my dreams 
 An echo through my mind 
 This starlit gaze reminds me 
 Are you so blind you cant see 
 The winds of change my friend 
 Will blow for you in the dead of night 
 I will see glory rise

 The land of the evening starTime after time as we march side by side 
 Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls 
 Night after night for the glory we fight 
 In a kingdom of madness and the tales from the old 
 Death by our hand for the higher command 
 As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall 
 Fire burning steel and the tyrant will kneel 
 Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword 
 Set sail for the glory pray for the master of war 
 Sunlight will fall by the wastelands endless rise to the heroes before 
 Cry thunder Sword in his hand 
 Titans of justice freedom we stand 
 Cry thunder Strong in command 
 Blessed by the union freedom of man 
 Reckoning day for the demons we slay 
 With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all 
 Chaos still reigns devastation and flames 
 For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls 
 March on through the hellfire blazing from the darkness beyond 
 Nightmares return of the thousand screaming rise for the heroes once more 
 Unholy darkness in the eyes of broken dreams 
 Outside of the wasted and torn 
 A land of tears still remains 
 Soldiers of destiny calling 
 And the fallen will rise up again 
 Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end 
 Titans of justice fearless we stand 
 Saviour of nations freedom of man 
 Warriors defending one final stand 
 Blessed by the union freedom of manTime for so many years we have wondered 
 Wondered why 
 Lost in the still of the night 
 Ready to fight 
 Burning steel agony revealed 
 A quest to reconquer our land 
 Marching north showing no remorse 
 Our destiny caught in our hands 
 And one day we will be free again 
 One more time we will be free again 
 And well break the chains 
 That bound us and tore us apart 
 Cry under the gaze of the moonlight 
 And bloodred skies 
 The deafening silence of anguish 
 Becoming mine 
 Straight ahead rising from the dead 
 An army of relentless souls 
 We must hold through the northern cold 
 Well fight them until the end 
 Cleansed by the tears of the fallen 
 Echoing fears of the warriors 
 Honor and glory will comfort us all 
 Living alone dying alone 
 We make our final stand 
 We gotta make a final stand 
 We make our final standOutside on a winters night as the rain begins to fall 
 Theres a chill in the air and a howl of a wolf 
 While the rain beats at the door 
 Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high 
 And the only sound that will break the air is the warriors bitter cry 
 When the dawn of a new day will see the light 
 Then the strongest hearts grow old 
 And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow 
 Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead 
 In the forest they dwell with a misty spell 
 Noone heard what once was said 
 And the eagle fly through the clouds while 
 The earth bleeds dark and cold 
 When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold 
 When the color of night will fade to light and 
 The weakest hearts go cold 
 And were standing one and all fighting till we fall 
 Hoping for a better day 
 Never giving in until we find the words till we find the words to say 
 Until we find the words to say 
 Burning starfire shine in the sky 
 For the lives of great men who stand by your side 
 When the night falls on we will ride 
 For no lost souls will live on forever 
 Acoustic Solo Sam 
 Dark night on the valley below still 
 The horsemen follow through 
 Its a forest that leads to the foot of the hill 
 That inside the magic holds 
 Seven strong they ride on along to the place 
 Where sorrow lies 
 And the shadows of the night will no longer hide 
 All their mysteries come undone 
 When the color of night will fade to light 
 And the weakest hearts go cold 
 Never giving in until we find the words 
 Till we find the words to say 
 Solo  Herman 
 For no lost souls will live on foreverBurning fires burning lives on the long distant roads 
 Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home 
 Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high 
 Forest plains of wilderness were striking out tonight 
 On towards our destiny we travel far and wide 
 Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die 
 In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come 
 With the forces of the blackest knights theyre staring at the sun 
 Far across the distant plains of ice were searching for the sword 
 When the time has come for battle now we follow with the horde 
 We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky 
 In the land of long ago forever in our souls 
 Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright 
 In ancient lands of warriors were riding on again 
 Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads 
 Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago 
 Were all lost in the darkness so far away from home 
 Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning 
 Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice 
 As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair 
 And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care 
 You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay 
 Theres a voice inside thats calling another wasted day 
 Cant you see the history the suffocating madness 
 In the land of fallen souls theres nowhere left no place to go 
 I have traveled far and wide across this wasteland 
 Still searching for the answers for the right to understand 
 Riding through starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky 
 A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died 
 Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done 
 Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come 
 Fly on wings of shining still are burning so bright 
 Were all lost in the darkness so far away from homeOne man remains 
 And the stars seem to change 
 Far beyond our universe tonight 
 And the cries of the brave 
 And the skies filled with pain 
 For the silent ones we pray for all tonight 
 New dawn rising 
 Destruction and pain 
 Long days passing 
 The fear of the rain 
 Soldiers fighting on 
 The price they will pay 
 Nuclear meltdown 
 The world uncertain 
 For the power of the tragedy of mans creation 
 Rise from the suffering for our salvation 
 Fearless we stand 
 Strong till the end 
 At the trial of all our lives 
 Now say your final goodbyes 
 Light the path for the journey home 
 Save a prayer for the lost alone 
 Find a way from the other side 
 Before the hero stands still blinding 
 Through the long nights across the seas 
 Shine a light for eternity 
 Find a way beyond the other side 
 Until the last man stands for all mankind

 For one thousand lies 
 Blind faith lost trust

 Years passed lost touch 
 Leads the path to insanity 
 Take another shot show me what you got 
 It was never gonna last forever 
 Open your eyes try and realize 
 Once is enough so tonight now I say 
 No more from a voice that breaks the awkward silence 
 No more never heard so loud before 
 Made the same mistakes a thousand times 
 Never meant to be like this so I say 
 No more tonight 
 And it feels all right 
 Dark nights long passed 
 Waking up from a pointless dream 
 Brighter days brighter times 
 Hides the fatal reality 
 Questions answers 
 False addiction to nothing real 
 Lights fade crushed to dust 
 Desperation in tragedy 
 No more Same old game we play together 
 No more Time will pass well still remember 
 No more But tonight this game is over 
 No more Strangers in the night forever

 The power to guide us until we touch the sky 
 The reason we stand with pride 
 Is the will to live and to reach for the stars 
 So never look back 
 And well keep on fighting until we touch the sky 
 Sometimes the pain 
 Runs deep inside and all seems in vain 
 Sometimes the fear 
 Darkens the path and leads us astray 
 Tears in our eyes 
 And our hopes are fading away 
 The revenge is sweet 
 Get back on your feet cause a war is upon us today 
 Youre always just one step away

 Strong as an army side by side 
 Still brave and defending 
 March on through the tragic lands 
 Cold tears in the north wind falling 
 Raise your souls high 
 See the new dawn arise through the 
 Sands of all time mystery of life 
 Everlasting sadness through light years gone by 
 Land lost in time once more back where we belong 
 Promises of yesterday well keep holding on

 So blind in delusion 
 Cursed by the emptiness inside 
 Cast out in confusion 
 Strike back with the power in hand 
 Break free from a past life dying

 Solo HermanLife is a misery dont know how its come to be 
 Death the epitome of all of our days 
 In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice 
 Close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise 
 You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be 
 And now that misery has taken a new stand 
 In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain 
 In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain 
 When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be 
 Weve come to the point of no return and you beg for just 
 One more time to escape from all this madness 
 One more time to be set free from all this sadness 
 And one last time to be the one who understands 
 My soul and my spirit will go on for all of eternity 
 Foreign the currency your payment in blood to be 
 Death is the destiny for all of our ways 
 And in the dark you hide away for who or what you cant say 
 When I see the power of the demon come alive 
 On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun 
 Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won 
 Can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee 
 In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just

 Long have we travelled through forgotten lands 
 From coldest valleys to burning red sands

 Triumph and agony death will prevail 
 Strike back with vengeance till death we defend 
 Until the day that the dragons will rise once again 
 Strike down the unbelievers 
 March on for justice we now stand

 Hold up the three hammers highUh we got a killstreak coming up if anyones interested 
 Its getting late at night by a freezing moon 
 The time is running out and the end is soon 
 An army in despair dont know what to do 
 Impure thoughts are raging in this empty room 
 The victims are escaping now we shall regroup 
 The times are getting tougher as we face our doom 
 A circus of horrors waiting just for you 
 The barrels bottom anything will do 
 So take my hand and I will lead you right into 
 Extraction zone the zone 
 You can make yourself at home 
 Extraction zone your zone 
 You dont have to feel alone 
 Where dreams become reality 
 And standards will now cease to be 
 So live your life in the extraction zone 
 Another place another time we carry on 
 Not getting any easier cause were getting on 
 A creature from another world its gone all wrong 
 As a new dawn will rise 
 I promise myself not again 
 But deep in my heart 
 The fire still burns just the same 
 Its just the same 
 So live your life in the extraction zoneFinally all the World will see 
 Rise again before the endless silence 
 Burn the soul before well all be free 
 Light the path beneath the blackened burning sky 
 One final sacrifice this night belongs to me turn back before the dawn of winter 
 So far away the cry set fallen angels free through my mind tonight our journey ever after 
 Neverending solitude this is your life to be so cold and dark the voice of sadness 
 Suffering in endless pain the truth of all to be growing back to life through everblinding darkness 
 Free falling fates warning find a life to hold on 
 Soul stealers true believers rise now they are gone 
 And as they ride away forsake the one to save us winters mourning on a lost fallen world 
 Pray now united in a lifetime alone wont you wait for the silence so strong 
 Wait for the dawn 
 Tonight 
 Falling like the rain insanity lives on 
 Feel the shattered dreams one thousand voices crying raging endlessly they come 
 And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by 
 And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies 
 Glorious eternally well rise above the World 
 Marching on till victory we fight 
 The Fire still burns 
 Looking back our passing lives their memories to see flick through the passages of silence 
 Hidden by the sacrifice to set the Demons free now they understand reclaim the land relentless 
 Fear calling transforming stand alone in our time 
 Advocation desolation slay the vision divine 
 And all the stars fall around the World tonight silent forces from a past life return 
 Pray for the silence in a world so alone till we touch the horizon beyond 
 Fly through the storm 
 Marching unto victory we fight 
 The tears in your eyes a lifetime of misery 
 In the silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny 
 A lifetime of lies one chance at this fantasy 
 The judgment will pass for the cries of the World that has faded for me 
 The Fire still burnsMessed up once again told me its okay 
 But this path that Im taking 
 Im lost in the deep end 
 One last chance nevermore told me its all right 
 In this sea of denial 
 Im cleansed in the fire 
 So why is it me 
 Am I blinded or too blind to see 
 Why was I born 
 Not a part of this society 
 Again and again 
 I tried so hard to reach for the stars but I failed you all 
 Tried to keep standing tall 
 Never had a real chance at all 
 But still Im searching 
 Same thing different day try to make a change 
 Left with nothing more to live for 
 But everything to die for 
 Humanity insanity the everlasting grip 
 Lost all will to keep trying 
 Our bed we must lie in 
 So why was I born 
 For ten thousand ways to say sorry 
 But life writes its own tragic story 
 Time marches onwards and nothing can ever be the same 
 But well pray for a brighter tomorrow 
 Break free from this lifetime of sorrow 
 Years pass us by but were all just a part of the game 
 Years pass us by but were all just a part of the gameEternal temptation their eyes to the sky 
 This nightmare is everywhere my eyes open wide 
 Crash on through troubled waters oceans collide 
 We stand alone until the end we fight side by side 
 Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies 
 Wherever you go we will be by your side 
 For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night 
 The sky will turn black as nightfall appears 
 The hatred surrounding they hide in great fear 
 The evil all around the sound they will hear 
 Will not be for long now the time it is near 
 Raising hell forever still millenniums go by 
 Fire in the heavens bleeding ears hear the cry 
 For the Spirit of Ninja tonight 
 With the ninja forever tonightCan you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind 
 In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold 
 Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind 
 Time after time we stood united on we go 
 FLY far away dont let the world pass you by 
 LIVE for the day we must stand and survive 
 Now we face the judgement day our souls will feel the pain 
 Hear the screams of my world through the rain 
 Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain 
 Pain in my heart bleeding through 
 One day well be back for one moment in time 
 Endlessly searching for you 
 Who can cure my emptiness inside for this time 
 Suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die 
 No more feelings left inside my blackened heart I can not hide 
 Time after time our souls divided on we cry 
 FLY far away dont leave your own past behind 
 LIVE for the day another year passes by 
 Now we turn to face our fear theres nothing more to say 
 Still your dreams and my nightmares remain 
 Endlessly searching for youInception 
 Deaths guiding us the way 
 We fight till the end 
 Among the ruins 
 Illusion 
 Of brighter days ahead 
 Through confusion and hatred we try to understand 
 In silence we stand alone 
 Caught in the eye 
 A quest for life beneath a stormy sky 
 The strength to rise again 
 Time to realize 
 Our race has come to nothing 
 Well start it all again 
 The sun is dead now 
 Fading away forever 
 The darkness prevails now 
 But with the prayers of the dead 
 Now a new light ascends from the stars 
 Confusion 
 The sadness and the pain 
 Matricide the earth is now dead 
 Remember the brighter days 
 When hope and joy were shining in our hearts 
 Times have changed now we suffer yet try to understand 
 The fragments of my past to realize 
 Its time to rise again 
 In the worlds demise 
 But in the end what did we learn 
 Now a new light ascends from the starsBursting through the fires avenging 
 Fatal warning battles are raging 
 Power of darkness rise for the fight 
 Well be strong and stand our ground 
 Death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker 
 Fight the day with power of immortal souls arise 
 Fire in our hearts the evil rages on forever more 
 Burning until the battle rage is gone 
 Through damnation we rise sign of the times master of bleeding eyes 
 Thunder on high look to the sky you never gonna take us down 
 And we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire storming 
 Fly beyond the lost horizons high 
 Heroes of the night are calling 
 See the promised land is falling 
 Reaching for the powers deep inside 
 On through the night 
 Blinded by the hate and desire 
 Burning in your heart like a fire 
 Challenging all the suffer and fear our horizons take control 
 Blood spills all around us and our enemies draw nearer 
 Sacrifice your life to have them carry you away 
 Take us to the place of death and carry on forever more 
 Burning on the dreams of memories long gone 
 And youll die for your crimes sign of the times master of endless lies 
 Fight to the end now we ascend together we will take them down

 Strangers to reason our bleeding hearts so cold 
 Life brings a change in season fear will blind the soul 
 In the silence one moment alone 
 Cast away scattered far on the wasteland 
 Sever the soul from the forgotten sickness escape this life 
 Challenge the dream before the long departed a mindless rhyme 
 Whoa oh oh 
 Hear the burning thunder roar 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh oh 
 Still lost in a fire storm 
 Tonight we feel the past return 
 Lost inside the dream pass by the life well live forever 
 Still the wasted time left burning below 
 One thousand shattered voices lost inside an endless wonder 
 Tonight her voice will take me home 
 Shine glorious we run we stare into the blackened sky 
 Save the last command the virtue blinding 
 So far beyond the sun still burning with the fire inside 
 Once alone again silent stares for our last journey home 
 Paralyzed intensified mutation frustration 
 Everlasting lifetime in the underworld 
 Well travel endlessly deluded disjointed 
 One man cant understand this sad misery 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Theyve taken my heart 
 Theyve taken my soul 
 And now we stand alone insanity 
 In time well see the past unwind 
 Alive still wandering our fallen land 
 One more time we stare into the blackened sky 
 For tonight in our hearts now we feel 
 One last time see our destiny revealed 
 Shine glorious we ride we stare into the blackened sky 
 So far beyond the sun still blinded with the fire inside 
 Once alone again the silence stares 
 Shine glorious tonight still blinded by the blackened sun 
 Save the last command forever rising 
 So far beyond they come still blinded with the fire inside 
 Silent stares for our last journey homeAppearing out of nowhere you came into my life 
 And took control before I realized 
 I remember clearly the things you used to say 
 But now I see the truth behind your lies 
 I try to make you listen I try to make you see 
 Its nothing but a total waste of time 
 You think that you know better and do what you do best 
 You love to bring us down but now its time you listen 
 Caught by the winds of the fury within 
 Leading slowly to your own demise 
 Why dont you see that you are your worst enemy 
 And that fight must come to an end 
 War now this is war straight from the core 
 Hear the wrath and the thunder 
 Punishment from the skies 
 I will crush your empire 
 Empire of disguise 
 Blinded and deluded you think youve seen it all 
 You think youre always right and cant be wrong 
 Poisonous and selfish you cannot face the truth 
 And blame the world for your pathetic life 
 You lie you cheat you backstab and youre completely fake 
 Relying on a fragile house of cards 
 You always point the finger how easy must it be 
 To spend your life blindfolded and disguised 
 For so many tears for so many lies 
 For so many prophecies never fulfilled 
 I promise you now youll pay for your crimes 
 It ends tonight 
 Now this is war 
 We wont take it anymore 
 War War War War War 
 Appearing out of nowhere you came into my life 
 Empire of disguiseFar away in ancient land in time of ice and snow 
 The evil live among us so we see the time for go 
 Flash of steel and thunderstorm the dragon soul lives on 
 Time to strike he now arrive the battle is to be won 
 Standing up for the right to kill the honor is stay by your side 
 In the shadow of the night we will arise 
 The evil of the demon eyes 
 We are the Shadow Warriors masters of the night 
 We die for freedom and for the glory of the fight 
 Our honor he alive forever stand before the world 
 With the Power of the Ninja Sword 
 Through the sun and wind and rain to gardens far away 
 Journey to the everlasting valley of father slain 
 Spirit fire and cross the night to raging fires below 
 Center of the ancient castle world in battle of long ago 
 With the Power of the Ninja SwordHear the cries of war 
 At the break of dawn 
 See the evil spread disease and fear to all 
 Through the centuries 
 Blood shall be the key 
 Now a leader of our destiny 
 As his army rose 
 Crushing endless foes 
 From the battle he will rain fires of hell from the sky 
 Bringer of the fire 
 For the great empire 
 Rising power of the fallen warriors souls 
 Warriors souls 
 Steel crushing steel see the great fire descend from the sky 
 Never surrender one day well be free 
 Flee from the swarm through the forces of terror 
 No sacrifice til the end 
 Fly far away through the raging storm 
 Til the end with the rise of the sun 
 On the winds rising higher through our astral empire 
 Break the chains now this war shall be won 
 Hunting down their prey 
 From beyond the grave 
 Crush them into dust a life of worthless slaves 
 Soon the world will see 
 Evil prophecy 
 Now we shall avenge a thousand warriors souls 
 Now dark knowledge is mine 
 Voices inside 
 Witness the fall for the last time 
 Back is the power 
 Now is the hour to decide 
 Once more to 
 Break the chains now this war shall be wonClose your eyes hear the thunder and rain 
 Fear inside of the torturing pain 
 For the cries of the world and the last lives remain 
 Chain your heart swear to die for their gain 
 Deep inside slowly fading away 
 And the last breaths in vain and the fear turns to rage 
 Locked in a world by the fallen evil souls 
 Torn right apart for your life insane 
 Burning in my mind now to bring my life to hold 
 Reach out and die in the flames 
 See through the lies and their ever staring eyes 
 Now is the time to defend your ground 
 Destiny will call to remind us all now 
 Fly free so far from here this life we know will end 
 In dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again 
 Through the fire through the flames like the sun will rise again 
 Lost in time lost in space to the end of all their days 
 See their endless ways insanity the quest deranged not meant to be 
 In flames well now forever burn eternally 
 So free your heart leave your life far behind 
 In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside 
 Now feel your soul lost in seas of all eternity 
 Every day this life defending and the flames of youth not ending 
 In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain 
 So alone in a world far away memories of a dream will remain 
 As the world falling calls and our lives are in vain 
 Fire in my soul will forever rise again 
 Nothing in my mind to remember now 
 Broken by the fear of the dark night calling 
 Ride free on endless seas the final curtain falls 
 Cut the ground from down below the time to lock and to load 
 Through the fire through the rain far across the distant plains 
 Feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane 
 Save the pain from all humanity that rides throughout our destiny 
 For freedom now we rise for all again 
 Everyday this life defending and the flames of youth not ending 
 In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain 
 And when the memories are all left behind 
 And the days have gone forever lost within my mind 
 Now feel your soul burn in seas of all eternity 
 We fight through the eternal painFull the moon the midnight sky 
 Through the dark they ride 
 Warriors of forever will sacrifice their right 
 One for all and all for one 
 The future time has come 
 Faces filled with torment 
 Your heart beats like a drum 
 Never you will look back again 
 Youll fight until the end 
 Together we will live on forever more 
 In this land we have defended 
 From all things dark and cruel 
 Now we are defenseless 
 In a land where dragons rule 
 In a land where dragons rule 
 Flash of steel in the midday sun the battle has begun 
 Blood spills all around us but still we carry on 
 No mercy we will show to them no white flag shall be raised 
 We fight for our freedom right control this evil craze 
 We all stand until the end 
 Allegiance to this game 
 Now were defenseless 
 In a land where dragons rule 
 Sun sets in the western sky the battles almost done 
 The victory will be glorious our enemies all gone 
 We all stand until the end

 Falling gradually endlessly the perfect disease 
 Everyones a winner but youre down on your knees 
 Sanity is passing one more shot if you please 
 For the one final game I wont be playing 
 Still the same tempting voice in my mind 
 Losing grip on it all 
 Carry on through the endless lies 
 Cause I cant see a reason why 
 Give me the night 
 Let me be me for one last time 
 A prisoner of myself lost in disguise 
 Just give me the night 
 Still living in a twisted dream 
 Theres no tomorrow for right now will be 
 The best time of my life 
 Hammering sickening torment and pain 
 Blind ambition to poison my brain 
 Cheating lying begging stealing day after day 
 For the one final dose I wont be saving 
 Pure darkness consuming my life 
 Dont wanna die here alone 
 Walk away from reality 
 Got a date with the enemy 
 Solos FredHermanSam 
 The best time of my lifeOn a cold dark winter night 
 Hidden by the stormy light 
 A battle rages for the right 
 For what will become 
 In the valley of the damned 
 A warrior with sword in hand 
 Travels fast across the land 
 For freedom he rise 
 And the sign from the master on high 
 He screams a loud and across hear the cry 
 For the kingdom of fire and ice 
 And the power to be alive 
 Four strong ride on carry on through the war 
 Four strong carry on living for ever more 
 On the wings of death 
 By the hands of doom 
 By the darkest light 
 From the darkest moon 
 Crossing silent seas 
 Over mountains high 
 All will stand as one tonight 
 On the black wind forever 
 We ride on together 
 Destroying your evil with freedom my guide 
 When the master will call us 
 He stands high before us 
 Our hearts filled with splendour 
 Our swords will shine over the light 
 Days breaks with golden strand 
 Over pastures green it glows 
 To where night returns 
 On the shadows faces appear 
 Warriors wearing full metal gear 
 Join together one and all 
 Before the glorious light 
 Rise up gather around come and hear what is said 
 Use your senses open your mind dont you ever forget 
 On the wings of life 
 By the hands of hope 
 By the brightest light 
 From the brightest sun 
 To the valley of the damned 
 Our swords will shine over the lightCan you now imagine your life 
 Desolate detached and all alone 
 Your best friend is your desperation 
 In a world of unbelievers 
 How are we to keep our dreams alive 
 Sometimes escape seems like the answer 
 Take one last chance 
 A chance to start it over 
 Somewhere somehow 
 A place we all belong 
 Within this land of shattered dreams 
 Where the days seem neverending 
 Can you ask yourself tonight what it means 
 Can we really leave this world behind 
 For just a moment in a lifetime 
 And a chance to be free 
 From all reality 
 Who said that what we all see 
 Is exactly what we must believe 
 Sometimes its hard to know the difference 
 In a world of mass illusion 
 Who are we to question what is real 
 Sometimes it feels like mass confusion 
 From all realityOutside the battle ragin death upon us 
 No surrender unchained and free 
 Insanity will lead to blind destruction 
 Crush the evil the foul disease 
 Our final destination reborn in darkness 
 Watching and waiting destroying with ease 
 The judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking 
 Mankind will fall to the spineless deceived 
 Fly through the storm power of the steel 
 Striking with vegence force them to kneel 
 Soldiers unite force of the world 
 Fight till the end we will die by the sword 
 Fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction 
 Stand as one no man left behind 
 Our final victory tonight awaits us 
 Slain in darkness behind the lines 
 Raise the dead ride beside of me 
 Fallen heroes of a thousand moons 
 Blaze ahead the price that they now pay 
 On the march to their doom 
 Light the fires of freedom on the shores of endless seas 
 Wings of glory guide us on the path to victory 
 Solos SamHerman 
 Outside the battle raging death upon us 
 Fight till the end we will die by the swordWe are riding for the battle field in force tonight 
 Fury of the darkest evil cry for war 
 Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight 
 On the road to lands unknown forever more 
 Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us 
 Onwards through the ice and snow forever more 
 Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now 
 Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war 
 On wings of glory we will carry on 
 Far across forgotten lands towards the distant sun 
 And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight 
 Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows 
 And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun 
 When the glory of the masters time has come 
 Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens 
 With the power of the universe we stand strong together 
 Through the forcing of power it will soon reach the hour 
 For victory we ride fury of the storm 
 Here we are the chosen ones we cannot fail now 
 Spilling all the blood on the fires below 
 Smashing through the boundaries with fire and fury 
 Killing all the mortals down the winding roads 
 Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong 
 On the path to victory towards the distant sun 
 With the power of the universe we stand strong together 
 For victory we ride fury of the storm歪んだ煙を見つめながら 
 あてにならない明日を占えば 
 いつもよりは少しマシなはず 
 泣き出しそうな空の下でも 
 I wanna make it tonight 
 終わらない夜に 
 You have no need to cry 
 終わらないメロディーを 
 足早に過ぎてく時間ときの中 
 増えてゆくのは嘘の数だけ 
 錆びついた夢にもたれながら 
 いらだちを隠せずにいたけど 
 Gloria I need to your love 
 お前の熱い heart で hold me tight 
 Lonely night もう二度とみせないで 
 Gloria I need your love 
 お前の熱いheartで hold me tight 
 Lonely night もう二度と見せないで 
 Gloria 
 Wow wow wow 
 Wow wow wow yeah 
 Oh gloria 
 GloriaSmashing through the boundaries 
 Storming through the burning fields 
 Stand before the Evil One on towards the morning sun 
 Falling under skies of pain 
 Soldiers searching endlessly 
 Crashing over seven seas 
 Torture in the winter skies riding over plains of ice 
 Shadows in the fields of the slain 
 Crashing steel and raging fury 
 Smash the cross destroy the army 
 Crush the legions of the twilight 
 Templars of steel will burn 
 Cry far away as we reach for the day 
 Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain 
 Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall 
 Rising through the darkened ashes praying that Ill see you all 
 Far away will our eyes now see the day 
 For today the everlasting eternal sun 
 Washed away the dreams of a brighter day 
 Forever hold the dream inside 
 The chance to fight another fight 
 The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives 
 Live tonight 
 Watch you die I watch you die inside 
 While fear controls your life 
 Then reject this animosity 
 That kills so many minds 
 We feel the power deep within 
 The fear you hold inside 
 Just to find the reason for the treason 
 Now you will be mine 
 Screams of pain and death descending 
 Rise again from hell defending 
 Burn their hearts within the fire 
 Warriors of light will be slain 
 Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again 
 Day after day but the memories never change 
 Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls 
 Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls 
 Live tonightSpend all our lives on what we believe in 
 Struggle day by day but never retrieving 
 Taking our chances and follow the footsteps 
 Ancestors will take us to this fight 
 At the time it was blistering snowing 
 Never really know about where we were going 
 Time is coming now to cross over 
 Here and now until the curtain lowers 
 Slaying all the evil down below 
 Onwards we ride now to what we know 
 Strong enough to stay and carry on forever 
 Brace your soul to fight whenever 
 Never know how far we travelled we will have our stand 
 Across the deepest oceans gold is in our hands 
 Good things will come for those who wait we cant deny 
 Still the battle raging and the fire burns inside 
 Take you with me we will fly across the sea 
 To the land of the sun where our journeys begun 
 All fear is gone we sail until the dawn 
 Deepest fears will burn inside your mind 
 For the souls lost in endless time 
 Searching never ending for the chaos ascending 
 You forgot the spirits all times pretending 
 Passing shades of darkness in the world around you 
 Finally insanity in death has found you 
 On the edge of life trying to pull you under 
 Deep inside the storm theres a raging thunder 
 Sacrifice your innocence for persecution 
 As we now prepare for the revolution 
 In a time of fire were searching blind inside the mind 
 Run away to hells damnation one day we will find 
 Suddenly the skies are falling too late for us all 
 Crashing down on all creation as the towers fall 
 For the souls lost in endless time 
 Solos VadimKey Blast 
 Stand Before the worlds of freedom 
 Rise above them all 
 Ride towards the battle raging 
 Victory behold 
 Blackened Steel of death tonight 
 Our legions now descend 
 Far Beyond the gates of glory 
 Time to rise again 
 Solos SamHermanSamHerman 
 For the souls lost in endless timeLifes uncertain a rat race of pain 
 Endlessly searching for more 
 Hopeless and aimless held back by the chains 
 Until we cant take anymore 
 Hold on stay strong 
 Breaking out from a past life fading 
 No more what for 
 All we got is to keep on praying 
 Wait for their downfall their lives in dismay 
 Witness the final decay 
 Suffering in silence for years we were blind 
 But now we got something to say 
 Till the end not afraid of dying 
 Nothing left but to keep on fighting 
 United incited not misguided 
 Well fight through time before our one true destiny 
 Benighted ignited still strong and undivided 
 This day foretold now here for all to see 
 So free under blue skies but time marches on 
 Once more maybe well find our peace to behold 
 Strangers in a strange world defenders through time 
 Cleansed in a kingdom of fire 
 Legions of darkness from beyond the grave 
 Spill their blood under the sun 
 Voices are calling with anger and rage 
 The final war now has begun 
 Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire 
 Hear our call save us all 
 Standing tall tonight 
 The pain will slowly fade away the shadows of our lives 
 Will wash away the memories before the last sunrise 
 Well keep holding on in times of changes 
 Standing strong against the wind until the end of time 
 Were standing tall tonightIn a lifetime of decay silent cry for yesterday 
 When the world will see the end of eternity 
 Sacrifice before the dawn of a child soon to be born 
 Before the night too many tears we cry 
 In a long forgotten land 
 Through the silent raging pain 
 Of the price to pay that awaits for me 
 The end of all our destiny 
 Dont close your eyes tonight 
 For the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day 
 The time has come for us tread blood across the sands 
 Carry on as the red rivers flow 
 And through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain 
 In the silence ever searching on through the misery 
 And all the promises we made and cried in vain 
 Dont you take the time to realize the master of disguise 
 Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away 
 Out of the dark pain is the prize 
 Fly away out of the raging storm 
 Lost within my memories 
 Still haunting me 
 Never ending story 
 Far and wide forever on 
 Stand before the world alone 
 We journey to the other side 
 Raise your hands to the sky 
 Through the night and through the day 
 Dont look back no time to pray 
 The battle rages on 
 Marching on and on 
 Dont cry for me tonight 
 For the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow 
 The time will come for us the curse is growing strong 
 Carry on with the rise of the sun 
 So take me far away its time to set me free 
 All my life I have been waiting but I could never see 
 Raising your hands to the sky 
 Turning your eyes to the sun 
 Pray for forgiveness 
 The power to save us 
 Has gone for the last time 
 And blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away 
 Out of the dark pain is the price 
 Never ending storyOutside of this world theres a life force still burning 
 Outside of this land theres a star shining free 
 In silence we stand on a golden horizon calling 
 This time theres a light for us 
 Still shining so bright for us again 
 Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding 
 While there are so many faces in this mask of lies 
 Blinded by the promises and a life in pain 
 Now the time has come for all of us to rise 
 Through the fires of hell between us through a lifetime of our dreams 
 Endless tears still burn inside beneath the sadness of our screams 
 And the years of our forsaken lands 
 Silent we stand here alone 
 Nothing to say when the evil finally burns 
 We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone 
 One warrior standing through a thousand year storm 
 Our past lives still shining the starlight reveals 
 Our glory remembered for the power of the steel 
 And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen 
 Like the sands of endless time theyll never be forgotten 
 For the last time we cry now for freedom 
 Cast aside this dying world forsakes us 
 Break the chains of all creation now to save our lives 
 Fires of all eternity and the curse of steel 
 Like the winter rain well tear the blazing skies 
 From the wastelands of destruction with the fire we hold inside 
 Rise again still glorious for the power of all mankind 
 Through the years of our forsaken lands 
 Solos HermanSamFred 
 Through the trials of fire behind us in the dark and burning skies 
 Fallen tears still lost inside within the memories of our lives 
 For the last time we cry now for freedomTrapped inside a life which is not yours 
 Spirits within causing terror Fear and darkness 
 Evil dead 
 Voice speaks out All will die tonight 
 Insanity fills your mind You hear them calling 
 Covered in blood All hope is lost 
 Forever to rot Controlled by the powers of the 
 Evil deadIn the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn 
 Its turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown 
 When the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey 
 Will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day 
 Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain 
 Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave 
 When the time has come to stand for the power we believe 
 We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see 
 Sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain 
 Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again 
 Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream 
 Their pain in the silent lands on wings of glory free 
 We can go on forever with the darkness so far away 
 And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end 
 Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas 
 Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free 
 Through the darkness shining the neverending light 
 On through the days of glory rise towards the fight 
 And one day we will find a way towards this distant golden age 
 The cries of war will sound the day 
 We stand before the dawn of a new world 
 On through the raging thunder across the seven seas 
 Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen

 Our journey ever onwards fight until the end 
 We stand before the dawn of a new worldFlying over darkened skies the battle will call 
 Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm 
 And the world falls under the starlight 
 Shining from heavens below 
 Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more 
 Cry for the touch of angels never before 
 And the stars fall on the horizon 
 Onwards and up through the pain 
 Ride the wind and fight the demon steel shining bright 
 Standing together forever onward flames burning strong 
 Hot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards 
 We stare into the dawn of a new world 
 Cry out for the fallen heroes 
 Lost in time ago 
 In our minds they still belong 
 When the sands of time are gone 
 Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power 
 Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand 
 Far and wide across the land the victory is ours 
 On towards the gates of reason 
 Fight for the truth and the freedom 
 Searching through the memories to open the door 
 Living on the edge of life like never before 
 And the crowd chants under the moonlight facing their fears all the same 
 Heavens fear now open wide and up for the call 
 All in stark reality the angels will fall 
 And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown 
 Blinded by the force of evil cries into the night 
 Never before have they seen the darkness now they are all gone 
 Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations 
 Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn 
 Hold on for the morning after 
 Never to let go 
 In the fires burning strong 
 When the tides of time roll on
