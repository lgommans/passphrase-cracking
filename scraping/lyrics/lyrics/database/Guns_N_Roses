Well, she's all geared up, walking down the street 
 And I can feel the slime, dripping down her sleeve 
 Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x) 
 Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone 
 And I can hear her boots as she's near her home 
 Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x) 
 Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door 
 Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore 
 Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore 
 I never should asked for black leather 
 Black leather 
 Ooh, black leather 
 Ow black leather 
 And you can try to hide, but you won't get far 
 You can let her in, and you'll start again 
 Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x) 
 Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door 
 Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore 
 Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore 
 I never should asked for black leather 
 Black leather 
 Ooh, black leather 
 Ow black leather 
 Black leatherAll I need is some inspiration 
 Before I do somebody some harm 
 I feel just like a vegetable 
 Down here on the farm 
 Nobody comes to see me 
 Nobody here to turn me on 
 I ain't even got a lover 
 Down here on the farm 
 They told me to get healthy 
 They told me to get some sun 
 But boredom eats me like catsup 
 Down here on the farm 
 Drinking lemonade shanty 
 Ain't no body gonna do me harm 
 But I'm like a fish out of water 
 Down here on the farm 
 I write a thousand letters 
 Till my fingers all gone numb 
 But I never see no postman 
 Down here on the farm 
 I call my baby on the telephone 
 I say come down and have some fun 
 But she knows what the score is 
 Down here on the farm 
 I can't fall in love with a wheat field 
 I can't fall in love with a barn 
 When everything smells like horse shit 
 Down here on the farm 
 Blue skies and swimming pools 
 Add so much charm 
 But I'd rather be back in Soho 
 Than down here on the farm 
 On the fucking farm! 
 Are you born in a fucking barn or what? 
 Baaaaaa!Don't you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 The world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with 
 An endless monotony 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 There's nothing that's stopping me 
 All things are possible 
 I am unstoppable 
 Some may convince you 
 No one can break through 
 I'm here to tell you 
 You're worth more than they tell you 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 My life's a catastrophe 
 Can't understand why 
 It seems like it has to be 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 It's all opened up for me 
 Nothing's impossible 
 I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you 
 Do what they want to 
 You know you're stronger 
 Than the lies that they tell you 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 I just refuse 
 Some may convince you 
 No one can break through 
 You know you're stronger 
 Than the lies that they tell you 
 (I'd give anything to know) 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 (I would have never made it so far) 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 (I'd give anything to know) 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 (How you live with yourself) 
 I just refuse 
 (I would have never made it so far) 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 (All by myself) 
 Believe in yourselfDon't damn me 
 When I speak a piece of my mind 
 'Cause silence isn't golden 
 When I'm holding it inside 
 'Cause I've been where I have been 
 And I've seen what I have seen 
 I put the pen to the paper 
 'Cause it's all a part of me 
 Be it a song or casual conversation 
 To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations 
 Your words once heard, they can place you in a faction 
 My words may disturb, but at least there's a reaction 
 Sometimes I wanna kill 
 Sometimes I wanna die 
 Sometimes I wanna destroy 
 Sometimes I wanna cry 
 Sometimes I could get even 
 Sometimes I could give up 
 Sometimes I could give 
 Sometimes I never give a fuck 
 It's only for a while 
 I hope you understand 
 I never wanted this to happen 
 Didn't want to be a man 
 So I hid inside my world 
 I took what I could find 
 I cried when I was lonely 
 I fell down when I was blind 
 But don't damn me 
 When I speak a piece of my mind 
 'Cause silence isn't golden 
 When I'm holding it inside 
 'Cause I've been where I have been 
 An I've seen what I have seen 
 I put the pen to the paper 
 'Cause it's all a part of me 
 How can I ever satisfy you? 
 And how can I ever make you see 
 That deep inside we're all somebody 
 And it don't matter who you wanna be 
 But now I gotta smile 
 I hope you comprehend 
 For this man can say it happened 
 'Cause this child has been condemned 
 So I stepped into your world 
 I kicked you in the mind 
 And I'm the only witness 
 To the nature of my crime 
 But look at what we've done 
 To the innocent and young 
 Whoa, listen to who's talking 
 'Cause we're not the only ones 
 The trash collected by the eyes 
 And dumped into the brain 
 Said it tears into our conscious thoughts 
 You tell me who's to blame 
 I know you don't wanna hear me cryin' 
 And I know you don't wanna hear me deny 
 That your satisfaction lies in your illusions 
 But your delusions are yours and not mine 
 We take for granted we know the whole story 
 We judge a book by its cover and read what we want 
 Between selected lines 
 Don't hail me 
 And don't idolize the ink 
 Or I've failed in my intentions 
 Can you find the missing link 
 Your only validation 
 Is living your own life 
 Vicarious existence 
 Is a fucking waste of time 
 So I send this song to the offended 
 I said what I meant and I've never pretended 
 As so many others do intending just to please 
 If I damned your point of view, could you turn the other cheek 
 Don't damn me 
 When I speak a piece of my mind 
 'Cause silence isn't golden 
 When I'm holding it inside 
 'Cause I've been where I have been 
 An I've seen what I have seen 
 I put the pen to the paper 
 'Cause it's all a part of me 
 Don't damn me 
 I said, don't damn me 
 I said, don't hail me 
 Don't damn me 
 Smoke 'em if you got 'em 
 Alright, that suckedOh... 
 Don't you try and stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me 
 Breaking me down with an endless monotony 
 Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me 
 All things are possible, I am unstoppable 
 So they convince you no one can break through 
 I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you 
 Don't you try and stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe 
 Can't understand why it seems like it has to be 
 Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me 
 Nothing's impossible, I am inconquerable 
 No one can make you do what they want to 
 You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you 
 Don't you try and stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 So they convince you no one can break through 
 You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you 
 Don't you try and stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 Don't you try and stop us now 
 I just refuse 
 Don't you try to stop us now 
 'Cause I just won't let you 
 (Believe in yourself)I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I said I don't know what I did 
 But I know I gotta move 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I can't wait here forever 
 I got too much here to lose 
 An now you're blowin' smoke 
 I think you're one big joke 
 Me, I gotta lot to learn 
 And I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn 
 You say I walk a line 
 Fuck, they move it every time 
 You walk a mile in my shoes 
 And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues 
 Oh, you get what you pay for 
 And freedom's real high priced 
 And while your rippin' off children 
 Somebody's fuckin' your wife 
 It's never made a difference 
 It's only how you survive 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I said I don't know what I did 
 But I know I gotta move 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I can't wait here forever 
 I got too much here to lose 
 And now you ask me why 
 I said it's do or die 
 I'll stick it right in your face 
 And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place 
 And you, you can suck my ass 
 I think it's so low class 
 Me, I'm just so concerned 
 I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn 
 Oh, you want a confrontation 
 I'll give you every fuckin' chance 
 With your verbal masturbation 
 Me, I just like to dance 
 How's that for provocation? 
 I'm just makin' a stance 
 And I'm tired of the frustration 
 Of livin' inside of your lies 
 And I'm wired on indignation 
 I said somebody's got to die 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I said I don't know what I did 
 But I know I gotta move 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 I can't wait here forever 
 I got too much here to lose 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 Listen motherfucker 
 You're about to pay your dues 
 I got the shotgun blues 
 Shotgun blues 
 If you're goin' up against me 
 Don't you know you're gonna lose 
 I know 
 I know 
 I know 
 I know 
 You think anyone with an I.Q. over 15 would believe your shit? Fuckhead! 
 ...Nothin' but a fuckin' pussy.It's all the same, only the names will change 
 Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
 Another place where the faces are so cold 
 I'd drive all night just to get back home 
 I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
 I'm wanted, dead or alive 
 Wanted, dead or alive 
 Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days 
 And the people I meet always go their separate ways 
 Sometimes you tell the day 
 By the bottle that you drink 
 And times when you're alone, all you do is think 
 I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
 I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive 
 Wanted (wanted), dead or alive 
 I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
 I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive 
 And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back 
 I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back 
 I've been everywhere, (oh yeah), still I'm standing tall 
 I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all 
 'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
 I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive 
 And I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side 
 And I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive 
 And I'm right (and I'm right) dead or alive 
 I still drive (I still drive) dead or alive 
 Dead or alive 
 Dead or alive 
 Dead or alive 
 Dead or aliveI'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice, 
 I wanna be elected, 
 I'm your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce, 
 I wanna be elected, 
 Kids want a savior, don't need a fake, 
 I wanna be elected, 
 We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make, 
 I wanna be elected, elected, elected. 
 Good evening Mr & Mrs America and all ships at sea, 
 The candidate is taking the country by storm. 
 I never lied to you, I've always been cool, 
 I wanna be elected, 
 I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school, 
 I wanna be elected, elected, elected, 
 Hallelujah, I wanna be selected, 
 Everyone in the United States of America. 
 We're gonna win this one, take the country by storm, 
 We're gonna be elected, 
 You and me together, young and strong, 
 We're gonna be elected, elected, elected, 
 Respected, selected, call collected, 
 I wanna be elected, elected. 
 "And if I am elected 
 I promise the formation of a new party 
 A third party, the Wild Party! 
 I know we have problems, 
 We got problems right here in Central City, 
 We have problems on the North, South, East and West, 
 New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago, 
 Everybody has problems, 
 And personally, I don't care."It's a critical solution 
 And the east coast got the blues 
 It's a mass of confusion 
 Like the lies they sell to you 
 You got a glass jawed toothache 
 Of a mental disease 
 An they be runnin' round back 
 See 'em line up on their knees 
 'Cause the kiss ass sycophants 
 Throwin' penance at your feet 
 When they got nowhere to go 
 Watch 'em come in off the streets 
 While they're bangin' out front 
 Inside their slammin' to the crutch 
 Go on an throw me to the lions 
 And the whole damn screamin' bunch 
 'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs 
 'R' everywhere you turn 
 Tell me how a generation's 
 Ever s'posed to learn 
 This fire is burnin' 
 And it's out of control 
 It's not a problem you can stop 
 It's rock n' roll 
 I read it on a wall 
 It went straight to my head 
 It said "Dance to the tension 
 of a world on edge." 
 We got racial violence 
 And who'll cast the first stone 
 And sex is used anyway it can be 
 Sometimes when I look out 
 It's hard to see the day 
 It's a feelin' you can have it 
 It's not mine to take away 
 Lost in the garden of Eden 
 Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 And there's no one's gonna believe this 
 But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 This fire is burnin' 
 And it's out of control 
 It's not a problem you can stop 
 It's rock n' roll 
 Suck on that 
 Looking through this point of view 
 There's no way I'm gonna fit in 
 Don't ya tell me what my eyes see 
 Don't ya tell me who to believe in 
 I ain't superstitious 
 But I know when something's wrong 
 I've been draggin' my heels 
 With a bitch called hope 
 Let the undercurrent drag me along 
 Lost in the garden of Eden 
 Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 And there's no one's gonna believe this 
 But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 Most organized religions make 
 A mockery of humanity 
 Our governments are dangerous 
 And out of control 
 The garden of Eden is just another graveyard 
 Said if they had someone to buy it 
 Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul 
 This fire is burnin' 
 And it's out of control 
 It's not a problem you can stop 
 It's rock n' roll 
 Lost in the garden of Eden 
 (An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib, ya hear) 
 Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 And there's no one's gonna believe this 
 Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 This fire is burnin' 
 And it's out of control 
 It's not a problem you can stop 
 It's rock n' rollShe's got a smile that it seems to me 
 Reminds me of childhood memories 
 Where everything was as fresh 
 As the bright blue sky 
 Now and then when I see her face 
 She takes me away to that special place 
 And if I stare too long 
 I'd probably break down and cry 
 Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine 
 Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine 
 She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
 And if they thought of rain 
 I'd hate to look into those eyes 
 And see an ounce of pain 
 Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place 
 Where as a child I'd hide 
 And pray for the thunder and the rain 
 To quietly pass me by 
 Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine 
 Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine 
 Oh oh yeah 
 Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine 
 Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine 
 Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah 
 Ooh, sweet love of mine

 Mm, where do we go now? 
 Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (Where do we go?) 
 Ooh, where do we go now?

 Ooh, where do we go now?

 Sweet child 
 Sweet child o' mineImagine there's no heaven 
 It's easy if you try 
 No hell below us 
 Above us only sky 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living for today... 
 Imagine there's no countries 
 It isn't hard to do 
 Nothing to kill or die for 
 And no religion too 
 Imagine all the people 
 Living life in peace... 
 You may say I'm a dreamer 
 But I'm not the only one 
 I hope someday you'll join us 
 And the world will be as one 
 Imagine no possessions 
 I wonder if you can 
 No need for greed or hunger 
 A brotherhood of man 
 Imagine all the people 
 Sharing all the world... 
 You may say I'm a dreamer 
 But I'm not the only one 
 I hope someday you'll join us 
 And the world will live as oneBuddy you're a boy make a big noise 
 Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day 
 You got mud on yo' face 
 You big disgrace 
 Kickin' your can all over the place 
 Singin' 
 'We will we will rock you 
 We will we will rock you' 
 Buddy you're a young man hard man 
 Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world some day 
 You got blood on yo' face

 Somebody better put you back into your place 
 'We will we will rock you' 
 Singin' 
 'We will we will rock you' 
 Everybody 
 'We will we will rock you' 
 'We will we will rock you'When I look into your eyes 
 I can see a love restrained 
 But darling, when I hold you 
 Don't you know I feel the same, yeah 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 And we both know hearts can change 
 And it's hard to hold a candle 
 In the cold November rain 
 We've been through this such a long, long time 
 Just trying to kill the pain, ooh yeah 
 But lovers always come and lovers always go 
 And no one's really sure who's letting go today, walking away 
 If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
 I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine, all mine 
 So if you want to love me 
 Then darling, don't refrain 
 Or I'll just end up walking 
 In the cold November rain 
 Do you need some time on your own? 
 Do you need some time all alone? 
 Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own 
 Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone? 
 I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
 When even friends seem out to harm you 
 But if you could heal a broken heart 
 Wouldn't time be out to charm you? Oh 
 Sometimes I need some time on my own 
 Sometimes I need some time all alone 
 Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own 
 Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone? 
 And when your fears subside 
 And shadows still remain, ooh yeah 
 I know that you can love me 
 When there's no one left to blame 
 So nevermind the darkness 
 We still can find a way 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 Even cold November rain 
 Don't you think that you need somebody? 
 Don't you think that you need someone? 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 You're not the only one 
 You're not the only one 
 Don't you think that you need somebody? 
 Don't you think that you need someone? 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 You're not the only one 
 You're not the only one 
 Don't you think that you need somebody? 
 Don't you think that you need someone? 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 You're not the only one 
 You're not the only one 
 Don't you think that you need somebody? 
 Don't you think that you need someone? 
 Everybody needs somebodyMy heart is full of love for you

 (Swallow it bitch) 
 (I like the way that K-Y greases your lips)Well, when you're sitting there 
 In your silk upholstered chair 
 Talking to some rich folks that you know 
 Well I hope you won't see me 
 In my ragged company 
 You know I could never be alone 
 Take me down little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 Well, when you're sitting back 
 In your rose pink Cadillac 
 Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day 
 I'll be in my basement room 
 With a needle and a spoon 
 And another girl to take my pain away 
 Take me down little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 Take me down little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Say it with dead flowers at my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 No I won't forget to put roses on your grave--Childhood living is easy to do 
 The things you wanted 
 I bought them for you graceless lady 
 You know who I am 
 You know I can't let you slide through my hand 
 Wild horses 
 Couldn't drag me away 
 Wild, wild horses 
 Couldn't drag me away 
 I watched you suffer 
 A dull aching pain 
 Now you're decided 
 To show me the same 
 No sweeping exits 
 Or offstage lines 
 Could make me feel bitter 
 Or treat you unkind 
 I know I've dreamed you 
 A sin n' a lie 
 I have my freedom 
 But I don't have much time 
 Faith has been broken 
 Tears must be cried 
 Let's do some living 
 After we die 
 Wild horses 
 Couldn't drag me away 
 Wild, wild horses 
 Couldn't drag me awayTook my chances carelessly 
 Choked on my own cigarette 
 You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby 
 But you ain't seen the worst yet 
 Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun 
 And the woman who is dead 
 Who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one 
 And I ain't standing, never standing 
 In the shadow of your love 
 Shadow of your love 
 Shadow of your love 
 Shadow of your love 
 Wrote my changes helplessly 
 Yeah but I got no regrets 
 Money it was on the table 
 So I booked with all the bets 
 Living like a lemon ain't so hot 
 And you ain't my idea 
 Of one high-rollin' shot 
 No I ain't standing, never standing 
 Big dark clouds hanging over your head 
 Hope you've heard, baby all I've said 
 You've been told, what I've said 
 No use crying, you're as good as dead 
 Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun 
 And the woman who is dead, who is out all right 
 Now I'm not the only one 
 And I ain't standing, never standingShe hit town like a rose in bloom 
 Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume 
 The color faded and the petals died 
 Down in the city, no one cried 
 In the streets, the garbage lies 
 Protected by a million flies 
 The roaches so big 
 You know that they got bones 
 They moved in and made a tenement home 
 I said nice boys 
 Don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 I'm not a nice boy! 
 Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
 Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
 She met the man and she did the smack 
 Paid the price layin' flat on her back 
 Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
 They ended up just being a toy 
 Played so hard burned her life away 
 Lies were told no promises made 
 You know nice boys 
 Don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 I'm not a nice boy and I never was! 
 Young and fresh when she hit town 
 Hot for kicks just to get around 
 But now she lays in a filthy room 
 She kills the pain with 
 A flick and a spoon 
 And in the streets the garbage lies 
 Protected by a million flies 
 You know the roaches so big 
 You know that they got bones 
 Moved in and made a tenement home 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 I bet you mama said 
 'Nice boys don't play rock and roll' 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
 Nice boys!You like to hurt me, you know that you do 
 You like to think in some way that it's me and not you 
 (you know it isn't true) 
 You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it 
 You don't know why I won't act the way you think I should 
 You thought they'd make me behave and submit 
 What were you thinking? 
 'Cause I don't forget 
 You don't know why I won't give in 
 To hell with the pressure I'm not caving in 
 You know that I got under your skin 
 You sold your soul but I won't let you win 
 You talk too much, you say I do 
 Difference is nobody cares about you 
 You've got all the answers 
 You know everything 
 Why nobody asked you 
 Is a mystery to me 
 I'm sorry for you 
 Not sorry for me 
 (not sorry for me) 
 You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe 
 (or not to believe) 
 I'm sorry for you 
 (I'm sorry for you) 
 Not sorry for me 
 (not sorry for me) 
 You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe 
 You should believe 
 You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe 
 You close your eyes, all well and good 
 I'll kicked your ass like I said that I would 
 You tell them stories they'd rather believe 
 Use and confuse them they're numb and naive 
 Truth is the truth hurts. Don't you agree? 
 It's harder to live with the truth about you than to live with the lies about me 
 Nobody owes you 
 Not one god damn thing 
 You know where to put your 
 Just shut up and sing 
 I'm sorry for you 
 Not sorry for me 
 (not sorry for me) 
 You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe 
 I'm sorry for you 
 (I'm sorry for you) 
 Not sorry for me 
 (not sorry for me) 
 You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free 
 Won't set them free 
 You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free 
 You know you 
 Anyone else should be sorry for you 
 You've got no heart 
 You can't see all that you've done for me

 Back off, back off bitch 
 Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch 
 You better back off, back off bitch 
 Face of an angel with the love of a witch

 "Hey wha'd'ya think he's tryin' to say there, anyway?" 
 "I think it's something each person's s'posed to take in their own special way." 
 Fucking bitchPlease allow me to introduce myself 
 I'm a man of wealth and taste 
 I've been around for a long, long year 
 Stole many a man's soul and faith 
 And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
 Had his moment of doubt and pain 
 Made damn sure that Pilate 
 Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guess my name 
 But what's puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game 
 I stuck around St. Petersberg 
 When I saw it was a time for a change 
 Killed the Czar and his ministers 
 Anastasia screamed in vain 
 I rode a tank 
 Held a general's rank 
 When the Blitzkrieg raged 
 And the bodies stank 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
 What's puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game, oh yeah 
 I watched with glee 
 While your kings and queens 
 Fought for ten decades 
 For the Gods they made 
 I shouted out 
 "Who killed the Kennedys?" 
 When after all 
 It was you and me 
 Let me please introduce myself 
 I'm a man of wealth and taste 
 And I laid traps for troubadors 
 Who could kill me in vain 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
 But what's puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
 But what's confusing you 
 Is just the nature of my game 
 Just as every cop is a criminal 
 And all the sinners saints 
 As heads is tails 
 Just call me Lucifer 
 'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
 So if you meet me 
 Have some courtesy 
 Have some sympathy, and some taste 
 Use all your well-learned politesse 
 Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Hope you guessed my name, um yeah 
 But what's puzzling you 
 Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down 
 Woo, who 
 Oh yeah, get on down 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah! 
 Tell me baby, what's my name 
 Tell me honey, baby guess my name 
 Tell me baby, what's my name 
 I tell you one time, you're to blame 
 Ooh, who 
 Ooh, who 
 Ooh, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Oh, yeah 
 What's my name 
 Tell me, baby, what's my name 
 Tell me, sweetie, what's my name 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Ooh, who, who 
 Oh, yeahMama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, 
 Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. 
 Mama, life had just begun, 
 But now I've gone and thrown it all away. 
 Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry, 
 If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, 
 Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters. 
 Too late, my time has come, 
 Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time. 
 Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go, 
 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. 
 Mama, ooh, I don't want to die, 
 I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. 
 I see a little silhouetto of a man, 
 Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango. 
 Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me. 
 (Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro 
 Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me. 
 He's just a poor boy from a poor family, 
 Spare him his life from this monstrosity. 
 Easy come, easy go, will you let me go. 
 Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. 
 (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go. 
 (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go. 
 (Let me go.) Will not let you go. 
 (Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 (Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go. 
 Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me. 
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye. 
 So you think you can love me and leave me to die. 
 Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, 
 Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here. 
 Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, 
 Nothing really matters, 
 Nothing really matters to me. 
 Any way the wind blows.Ain't it fun when you're always on the run 
 Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you become 
 Ain't it fun when you get so high 
 Well... that you, you just can't come 
 Ain't it fun when you know that you going to die young 
 It's such fun 
 Good fun 
 Such fun (5x) 
 Yeah fun 
 Such fun 
 Such... 
 Ain't it fun when you take good care of number one 
 Ain't it fun when you feel like you just got to get a gun 
 Ain't it fun when you... just... just... just can't seem to find your tongue 
 'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung 
 Such fun 
 Someone come up to me, they spit right in my face 
 I didn't even feel it 
 It was such a disgrace 
 I punched my fist right through the glass 
 I didn't even feel it 
 But it happened so fast 
 Such fun (11x) 
 Such... 
 Fun 
 Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt 
 Ain't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the bum 
 Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun 
 Ain't it fun when you know that you're going to die young 
 It's such fun 
 Such fun (11x) 
 Good fun 
 Such funI'll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix 
 Jesus don't ya git tired of turnin' tricks 
 But when your innocence dies, you'll find the blues 
 Seems all our heroes were born to lose 
 Just walkin' through time, you believe this heat? 
 Another empty house another dead end street 
 Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell 
 This side of heaven, this close to Hell 
 Right next door to hell 
 Why don't you write a letter to me? 
 I said I'm right next door to hell 
 And so many eyes are on me 
 Right next door to hell 
 I got nowhere else to be 
 Right next door to hell 
 Feels like the walls are closing in on me 
 My mama never really said much to me 
 She was much too young and scared to be 
 Hell "Freud" might say that's what I need 
 But all I really ever get is greed 
 And most my friends they feel the same 
 Hell, we don't even have ourselves to blame 
 But times are hard and thrills are cheaper 
 As your arms get shorter, your pockets get deeper 
 Right next door to hell 
 Why don't you write a letter to me? 
 I said I'm right next door to hell 
 And so many eyes are on me 
 Right next door to hell 
 I never thought this is where I'd be 
 But I'm right next door to hell 
 Thinkin' time'll stand still for me 
 Fuck you 
 Bitch 
 Not bad kids just stupid ones 
 Yeah, we thought we'd own the world 
 And gettin' used was havin' fun 
 I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones, yeah 
 Flowin' through life not collectin' anyone 
 So much out there, still so much to see 
 Time's too much to handle, time's too much for me 
 It drives me up the walls 
 It drives me out of my mind 
 Can you tell me what this means...huh?If we could see tomorrow 
 What of your plans 
 No one can live in sorrow 
 Ask all your friends 
 Times that you took in stride 
 They're back in demand 
 I was the one who's washing 
 Blood off your hands 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 I still love you baby 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 I know the things you wanted 
 They're not what you have 
 With all the people talkin' 
 It's drivin' you mad 
 If I was standin' by you 
 How would you feel 
 Knowing your love's decided 
 And all love is real 
 An don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 I thought I could live in your world 
 As years all went by 
 With all the voices I've heard 
 Something has died 
 And when you're in need of someone 
 My heart won't deny you 
 So many seem so lonely 
 With no one left to cry to baby 
 An don't you cry tonight 
 An don't you cry tonight 
 An don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry 
 Don't you ever cry 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Baby maybe someday 
 Don't you cry 
 Don't you ever cry 
 Don't you cry 
 TonightLove, oh ohh 
 Is it true? 
 What they say of you? 
 Gonna call the President 
 Gonna call a Private I 
 Gonna get the IRS 
 Gonna need the FBI 
 There's not anymore that I can do 
 All the reasons that you gave, I'd follow you 
 To when you plead the fifth 
 That'd be the end of time, its true 
 Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong 
 Wouldn't be the last, I should have known 
 Through all the rumors I can tell 
 Some things didn't work so well 
 Well anyway, it feels the same 
 As when you first told me you were gone 
 So long ago, but I've still held on 
 Through all the emotions the love and the sex 
 That's the truth and here's the worst yet 
 Wouldn't even matter, the things that I'd say 
 You made your mind up and gone anyway 
 There's no use now in dragging it on 
 Could've seen it coming all along 
 Well it's true, oh 
 I had my doubts with you 
 Gonna call the President 
 Gonna call myself a private I 
 Gonna need the IRS 
 Gonna get the FBI 
 Gonna make this a federal case 
 Gonna wave it right down in your face 
 Read it daily with your morning news 
 With a sweet hangover and the headlines too, now 
 I bet you're thinking I'm doing this all for my health 
 I should've looked again then at somebody else 
 Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong 
 Feelin' like I'm living inside of this song 
 Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care 
 Feelin' like I done more than my share 
 Could it be the way that I've carried on 
 Like a broken record for so long 
 What can I do? 
 Ooh, oh. 
 I'm gonna call the President 
 I'm gonna call a private I 
 Gonna get the IRS 
 Gonna need myself the FBI 
 Ooh, what shall I do 
 I gave my heart to you, oh 
 It's such a crime, you know it's true 
 Gonna call the president 
 Gonna need myself a private I 
 Ooh, gonna need the IRS 
 Gonna get the FBI 
 Gonna make it a federal case 
 Gonna wave it right down in your face 
 Read it daily with your morning news 
 With a sweet hangover and the headlines too 
 There's not anymore that I can do1,2,1,2,3,4 
 (Whistle) 
 Guess I needed sometime to get away 
 I needed some peace of mind 
 Some peace of mind that'll stay 
 So I thumbed it down to Sixth and L.A. 
 Maybe a Greyhound could be my way 
 Police and Niggers, that's right 
 Get out of my way 
 Don't need to buy none of your 
 Gold chains today 
 I don't need no bracelets 
 Clamped in front of my back 
 Just need my ticket; 'til then 
 Won't you cut me some slack ? 
 You're one in a million 
 Yeah, that's what you are 
 You're one in a million, babe 
 You're a shooting star 
 Maybe someday we'll see you 
 Before you make us cry 
 You know we tried to reach you 
 But you were much too high 
 Much too high, much too high, 
 Much too high, yes, ow ! 
 Immigrants and faggots 
 They make no sense to me 
 They come to our country 
 And think they'll do as they please 
 Like start some mini Iran, 
 Or spread some fuckin' disease 
 They talk so many goddamn ways 
 It's all Greek to me 
 Well some say I'm lazy 
 And others say that's just me 
 Some say I'm crazy 
 I guess I'll always be 
 But it's been such a long time 
 Since I knew right from wrong 
 It's all the means to an end, I 
 I keep it movin' along 
 You're one in a million 
 Oo, you're a shooting star 
 You're one in a million, babe 
 You know that you are 
 Maybe someday we'll see you, Oo 
 Oh, Before you make us cry 
 You know we tried to reach you 
 But you were much too high 
 Much too high, Oo, much too high 
 Yeah, 
 Much too high, huh, no, no, oh 
 Ow! 
 Radicals and Racists 
 Don't point your finger at me 
 I'm a small town white boy 
 Just tryin' to make ends meet 
 Don't need your religion 
 Don't watch that much TV 
 Just makin' my livin', baby 
 Well that's enough for me 
 You're one in a million 
 Yeah that's what you are 
 You're one in a million, babe 
 You're a shooting star 
 Maybe someday we'll see you 
 Before you make us cry 
 You know we tried to reach you 
 But you were much too high 
 Much too high, ow, much too high, 
 Much too high, much too high 
 Yeah, yeee, yeah, yeee, high ! 
 Ow! Much too high 
 (Oh, much too high, ah, 
 Much too high, ah, much too high 
 Much too high, ow, much too high)(This is from "Live Fucking Like A Suicide") 
 You pack your bags 
 And you move to the city 
 There's somethin' missin' here at home 
 You fix your hair 
 And you're lookin' real pretty 
 It's time to get it out on your own 
 You're always fightin' 
 With your mama and you papa 
 Your family life is one big pain! 
 When you, you gonna move to the city? 
 Into the city where it all began 
 You gotta move, You gotta move 
 Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma 
 Time you gotta move 
 You stole your mama's car 
 And your daddy's plastic credit card 
 You're sixteen and you can't get a job 
 You're not goin' very far 
 You're always ridin' 
 With the teachers and the police 
 This life is much too insane! 
 When you, you gonna move to the city? 
 Into the city where it all began 
 You gotta move, You gotta move 
 Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma 
 Time you gotta move 
 Right to the city 
 Where the real men get it 
 Aw, child, ain't it a pity? 
 Sometimes it gets too shitty! 
 Come on and hit me! 
 You're on the streets 
 And it ain't so pretty 
 You need to get a new what you please 
 You do what you gotta do for the money 
 At times you end up on your knees! 
 I'm always buyin' 
 With the local and the junkies 
 This city life is one big pain! 
 But you, you had to move to the city 
 Into the city where it all began 
 You gotta move, You gotta move 
 Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma 
 Time you gotta move 
 Oh right to the city 
 With the real nitty gritty 
 Aw, child, ain't it a pity? 
 Sometimes it gets too shitty! 
 Come on and hit me!And now I don't know why 
 She wouldn't say goodbye 
 But then it seems that I 
 Had seen it in her eyes 
 Though it might not be wise 
 I still have to try 
 With all the love I have inside 
 I can't deny 
 I just can't let it die 
 'Cause her heart's just like mine 
 And she holds her pain inside 
 So if you ask me why 
 She wouldn't say goodbye 
 I know somewhere inside 
 There is a special light 
 Still shining bright 
 And even on the darkest night 
 She can't deny 
 So if she's somewhere near me 
 I hope to God she hears me 
 There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive 
 I hoped she'd never leave me 
 Please God, you must believe me 
 I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes 
 No matter how I try 
 They say it's all a lie 
 So what's the use of my 
 Confessions to a crime 
 Of passions that won't die 
 In my heart 
 So if she's somewhere near me 
 I hope to God she hears me 
 There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive 
 I hoped she'd never leave me 
 Please God, you must believe me 
 I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes 
 So if she's somewhere near me 
 I hope to God she hears me 
 There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive 
 I hoped she'd never leave me 
 Please God, you must believe me 
 I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes 
 So now I don't know why 
 She wouldn't say goodbye 
 It just might be that I 
 Had seen it in her eyes 
 And now it seems that I 
 Gave up my ghost of pride 
 I'll never say goodbyeI used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I had to put her six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complain 
 I used to love her, Ooh, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Ooh, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I knew I'd miss her 
 So I had to keep her 
 She's buried right in my backyard 
 Oh yeah, Ooh yeah, whoa, oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 She bitched so much, She drove me nuts 
 And now I'm happier this way, yeah 
 Whoa, oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I had to put her, Ooh, six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complainIf I say I don't need anyone 
 I can say these things to you 
 'Cause I can turn on anyone 
 Just like I turned on you 
 I've got a tongue like a razor 
 A sweet switchblade knife 
 And I can do you favors 
 But then you'll do whatever I like 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen 
 I might be a little young 
 But honey I ain't naive 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
 I might be too much 
 But honey you're a bit obscene 
 I've seen everything imaginable 
 Pass before these eyes 
 I've had everything that's tangible 
 Honey you'd be surprised 
 I'm a sexual innuendo 
 In this burned out paradise 
 If you turn me on to anything 
 You better turn me on tonight 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen 
 I might be a little young 
 But honey I ain't naive 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
 I might be too much 
 But honey you're a bit obscene 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen 
 I might be a little young 
 But honey I ain't naive 
 Here I am 
 And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
 I might be too much 
 But honey you're a bit obscene 
 I see you standing, standing on your own 
 It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be 
 If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend 
 I'll be here standing until the bitter end 
 No one needs the sorrow 
 No one needs the pain 
 I hate to see you 
 Walking out there, out in the rain 
 So don't chastise me 
 Or think I, I mean you harm 
 Of those that take you 
 Leave you strung out much too far, baby, yeah 
 Woah, no, woah, woah, baby, yeah 
 Don't ever leave me 
 Say you'll always be there 
 All I ever wanted 
 Was for you to know that I careGonna find a way to cure this loneliness 
 Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain 
 If I said that you're my friend 
 And our love would never end 
 How long before I had your trust again? 
 I opened up the doors when it was cold outside 
 Hoping that you'd find your own way in 
 But how can I protect you 
 Or try not to neglect you 
 When you won't take the love I have to give? 
 I bought me an illusion 
 And I put it on the wall 
 I let it fill my head with dreams 
 And I had to have them all 
 But oh, the taste is never so sweet 
 As what you'd believe it is 
 Well, I guess it never is 
 It's these prejudiced illusions 
 That pumps the blood to the heart of the biz 
 You know I never thought that it could take so long 
 You know I never knew how to be strong 
 Yeah, I let you shape me 
 But I feel as though you raped me 
 'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my songs 
 Now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside 
 Seems somehow I've found the will to live 
 But how can I forget you 
 Or try not to reject you 
 When we both know it takes time to forgive, yeah 
 Sweetness is a virtue 
 And you lost your virtue long ago 
 You know I'd like to hurt you 
 But my conscience always tells me no 
 You could sell your body on the street 
 To anyone whom you might meet 
 Who'd love to try and get inside 
 And bust your innocence open wide 
 'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
 My baby's gone off the track 
 My baby's got a locomotive 
 Gotta peel the bitch off my back 
 I know it looks like I'm insane 
 Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no 
 Gonna have some fun with my frustration 
 Gonna watch the big screen in my head 
 I'd rather take a detour 
 'Cause this road ain't getting clearer 
 Your train of thought has cut me off again 
 Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one 
 Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man 
 Sweetheart don't make me laugh 
 You's getting too big for your pants 
 And I's think maybe you should cut out while you can 
 You can use you illusion 
 Let it take you where it may 
 We live and learn 
 And then sometimes it's best to walk away 
 Me, I'm just here hanging out in my only place to stay 
 At least for now anyway 
 I've worked too hard for my illusions 
 Just to throw them all away 
 I'm taking time for quiet consolation 
 In passing by this love that's passed away 
 I know it's never easy 
 So why should you believe me 
 When I've always got so many things to say 
 Calling off the dogs, a simple choice is made 
 'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged 
 You know I tried to wake you 
 I mean how long could it take you 
 To open up your eyes and turn the page, hey 
 Kindness is a treasure 
 And it's one towards me you've seldom shown 
 So I'll say it for good measure 
 To all the ones like you I've known 
 You know I'd like to shave your head 
 And all my friends could paint it red 
 'Cause love to me's a two way street 
 And all I really want is peace 
 But my baby's got a locomotive 
 My baby's gone off the track 
 My baby's got a locomotive 
 Gotta peel the bitch off my back 
 I know it looks like I'm insane 
 Take a closer look I'm not to blame, no 
 Affection is a blessing 
 Can you find it in your sordid heart 
 I tried to keep this thing together 
 But the tremor tore my pad apart 
 Yeah, I know it's hard to face 
 When all we've worked for's gone to waste 
 But you're such a stupid woman 
 And I'm such a stupid man 
 But love, like time's, got its own plans 
 'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
 My baby's gone off the track 
 My baby's got a locomotive 
 Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
 I know it looks like I'm insane 
 Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
 Yeah 
 If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strange 
 Love's so strangeMan's got his woman to take his seed 
 He's got the power - oh 
 She's got the need 
 She spends her life through pleasing up her man 
 She feeds him dinner or anything she can 
 She cries alone at night too often 
 He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Man makes your hair gray 
 He's your life's mistake 
 All you're really lookin' for is an even break 
 He lies right at you 
 You know you hate this game 
 He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain 
 She cries alone at night too often 
 He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Black eyes all of the time 
 Don't spend a dime 
 Clean up this grime 
 And you there down on your knees begging me please come 
 Watch me bleed. 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleed 
 Only women bleedKickin' back in the shadows 
 Got no need for the light 
 Who's sorry now old timer 
 Look at how you've spent your life 
 Scroungin' for change 
 To put some money in your pocket 
 My how scratch does burn 
 Laughin' at the suckers as you pissed it away 
 But I got the time and I got the muscle 
 I got the need to lay it all on the line 
 I ain't afraid of your smoke screen hustle 
 It's a perfect crime 
 Goddamn it, it's a perfect crime 
 Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime 
 I said it's perfect 
 Keep the demons down and drag the skeletons out 
 I got a blind man followin' me in chains 
 I said he's fun to watch when the world has stopped 
 And I think he's got somethin' to say 
 "You wanna fuck with me? 
 Don't fuck with me. 
 'Cause I'm what you'll be 
 So don't fuck with me 
 If you had better sense 
 You'd step aside from the bad side of me. 
 Don't fuck with the bad side of me 
 Stay away from the bad side of me 
 Don't fuck with the bad side" 
 T-minus 1:09 and counting 
 Ostracized but that's all right 
 I was thinkin' about somethin' myself 
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 
 Call on everybody who's got last rites 
 Said it's better if you locked 'em away 
 Runnin' through the visions at the speed of light 
 Won't ya let me be 
 Motherfucker, just let me be 
 Goddamn it, better let me be 
 Don't ya know ya better let me be 
 Perfect crime 
 Goddamn it, it's a perfect crime 
 Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime 
 Don'tcha know it's a perfect crimeI see your sister in her Sunday dress 
 She's out to please, she pouts her best 
 She's out to take, no need to try 
 She's ready to make 
 It's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me baby 
 It's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me 
 Cars are crashin' every night 
 I drink and drive, everything's in sight 
 I make the fire, but I miss the firefight 
 I hit the bull's eye every night 
 Now it's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me baby 
 Yeah, it's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me 
 So easy 
 But nothin' seems to please me 
 It all fits so right 
 When I fade into the night 
 See me hit you, you fall down, huh 
 I see you standin' there 
 You think you're so cool 
 Why don't you just 
 Fuck off? 
 You get nothin' for nothin' 
 If that's what ya do 
 Turn around bitch, I got a use for you 
 Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do 
 And I'm bored 
 It's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me baby 
 It's so easy, easy 
 When everybody's tryin' to please me 
 So easy 
 But nothin' seems to please me

 When I fade into the night 
 So come with me

 Hell, so easy 
 It's so easy 
 So fuckin' easy 
 It's so easy 
 YeahYeah, c'mon 
 Why do you look at me when you hate me? 
 Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too? 
 I sense the smell of retribution in the air 
 I don't even understand why the fuck you even care 
 And I don't need your jealousy, yeah 
 Why drag me down in your misery? 
 Oh yeah 
 And when you stare don't you think I feel it 
 But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades 
 When I'm havin' fun, you know I can't conceal it 
 'Cause I know you'd never cut it in my game, oh no 
 And when you're talkin' about a vasectomy, yeah 
 I'll be writin' down your obituary 
 History 
 You got your bitches with the silicone injections 
 Crystal meth and yeast infections 
 Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections 
 Who are you to criticize my intentions 
 With subtle manipulative devices? 
 Just like you I got my vices 
 I got a thought that would be nice 
 I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice 
 Pain 
 And that goes for all you punks in the press 
 That want to start shit by printin' lies 
 Instead of the things we said 
 That means you Andy Secher at Hit Parader 
 Circus Magazine 
 Mick Wall at Kerrang! 
 Bob Guccione Jr. at Spin 
 What you pissed off 'cause your dad gets more pussy than you? 
 Fuck you, suck my fuckin' dick 
 You be rippin' off the fuckin' kids 
 While they be payin' their hard earned money 
 To read about the bands they want to know about 
 Printin' lies, startin' controversy 
 You wanna antagonize me? 
 Antagonize me motherfucker 
 Get in the ring, motherfucker 
 And I'll kick your bitchy little ass 
 Punk 
 I don't like you 
 I just hate you 
 I gonna kick your ass 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah

 We built a world out of anarchy, oh yeah 
 And in this corner, weighing in at 850 pounds 
 Guns N' Roses

 This song is dedicated to All the Guns 'n' fuckin' Roses fans who stuck with us 
 Through all the fucking shit 
 And to all those opposed 
 Hmm... well?Give me a little bit of volume on this 
 Heart-breaker, soul shaker 
 I've been told about you 
 Steamroller, midnight stroller 
 What they been saying must be true 
 Red hot mama 
 Velvet charmer 
 I say time's going to pay your dues 
 Now you're messing with a, a son of a 
 Now you're messing with a son of a bitch 
 Now you're messing with a, a son of a 
 Now you're messing with a son of a bitch 
 Talking jivey, poison ivy 
 You ain't going to cling to me 
 Man taker, born faker 
 I ain't so blind I can't see 
 Red hot mama 
 Velvet charmer 
 I say time's going to pay your dues 
 Now you're messing with a, a son of a 
 Now you're messing with a son of a bitchSail away sweet sister 
 Sail across the sea 
 Maybe you'll find somebody 
 That will love you half as much as me 
 My heart is always with you 
 No matter what you do 
 So sail away sweet sister 
 'Cause I'll always be in love with you 
 But let her be somebody else's queen 
 I don't want to know about you 
 'Cause too many others know what I mean 
 And that's why I got to live without you 
 I'm in love with a girl 
 Been talkin' about 
 I'm in love with a girl 
 That I can't live without 
 I'm in love but it feels like 
 I'm livin' it out 
 I'm in love but I think I picked a Bad Time 
 To be in love(No I won't) 
 You know you're all alone 
 Your friends they aren't at home 
 Everybody's gone to the garden 
 As you look into the trees 
 You can look but you don't see 
 Flowers seem to tease you at the garden 
 Everybody's there 
 But you don't seem to care 
 What's it with you man and this garden, yeah 
 Turned into my worst phobia 
 A crazy man's utopia 
 If you're lost, no one can show ya 
 But it sure was glad to know ya 
 Only poor boys take a chance 
 On the garden's song and dance 
 Feel her flowers as they wrap around 
 But only smart boys do without 
 You can find it all inside 
 No need to wrestle with your pride 
 No, you ain't losin' your mind 
 You're just in the garden 
 They can lead you to yourself 
 Or you can throw it on the shelf 
 But you know you can look inside 
 For the garden 
 I wasn't really scared 
 Lost my virginity there 
 To a gypsy with blonde hair 
 But now no one seems to care 
 Like a mouse inside a maze 
 Wandering 'round for days 
 With a smile upon my face 
 I never wanna leave this place 
 Only poor boys take a chance 
 On this garden's song and dance 
 Feel her flowers as they wrap around 
 But only smart boys do without 
 Turned into my worst phobia 
 It's a crazy man's utopia 
 If you're lost no one can show ya 
 But it sure was glad to know ya 
 Bye bye 
 So long, bye bye 
 It's glad to know ya 
 Bye bye 
 Bye bye 
 Aw, so longTalk to me softly 
 There is something in your eyes 
 Don't hang your head in sorrow 
 And please don't cry 
 I know how you feel inside I've 
 I've been there before 
 Somethin' is changin' inside you 
 And don't you know 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 I still love you baby 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 Give me a whisper 
 And give me a sign 
 Give me a kiss before you 
 Tell me goodbye 
 Don't you take it so hard now 
 And please don't take it so bad 
 I'll still be thinkin' of you 
 And the times we had... baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 And please remember that I never lied 
 And please remember 
 How I felt inside now honey 
 You gotta make it your own way 
 But you'll be all right now sugar 
 You'll feel better tomorrow 
 Come the morning light now baby 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 And don't you cry tonight 
 There's a heaven above you baby 
 And don't you cry 
 Don't you ever cry 
 Don't you cry tonight 
 Baby maybe someday 
 Don't you cry 
 Don't you ever cry 
 Don't you cry 
 Tonight(The Perils of Rock N' Roll decadence) 
 I know this chick she lives down on Melrose 
 She ain't satisfied without some pain 
 Friday night is goin' up inside her again 
 Well crack the whip, 'cause that bitch is just insane 
 (I'm serious) 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 She's pretty tied up and you can ride her 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 I can't tell you she's the right one 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 Once there was this rock 'n' roll band rollin' on the streets 
 Time went by and it became a joke 
 We just needed more and more fulfilling, uh-huh 
 Time went by and it all went up in smoke 
 (But check it out) 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 She's pretty tied up and you can ride her 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 I can't tell you she's the right one 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no 
 Once you made that money it costs more now 
 It might cost a lot more than you'd think 
 I just found a million dollars that someone forgot 
 It's days like this that push me over the brinks 
 (Cool and stressing) 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 She's pretty tied up and you can ride her 
 She's pretty tied up, hangin' upside down 
 I can't tell you she's the right one 
 She's the right one 
 She's the right one 
 I can't tell you she's the right one 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh noLoaded like a freight train 
 Flyin' like an aeroplane 
 Feelin' like a space brain 
 One more time tonight, look out 
 Well I'm a west coast struttin' 
 One bad mother 
 Got a rattlesnake suitcase 
 Under my arm 
 Said I'm a mean machine 
 Been drinkin' gasoline 
 An' honey you can make my motor hum 
 Well, I got one chance left 
 In a nine life cat 
 I got a dog eat dog sly smile 
 I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go 
 I smoke my cigarette with style 
 An' I can tell you honey 
 You can make my money tonight 
 Wake up late, honey put on your clothes 
 Take your credit card to the liquor store 
 Well, that's one for you and two for me by tonight 
 I'll be loaded like a freight train 
 Flyin' like an aeroplane 
 Feelin' like a space brain 
 One more time tonight 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 Bottoms up 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 Fill my cup 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 Ready to crash and burn 
 I never learn 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 I love that stuff 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 And I can never get enough 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 Never to return, no 
 Loaded like a freight train 
 Flyin' like an aeroplane 
 Speedin' like a space brain 
 One more time tonight 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 An' I'm lookin' for some 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 So's I can leave this slum 
 I'm on the nightrain 
 And I'm ready to crash and burn 
 Nightrain 
 Bottoms up

 Fill my cup

 Ridin' the nightrain

 On the Nightrain 
 Float me home 
 Ooh, I'm on the nightrain 
 Ridin' the nightrain 
 Never to return 
 NightrainI've been lookin' for a trace 
 Lookin' for a heart 
 Lookin' for a lover in a world that's much too dark 
 You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction, ooh yeah 
 You don't need my love 
 You gotta find yourself another piece of the action, yeah 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 Say where you goin'? 
 What you gonna do? 
 I been lookin' ev'rywhere 
 I been lookin' for you 
 You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction, I got you satisfaction 
 You don't need my love 
 You gotta find yourself another piece of the action 
 'Cause you're crazy, crazy 
 You're fuckin' crazy, oh my 
 You know you're crazy, oh child 
 I said you're crazy, hey, hey 
 Yeah, ooh yeah, ow 
 Whoa 
 Say boy where you comin' from? 
 Where'd ya get that point of view? 
 When I was younger 
 Said I knew someone like you 
 And they said, "You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction 
 You don't need my love 
 You gotta find yourself another piece of the action 
 'Cause you're crazy, crazy 
 You're fuckin' crazy, oh my 
 You know you're crazy, oh child 
 I said you're crazy" 
 Ooh, you're crazy, hey, hey, hey 
 You know you're crazy 
 Well, you're crazy 
 You know you're crazy, oh 
 You know you are 
 Bring it down 
 You're fuckin' crazyAll the love in the world couldn't save you 
 All the innocence inside 
 You know I tried so hard to make you 
 To make you change your mind 
 And it hurts too much to see you 
 And how you left yourself behind 
 You know I didn't want to meet you 
 Now there's a hell I can't describe 
 So now I wander through my day 
 Trying to find my way 
 Still these feelings that I felt 
 I said to you and no one else 
 And no it's not going to change 
 I know it's gone, still I'm used 
 And that's nice to hang on someone 
 A change that's bittersweet 
 That's called the blues 
 Don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 You know it's what you planned, this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore 
 I don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 You know it's what we planned, this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore 
 What this means to me 
 The more I know you believe 
 What I thought was you now 
 Has got more that it changed on you 
 What I thought was true 
 The more that I might know is you 
 What I thought was you 
 Is only memories, distantDiamonds and fast cars 
 Money to burn 
 I got my head in the clouds 
 I got these thoughts to churn 
 Got my feet in the sand 
 I got a house on the hill 
 I got a headache like a mother 
 Twice the price of my thrills 
 And it's a cold day 
 It's a continental drift 
 I said this traffic is hell 
 Can you give me a lift? 
 And I'll try to paint a story 
 Got your pictures to tell 
 Yeah, you got to make a living 
 With what you bring yourself to sell 
 I got some genuine 
 Imitation bad apples 
 Free sample for your peace of mind 
 Only $9.95 
 I got my camera back from customs 
 Got my law fees up to date 
 Hell, they musta seen me comin' 
 Ain't this life so fuckin' great? 
 When the shit hit the fan 
 It was all I could stand, yeah 
 Well, I'm a frequent flyer 
 My body's breathing while it can 
 But what I don't understand is that 
 My world ain't gettin' no brighter 
 If I could touch the sky 
 Well, I would float on by 
 While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy 
 If it were up to me 
 I'd say just leave me be 
 Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch 
 Gold and caviar 
 Now why don't you pour my apathy 
 And I'd have all my bases covered 
 If I could teach my hands to see 
 But now we're down in the deep end 
 Where they'd love to watch you drown 
 I said your laundry could use washing 
 We'll hang it up all over town 
 I said Hollywood's like a dryer 
 And we're down on Sunset Strip 
 And you'll be suckin' down the Clorox 
 Till your life's all nice and crisp 
 When the shit hit the fan 
 It was all I could stand, yeah 
 Well, I'm a frequent flyer 
 My body's breathing while it can 
 But what I don't understand is that 
 My world ain't gettin' no brighter 
 If I could touch the sky 
 Well, I would float on by 
 While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy 
 If it were up to me 
 I'd say just leave me be 
 Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch 
 When the shit hit the fan 
 It was all I could stand, yeah 
 Well, I'm a frequent flyer 
 My body's breathing while it can 
 But what I don't understand is that 
 My world ain't gettin' no brighter 
 If I could touch the sky 
 Well, I would float on by 
 While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy 
 If it were up to me 
 I'd say just leave me be 
 Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch 
 BoyI get up around seven 
 Get outta bed around nine 
 And I don't worry about nothin', no 
 'Cause worryin's a waste of my... time 
 The show usually starts around seven 
 We go on stage around nine 
 Get on the bus about eleven 
 Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine 
 We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone 
 He's been knockin' 
 He won't leave me alone 
 No, no, no, he won't leave me alone 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin' to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin' to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone 
 He's been knockin' 
 He won't leave me alone 
 No, no, no, he won't leave me alone 
 Now I get up around whenever 
 I used to get up on time 
 But that old man, he's a real motherfucker 
 Gonna kick him on down the line 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin' to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it 
 So the little got more and more 
 I just keep tryin' to get a little better 
 Said a little better than before 
 We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone 
 He's been knockin' 
 He won't leave me alone 
 No, no, no, he won't leave me alone, never 
 Oh, leave me alone 
 Stuck it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle 
 And it, it drove me outta my mind 
 I should've known better, said I wish I never met her 
 Said I, I leave it all behind 
 YowsaWe both lie silently still 
 In the dead of the night 
 Although we both lie close together 
 We feel miles apart inside 
 Was it something I said or something I did 
 Did my words not come out right 
 Though I tried not to hurt you 
 Though I tried 
 But I guess that's why they say 
 Every rose has its thorn 
 Just like every night has its dawn 
 Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song 
 Every rose has its thorn 
 Yeah it does 
 I listen to our favorite song 
 Playing on the radio 
 Hear the DJ say loves a game 
 Of easy come and easy go 
 But I wonder does he know 
 Has he ever felt like this 
 And I know you'd be here right now 
 If I could have let you know somehow 
 I guess 
 Though it's been a while now 
 I can still feel so much pain 
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals 
 But the scar, that scar remains 
 I know I could have saved our love that night 
 If I'd known what to say 
 Instead of makin' love 
 We both made our separate ways 
 But now I hear you found somebody new 
 And that I never meant that much to you 
 To hear that tears me up inside 
 And to see you cuts me like a knife 
 I guess(Now if you know anything about us we write most of our sond with based off an eliment of truth but this song is kinda like a fantasy and a joke cause its kind of a sick subject but you know sometimes when your boyfriend or your girlfriend is just a pain in a fuckin' ass and you wish you could chop there fuckin' head off and stick it in a bag and put it in the back yard.This is called "I Used To Love Her But I had To Kill Her") 
 I used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I had to put her six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complain 
 I used to love her, Ooh, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Ooh, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I knew I'd miss her 
 So I had to keep her 
 She's buried right in my backyard 
 Oh yeah, Ooh yeah, whoa, oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 She bitched so much, She drove me nuts 
 And now I'm happier this way, yeah 
 Whoa, oh yeah 
 I used to love her 
 But I had to kill her 
 I used to love her, Mm, yeah 
 But I had to kill her 
 I had to put her, Ooh, six feet under 
 And I can still hear her complainWhen you're talkin' to yourself 
 And nobody's home 
 You can fool yourself 
 You came in this world alone 
 (Alone) 
 So nobody ever told you, baby 
 How it was gonna be 
 So what'll happen to you, baby 
 Guess we'll have to wait and see 
 (One, two) 
 Old at heart, but I'm only 28 
 And I'm much too young to let love break my heart 
 Young at heart, but it's getting much too late 
 To find ourselves so far apart 
 I don't know how you're supposed to find me lately 
 And what more could you ask from me? 
 How could you say that I never needed you 
 When you took everything 
 Said, you took everything from me? 
 Young at heart and it gets so hard to wait 
 When no one I know can seem to help me now 
 Old at heart but I mustn't hesitate 
 If I'm to find my own way out 
 Still talkin' to myself 
 And nobody's home 
 (Alone) 
 So nobody ever told us, baby 
 How it was gonna be 
 So what'll happen to us, baby 
 Guess we'll have to wait and see 
 When I find out all the reasons 
 Maybe I'll find another way 
 Find another day 
 With all the changing seasons of my life 
 Maybe I'll get it right next time 
 And now that you've been broken down 
 Got your head out of the clouds 
 You're back down on the ground 
 And you don't talk so loud 
 And you don't walk so proud 
 Anymore, and what for? 
 Well, I jumped into the river 
 Too many times to make it home 
 I'm out here on my own 
 And drifting all alone 
 If it doesn't show, give it time 
 To read between the lines 
 'Cause I see the storm is getting closer 
 And the waves, they get so high 
 Seems everything we've ever known's here 
 Why must it drift away and die 
 I'll never find any light to replace you 
 Guess I'll have to make it through this time 
 Oh, this time 
 Without you 
 I knew the storm was getting closer 
 And all my friends said I was high 
 But everything we've ever known's here 
 I never wanted it to dieI'm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth 
 And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out 
 Standin' on the corner 
 Callin' you names 
 With my juvenile skills and juvenile games 
 I'm a fast motherfucker 
 Tell you 'bout it sucker 
 Fuck with me and I'll fuck your mother 
 Your sister too 
 Your best girlfriend 
 Line 'em up 
 Put 'em end to end 
 I stick it in, pull it out 
 Then I grab your face 
 And cum in your mouth 
 Said, it tastes good, don't it? 
 Said, it tastes good, and you know it 
 Said, it tastes good, don't it? 
 Said, it tastes good, and you know it 
 If you're lookin' for trouble 
 I'm the one 
 If you're lookin' for a fight 
 Then we'll have some fun 
 Stupid motherfuckers shouldn't have ragged on me 
 They can't see what I can see 
 I've been up 
 I've been down 
 Kickin' shit all over this town 
 What they say means nothin' to me 
 Sweet, sweet taste of victory 
 I said it tastes good, don't it? 
 I said it tastes good, and you know it 
 God dammit, God dammit, said it tastes good, don't it? 
 It tastes good, and you know it 
 Take it away, Slash 
 Oh yeah! 
 I said it tastes good, don't it? 
 I said it tastes good, and you know it 
 I said it tastes good, don't it? 
 I said it tastes good, and you know it 
 I said it tastes good, don't it?

 I said it tastes good, and you know it 
 I said it tastes good, don't it?

 I said it tastes good, motherfucker you know it 
 I said it tastes good, don't it?

 Loves horses and her boyfriend too

 And dad has to hide

 And punched me in the nose 
 He said:

 If my intentions, 
 Are misunderstood, 
 Please be kind, 
 I've done, 
 All I should... 
 I won't ask, 
 Of you, 
 What I would, 
 Not do 
 Oh, I saw the damage in you, 
 My fortune had won the ending you 
 Why would they tell me to please don't just laugh, in my face 
 When all of the reasons they taugh us fall over themselves 
 To give way 
 Ah, yeah... 
 It's not a question whether my heart is true, 
 Streamed line 
 I had to pull through, 
 Look for a new beginning, 
 On you, 
 Whoa, I got a message for you, 
 Open a way, it's what I've got to do... 
 Give what you have, for what you might lose 
 What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame 
 And what would you do if I had to deny, your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away? 
 Ooh, yeah, 
 Who should I tell if not for the ones, 
 That you could not save, 
 Ooh, now, 
 I told you when I found you 
 If there was doubts you 
 Should be careful and unafraid 
 Now they surround you 
 All that amounts to 
 Is love that you've crippled for fortune and fame! 
 If my affections 
 Are misunderstood 
 And you, decide, 
 I'm up, to no good 
 Don't ask, me to 
 Enjoy them, just for you 
 Ask yourself, 
 What I would do 
 To prostitute, myself, 
 To live with fortune and shame 
 Ooh, yeah, 
 When you should have turned to the hearts of the ones 
 That you would not save, 
 Ooh, now, 
 I told you 
 When I found you 
 All that amounts to 
 Is love that you've crippled for fortune and fame!I'm reckless and feelin' no pain 
 You know I've got no need to control 
 Livin' with the danger 
 I'm always on the edge now 
 With million dollar visions that I hold 
 Livin' like this never ever 
 Tore my life apart 
 I know how to maintain 
 And you know I know my part 
 On a holiday, a permanent vacation 
 I'm living on a cigarette with wine 
 I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself 
 Yes, I imitate myself all of the time 
 Livin' like this never ever 
 Tore my life apart 
 I know how to maintain 
 'Cause it's comin' from my heart 
 I lead a reckless life 
 And I don't need your advice 
 I lead a reckless life 
 And you know it's my only vice 
 Reckless life 
 I lead a reckless life 
 I lead a reckless life 
 And you know it's my only... 
 Reckless life 
 I lead a reckless life

 And you know it's my only... 
 Hey, hey - yeah!I never meant to cause you any sorrow 
 I never meant to cause you any pain 
 I only wanted to one time see you laughing 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain 
 I never wanted to be your weekend lover 
 I only wanted to be some kind of friend 
 I could never steal you from another 
 It's such a shame our friendship had to end 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain 
 Honey I know, I know times are changing 
 It's time we all reach out for something new 
 That means you too 
 You say you want a leader 
 But you can't seem to make up your mind 
 I think you better close it 
 And let me guide you to the purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 Purple rain, Purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rainNo one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better. 
 No one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better. 
 The hardest part this troubled heart, 
 Has never yet been through now. 
 Was heal the scars that got their start, 
 Inside someone like you now. 
 For had I known or I'd been shown, 
 Back when how long it'd take me. 
 To break the charms that brought me harm, 
 And all but would erase me. 
 I never would or thought I could, 
 No matter what you'd pay me. 
 Replay the part, you stole my heart, 
 I should have known you're crazy. 
 If all I knew was that with you, 
 I'd want someone to save me. 
 It'd be enough, but just my luck, 
 I fell in love and maybe. 
 All that I wanted was, 
 Now I know you better. 
 You know I know better. 
 Now I know you better. 
 So bittersweet, this tragedy, 
 Won't ask for absolution. 
 This melody, inside of me, 
 Still searches for solution. 
 A twist of fate, a change of heart, 
 Cures my infatuation. 
 Of a broken heart, provides the spark, 
 For my determination. 
 No one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better. 
 No one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better. 
 All that I wanted was, 
 Now I know you better. 
 You know I know better. 
 Now I know you better. 
 I never wanted you to be so full of anger. 
 I never wanted you to be somebody else. 
 I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves. 
 I only wanted you to see things for yourself. 
 All that I wanted was, 
 Now I know you better. 
 Now we all know better. 
 All that I wanted was. 
 No, no, no, no, 
 No, no, no, no. 
 No, no, no, no, 
 No, no, no, no. 
 If I were you I'd manage to, 
 Avoid the invitation. 
 Of promised love that can't keep up, 
 With your adoration. 
 Just use your head and in the end, 
 You'll find your inspiration. 
 To choose your steps and won't regret, 
 This kind of aggravation. 
 No one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better. 
 No one ever told me when I was alone, 
 They just thought I'd know better, better.Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy. 
 Bring it back home to me. 
 Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him. 
 Bring it back home to me. 
 When? Why wonder? 
 Brown-eyed stunner, come on, 
 Bring it home to me. 
 Kiss a little, fishing for your lover, 
 Won't you bring it down home to me. 
 See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog in here. 
 She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree. 
 See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin 
 Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her thing. 
 You can see the love, like check an ounce for pain, 
 Darling won't you wanna; 
 Sorry to resent, you said; gimme back, 
 Keep your teeth 
 Never wanna hold you, 
 Never wanna kiss you, 
 I bet she's taking away from me. 
 Never will repeat it, or never reprimand it, 
 Will you bring it back home to me. 
 Take care before my baby, 
 When your baby gives it up for free. 
 She just puts around, being lazy, 
 But since she brings her lover to me. 
 Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury. 
 Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it. 
 I'll tell you just how it's gonna be. 
 I call your lover in the morning, 
 When you have your cup of tea. 
 You never give me your warning, 
 So you better give her right up for me. 
 Guess who's coming over, on your thinks; 
 That's such a surprise. 
 If you're saying you never known her, 
 Honey, you better open your eyes. 
 Look out. 
 See a real long fire, she's the dog in here. 
 She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree. 
 See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin. 
 Break a back for her daddy, when she does her thing. 
 Can't take care before my baby, 
 When your baby gives it up for free. 
 She just gets around being lazy, 
 Until she brings her loving to me. 
 I don't need nothing to save me, 
 Say for a piece of your luxury. 
 Lock the door, but you'll never gage me. 
 I tell you just how it's gonna be. 
 I call your lover in the morning, 
 When you have your cup of tea. 
 You never give me a warning, 
 So get yourself a letter from me. 
 Oh, where're you going, tell me; who're you to see? 
 I've been sleeping on your doorstep, 
 Baby, won't you bring it back home to me. 
 Get me something for my jealous mind, 
 You don't get something for free. 
 You just bring it down home to me. 
 Ha-Ha-HaHey this bottle's empty, you got 2 bucks? 
 C'mon, we'll buy a bottle 
 Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes 
 Hot damn 
 Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah 
 I push on the peddle but you know I go too far 
 There're parties everywhere that I can see 
 Usin' myself will be the death of me 
 Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone 
 My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home 
 But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun 
 With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right 
 I know that I need just more than one 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my room 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my room 
 Let's go 
 When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends 
 Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast 
 With friends like that tell me who's gonna last 
 Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not 
 I want everything that everybody's got 
 Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand 
 Just give me one more, one last dance 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my room 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my room 
 Let's go 
 Take the car, take the keys 
 Said my money don't grow on trees 
 You make me stumble and fall 
 'Til I'm bloody at my knees 
 I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone 
 Too much too soon not know since it's been so long 
 You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind 
 Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind 
 There's another girl that's waitin' down the road 
 When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my room 
 Said it's too much too fast 
 I don't care if I won't last 
 Said it's too much too soon 
 I don't care, get outta my roomWhen you were young and your heart was an open book 
 You used to say live and let live 
 (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did) 
 But if this ever changin' world in which we live in 
 Makes you give in and cry 
 Say live and let die 
 Live and let die 
 What does it matter to ya? 
 When ya got a job to do, ya got to do it well 
 You got to give the other fella hell 
 You used to say live and let live 
 (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did) 
 But if this ever changin' world in which we live in 
 Makes you give in and cry 
 Say live and let die

 My way, your way, anything goes tonight 
 My way, your way, anything goes to- 
 Ooh, panties 'round your knees with your ass in the breeze 
 Doin' that grind with a push and squeeze 
 Tied up, tied down, up against the wall 
 Be my Rubbermaid baby and we can do it all 
 My way, your way, anything goes tonight 
 My way, your way, anything goes tonight, yeah

 And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out 
 'Cause I'll be standin' on the corner, callin' you names 
 With my juvenile skills and delinquent games 
 'Cause I'm a fast motherfucker 
 Let me tell you 'bout it sucker 
 If you fuck with me, I'll fuck your mother 
 Your sister too, and your best girlfriend 
 I'll line 'em up, and put 'em end to end 
 And then I'll put out, stick it in, I'll pull it out 
 I'll grab your face and cum in your mouth 
 It tastes good, don't it? 
 It tastes good, and you know it 
 It tastes good, don't it?

 If you're looking for trouble, I'm the one 
 If you're looking for a fight go have some fun 
 Ya like to dance, ya like to sing 
 I'm the one and we'll get it on 
 Ya wanna dance?We all come in from the cold 
 We come down from the wire 
 And everybody warms themselves 
 To a different fire 
 When sometimes we get burned 
 You'd think sometime we'd learn 
 The one you love is the one 
 That should take you higher 
 You ain't got no one 
 You better go back out and find her 
 Just like children hidin' in a closet 
 Can't tell what's goin' on outside 
 Sometimes we're so far off the beaten path 
 We get taken for a ride 
 By a parlor trick or some words of wit 
 A hidden hand up a sleeve 
 To think that thee one you love could hurt you now 
 Is a little hard to believe 
 But everybody, darlin' 
 Sometimes bites the hand that feeds 
 When I look around 
 Everybody always brings me down 
 Well is it them or me 
 Well I just can't see 
 But there ain't no peace to found 
 But if someone really cared 
 Well, they'd take the time to spare 
 A moment to try and understand 
 Another one's despair 
 Remember in this game we call life 
 That no one said it's fair 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Breakdown 
 (let me hear it now) 
 Breakdown 
 (let me hear it now, yeah) 
 Breakdown 
 (let me hear it now) 
 Get down with yo' bad self, alright 
 I've come to know the cold 
 I think of it as home 
 When there ain't enough of me to go around 
 I'd rather be left alone 
 But if I call you out of habit 
 I'm out of love and I gotta have it 
 Would you give it to me if I fit you needs 
 Like when we both knew we had it 
 But now the damage's done 
 And we're back out on the run 
 Funny how everything was roses 
 When we held on to the guns 
 Just because you're winnin' 
 Don't mean you're the lucky ones 
 Breakdown 
 (let me hear it now) 
 Breakdown 
 (yeah) 
 Breakdown 
 Breakdown 
 (let me hear it now) 
 Hay yay 
 There goes the challenger 
 Being chased by the blue blue meanies on wheels 
 The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver 
 The last American hero 
 The-the electric sintar 
 The demi-god 
 The super driver of the golden west 
 Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver 
 The police numbers are getting closer-closer 
 Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile, yeah baby 
 They about to strike, they gonna get him, SMASH ! RAPE ! 
 The last beautiful free soul on this planet 
 But, it is written 
 If the Evil Spirit arms the Tiger with claws 
 Brahman provided wings for the Dove 
 Thus spake the Super Guru 
 "Did you hear that"Mama, take this badge from me 
 I can't use it anymore 
 It's getting dark, too dark to see 
 Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey hey yeah 
 Mama, put my guns in the ground 
 I can't shoot them anymore 
 That cold black cloud is comin' down 
 Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door 
 Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah

 Try to find a boy who's going to be what I ain't 
 And what you need is a plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint 
 Who's going to sit through all the madness always act so quaint 
 I said - a, oh yeah, well - a. 
 It's your new friend, you're really 
 Making a scene, and I've seen you 
 Bouncing around, from machine to machine

 Generate some warmth, then you'll 
 See just what I mean, oh baby, baby, baby yeah.

 Drag of that cigarette, why don't you

 Million dollar bet, because you're 
 Liable to lose it on a 
 Best loving you've had yet, oh baby baby, oh yeah

 It's like I'm talking 'bout the human race 
 You're trying to cover up a big disgrace 
 Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 Well I may think that this whole scene is just a 
 Too appalling for me 
 Well, I may be the type who's just mad about 
 Every little thing that I see, but I can 
 Colour that with history, and make it 
 Just what I want it to be, well I'm 
 Blowing my change on the fan magazines, with all the 
 Hollywood refugees, oh baby, baby, oh yeah 
 Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause 
 I'm a human being, and if I 
 Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause 
 I'm a human being 
 And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause

 Yeah, baby"What we've got here is failure to communicate. 
 Some men you just can't reach. 
 So, you get what we had here last week, 
 which is the way he wants it. 
 Well, he gets it.  I don't like it 
 any more than you men." 
 Look at your young men fighting 
 Look at your women crying 
 Look at your young men dying 
 The way they've always done before 
 Look at the hate we're breeding 
 Look at the fear we're feeding 
 Look at the lives we're leading 
 The way we've always done before 
 My hands are tied 
 The billions shift from side to side 
 And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
 For the love of God and our human rights 
 And all these things are swept aside 
 By bloody hands time can't deny 
 And are washed away by your genocide 
 And history hides the lies of our civil war 
 Did you wear a black armband 
 When they shot the man 
 Who said, 
 "Peace could last forever" 
 And in my first memories 
 They shot Kennedy 
 I went numb when I learned to see 
 So I never fell for Vietnam 
 We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all 
 That you can't trust freedom 
 When it's not in your hands 
 When everybody's fightin' 
 For their promised land and 
 I don't need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Ain't that fresh 
 I don't need your civil war 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 Look at the shoes you're filling 
 Look at the blood we're spilling 
 Look at the world we're killing 
 The way we've always done before 
 Look in the doubt we've wallowed 
 Look at the leaders we've followed 
 Look at the lies we've swallowed 
 And I don't want to hear no more 
 My hands are tied 
 For all I've seen has changed my mind 
 But still the wars go on as the years go by 
 With no love of God or human rights 
 'Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
 By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
 Who carry the cross of homicide 
 And history bears the scars of our civil war 
 "We practice selective annihilation 
 Of mayors and government officials, 
 for example, to create a vacuum. 
 Then we fill that vacuum. 
 As popular war advances 
 Peace is closer." 
 I don't need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Ain't that fresh 
 And I don't need your civil war 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 I don't need your civil war 
 I don't need your civil war 
 Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Ain't that fresh 
 I don't need your civil war 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 I don't need one more war 
 I don't need one more war 
 No, no, no 
 What's so civil 'bout war anyway?All I need is some inspiration 
 Before I do somebody some harm 
 I feel just like a vegetable 
 Down here on the farm 
 Nobody comes to see me 
 Nobody here to turn me on 
 I ain't even got a lover 
 Down here on the farm 
 They told me to get healthy 
 They told me to get some sun 
 But boredom eats me like cancer 
 Down here on the farm 
 Drinking lemonade shandy 
 Ain't nobody here to do me harm 
 But I'm like a fish out of water 
 Down here on the farm 
 I write a thousand letters 
 Till my fingers all gone numb 
 But I never see no postman 
 Down here on the farm 
 I call my baby on the telephone 
 I say come down and have some fun 
 But she knows what the score is 
 Down here on the farm 
 I can't fall in love with a wheatfield 
 I can't fall in love with a barn 
 Well everything smells like horse shit 
 Down here on the farm 
 Blue skies and swimming pools 
 Add so much charm 
 But I'd rather be back in Soho 
 Down here on the farm 
 On the fucking farm! 
 Are you born in a fucking barn or what? 
 Baaaaa! 
 Hold stillYou better change your attitude 
 Cause you know you want it to 
 You bring me all your pride 
 But I know you hold it too 
 I can feed your bounty, yeah 
 If you feed my head as well 
 And I won't give you empty promises, yeah 
 When the quarter's in the wishing well 
 But this ain't no sentimental movie 
 Where dreams collect like dust 
 You talk to me with innocence in your eyes 
 So now, who can you trust? 
 You think you look so cool 
 Yes you do 
 You take me for your fool, yeah 
 Itching' for your... of the hug 
 Baby I want a new start, but don't you be true, yeah 
 I can see through your door 
 You put my head into these walls 
 You take my heart to the dockside, yeah 
 You put me in the car 
 And take me for another ride 
 But this ain't no sentimental movie 
 Where dreams collect like dust 
 You talk to me with innocence in your eyes 
 So now, who can you trust? 
 Trust 
 Trust 
 Put a path on to your veins 
 And antique and old whore's our new pain, yeah 
 The tears you cried 
 All the tears you cried tonight 
 Yeah 
 You put me down 
 But you can't get out of sight 
 And this ain't no sentimental movie 
 You push it on 
 You grab it on 
 But I don't see the TV 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 Yeah, see the screen 
 You're startin' to scream 
 Abusin' confusin' 
 Your program's over 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 Yeah, you look so cool 
 Don't take me for another one of your scenes 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 The tears you cried 
 All the tears you cried tonight 
 Yeah 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 This ain't no sentimental movie 
 YeaSeems like forever and a day 
 If my intentions are misunderstood 
 Please be kind, I've done all I should 
 I won't ask of you what I would not do 
 Oh, I saw the damage in you 
 My fortunate one 
 The envy of youth 
 Why would they tell me to please those 
 That laugh in my face 
 When all of the reasons they've taught us 
 Fall over themselves to give way 
 Its not a question whether my heart is true 
 Streamlined, I had to pull through 
 Look for a new beginning on you 
 Oh, I got a message for you 
 Up and away 
 It's what I gotta do 
 Forgive what you have 
 For what you might lose 
 What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame 
 And what would you do if I had to deny your name 
 Where would you go if I told you I love you 
 And then walked away 
 N' who would I turn to if not for the ones 
 You could not say 
 I told you when I found you 
 If there were doubts you 
 Should be careful and unafraid 
 Now they surround you 
 And all that amounts to 
 Is love that you fed by 
 Perversion and pain 
 So if my affections are misunderstood 
 And you decide I'm up to no good 
 Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you 
 Ask yourself 
 Why I would choose 
 To prostitute myself 
 To live with fortune and shame, oh yeah 
 When you should have turned to the hearts of the ones 
 That you could not save 
 I told you when I found you 
 All that amounts to 
 Is love that you fed by 
 Perversion and painI've been lookin' for a trace 
 Lookin' for a heart 
 Lookin' for a lover in a world 
 That's much too dark 
 You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction 
 (Ooh yeah) 
 You don't need my love 
 You've got to find yourself 
 Another piece of the action, yeah 
 Say where you goin'? 
 What you gonna do? 
 I've been lookin' everywhere 
 I've been lookin' for you 
 You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction 
 (I've got your satisfaction) 
 You don't need my love 
 You've got to find yourself 
 Another piece of the action 
 'Cause your crazy 
 (Crazy) 
 You're fuckin' crazy 
 (Oh my) 
 You know you're crazy 
 (Oh child) 
 I said you're crazy 
 Say boy where ya coming from? 
 Where'd you get that point of view? 
 When I was younger 
 Said I knew someone like you and they said 
 You don't want my love 
 You want satisfaction 
 (Yeah) 
 You don't need my love 
 You've gotta find yourself 
 Another piece of the action 
 'Cause you're crazy 
 (Crazy) 
 You're fuckin' crazy 
 (Oh my) 
 You know you're crazy 
 (Oh child) 
 I said you're crazy 
 Ooh, you're crazy 
 You know you're crazy 
 Ooh yeah, you're crazy 
 You know you're crazy 
 You know you are 
 Bring it down 
 You're fuckin' crazyIt was long ago, 
 Seems like a dream. 
 The day I sucked the air 
 From a bottle of whipped cream 
 And I got real high 
 And things got real slow 
 And I started talking like this 
 What's going on? 
 I don't know 
 And then I sold my car 
 For a Greatful Dead ticket 
 My dad yelled at me 
 And he grounded me 
 And he said I was a dick, 
 It was the worst day of my life 
 And I'll never forget 
 But the very next day 
 I was doing bong hits 
 In the back of my friend's chevy 
 So don't tell me 
 We're winning the war on drugs 
 Cause drugs are like a big ol' can of raid 
 And you're all little bugs 
 And don't tell me 
 To not get high 
 'Cause I'm as low as I can get 
 Without kissing your ass 
 And blowing you at the same time 
 Man, don't tell me about love and peace 
 When one of the Joneses have a handgun 
 Pointed at me 
 Don't tell me to just say no 
 I'm an addict, I say don't let me go 
 Whatever happened to sex drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll? 
 Now we just have AIDS crack and techno 
 So they busted me 
 So I say "fuck them up" 
 For selling dope 
 And I went to jail 
 And I wasn't forgiven 
 Like that little fucker who shot the pope 
 And he said I had the right to remain silent 
 And they couldn't explain 
 But I didn't resist 
 And I was invited 
 'Cause all I ever wanted was the right to remain 
 And they questioned me 
 Yeah, they asked me "why?" 
 And I said "fuck off" 
 I don't think I should be shot 
 For selling pot 
 It's just my little way of saying "high" 
 Now my record's all fucked up 
 Now two times a week 
 They make me piss in a cup 
 Well what I want to do 
 Is piss down their throats 
 Okay, here's the sensitive part 
 They told me 
 That times have changed 
 Cause our parents had 
 Hendrix, Janice and Jim 
 But what about 
 River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain 
 And they told me 
 To praise the lord 
 But I've been waiting for so long 
 For him to call me back 
 I think I'm gonna go pray 
 At Betty Ford 
 And they told me 
 That life was fair 
 I can't smoke a plant that was made by God 
 But I can kill my wife if I'm a football player 
 And they told me, 
 They told me to just ignore 
 But I'd rather smoke crack 
 Outta Nancy Reagan's skull 
 While gettin' a blowjob 
 From Tipper GoreOne, two 
 One, two, three, four 
 Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile 
 Girl, I think about you everyday now 
 Was a time when I wasn't sure but you, set my mind at ease 
 There is no doubt you're in my heart now 
 Said woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine 
 All we need is, just a little patience 
 Said sugar, make it slow, and we'll come together fine 
 All we need is just a little patience 
 ( 
 Patience 
 ) Mmm, yeah 
 I sit here on the stairs, 'cause I'd, rather be alone 
 If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear 
 Sometimes, I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time 
 But you know love, there's one more thing to consider 
 Said woman, take it slow, and things will be just fine 
 You and I'll just, use a little patience 
 Said sugar, take the time, 'cause the lights are shining bright 
 You and I've got, what it takes to make it 
 We won't fake it 
 Oh, I'll never break it 
 'Cause I can't take it 
 A little patience, mm yeah, ooh yeah 
 Need a little patience, yeah 
 Just a little patience, yeah 
 Some more patience, yeah

 And if you beat them all up they'll die 
 Been like a walk in the park for myself 
 And now you're keepin' your own kind in hell 
 And if your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself 
 While they all reach out for your help 
 And I'm outta time.Rollin'? 
 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 
 I tried so hard just to get through to you 
 But your head's so far from the realness of truth 
 Was it just a come on in the dark 
 Wasn't meant to last long 
 I think you've worn your welcome, honey 
 I'll just see you along 
 As I sing you this song 
 Time can pass slowly, things always change 
 You day's been numbered and I've read your last page 
 You was just a temporary lover, honey 
 You ain't the first 
 Lots of others came before you, woman 
 Said, but you been the worst 
 Said, you been the worst 
 So goodbye to you girl 
 So long, farewell 
 I can't hear you cryin' 
 Your jivin's been hell 
 So look for me walkin' 
 Down your street at night 
 I'll be in with another 
 Deep down inside 
 Deep down inside 
 "To the bar. That was a take."I try and feel the sunshine 
 You bring the rain 
 You try and hold me down 
 With your complaints 
 You cry and moan and complain 
 You whine an tear 
 Up to my neck in sorrow 
 The touch you bring 
 You just don't step inside to 
 To 14 years 
 So hard to keep my own head 
 That's what I say and you know 
 I've been the beggar 
 I've played the thief 
 I was the dog 
 They all tried to beat 
 But it's been 14 years of silence 
 It's been 14 years of pain 
 It's been 14 years that are gone forever 
 And I'll never have again, well 
 Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
 That I'm to blame 
 Well they're all used-up has-beens 
 Out of the game 
 This time I'll have the last word 
 You hear what I say 
 I tried to see it your way 
 It won't work today 
 You just don't step inside to 
 14 years 
 So hard to keep my own head 
 That's what I say, you know 
 I've been the dealer 
 Hangin' on your street 
 I was the dog 
 They all tried to beat 
 But it's been 14 years of silence 
 It's been 14 years of pain 
 It's been 14 years that are gone forever 
 And I'll never have again, well 
 Bullshit and contemplation 
 Gossip's their trade 
 If they knew half the real truth 
 What would they say? 
 Well, I'm past the point of concern 
 It's time to play 
 These last four years of madness 
 Sure put me straight 
 Don't get back 14 years 
 In just one day 
 So hard to keep my own head 
 Just go away, you know 
 Just like a hooker she said 
 Nothin' for free 
 Oh, I tried to see it your way 
 I tried to see it your wayOoh yeah 
 Ooh yeah 
 How could she look so fine? 
 How could it be she might be mine? 
 How could she be so cool? 
 I've been taken for a fool 
 So many times, yeah 
 It's a story of a man 
 Works as hard as he can 
 Just to be a man who stands on his own 
 But the book always burns 
 As the story takes its turn 
 And leaves a broken man 
 How could she be so cool? 
 How could she be so fine? 
 I owe a favor to a friend 
 My friends they always come through for me, yeah 
 It's a story of a man 
 Works as hard as he can 
 Just to be a man who stands on his own 
 But the book always burns 
 As the story takes it turn 
 And leaves a broken man 
 If you could only live my life 
 You could see the difference you make to me 
 To me 
 I'd look right up at night 
 And all I'd see was darkness 
 Now I see the stars alright 
 I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
 When the lights went down in your house 
 Yeah, that made me happy 
 The sweat I make for you 
 Yeah, I think you know where that comes from 
 Guitar, come on 
 Yeah, well, I'd look right up at night 
 And all I'd see was darkness 
 Now I see the stars alright 
 I wanna reach right up and grab one for you 
 When the lights went down in your house 
 Yeah, that made me happy 
 The sweat I make for you 
 I think you know where that comes from 
 How could she look so good? 
 (So good) 
 How could she be so fine? 
 How could she be so cool? 
 How could it be she might be mine? 
 YeahI don't have plans and schemes, 
 And I don't have hopes and dreams. 
 I, I, I don't have anything, 
 Since I don't have you. 
 And I don't have fond desires, 
 And I don't have happy hours. 
 I don't have anything, 
 Since I don't have you. 
 Happiness and I guess 
 I never will again. 
 When you walked out on me, 
 In walked old misery, 
 And she's been here since then. 
 (Spoken) Yeah, we're fucked! 
 I don't have love to share, 
 And I don't have one who cares. 
 I don't have anything, 
 Since I don't have you. 
 You, you, you, oh, oh! 
 You, you, you, oh, oh! 
 You, you, you, oh, oh! 
 You, you, you, oh, oh! 
 You, you, you, oh yeah!Yeah! 
 Attitude 
 Some fucking attitude 
 I can't believe what you say to me 
 You got some attitude 
 Inside that fetal brain 
 There's got to be a whore 
 If you don't shut your mouth 
 You're going to feel the floor, yeah! 
 Attitude, what you've got 
 Some fucking attitude 
 Attitude is what you've got 
 Some fucking attitude 
 Yeah, all right 
 Inside that fetal brain 
 There's got to be a whore 
 If you don't shut your mouth 
 You're going to feel the motherfucking guitar! 
 Oh, attitude (Attitude) 
 Some fucking attitude (Attitude) 
 I can't believe what you say to me 
 You got some attitude 
 Oh, attitude 
 Some fucking attitude 
 I can't believe what you say to me 
 You got some attitude 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah!Been hidin' out and layin' low 
 It's nothing new to me 
 Well, you can always find a place to go 
 If you can keep your sanity 
 They break down the doors and they rape my rights but 
 They won't touch me 
 They scream and yell and fight all night 
 You can't tell me 
 I lose my head, I close my eyes 
 They won't touch me 
 'Cause I got somethin' 've been buildin' up inside 
 For so fuckin' long 
 They're out ta get me 
 They won't catch me 
 I'm fuckin' innocent 
 They won't break me 
 Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin' 
 Sometimes it's harder to leave 
 And ev'rytime you think you know just what you're doin' 
 That's when your troubles exceed 
 They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but 
 They won't touch me 
 They preach and yell and fight all night 
 You can't tell me 
 I lose my head, I close my eyes 
 They won't touch me 
 'Cause I got somethin' I've been buildin' up inside 
 I'm already gone 
 They're out ta get me 
 They won't catch me 
 'Cause I'm innocent 
 They won't break me 
 No, no 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 No, oh, no, no, no 
 Let me see you try 
 Some people got a chip on their shoulder 
 And some would say it was me 
 But I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me 
 So I'd be quick to disagree 
 They're out ta get me 
 They won't catch me 
 I'm fuckin' innocent 
 They won't break me 
 They're out ta get me 
 They won't catch me 
 'Cause I'm innocent 
 So you can suck me 
 Take that one to heartBroken glass and cigarettes 
 Writing on the wall 
 It was a bargain for the summer 
 And I thought I had it all 
 I was the one who gave you everything 
 The one who took the fall 
 You were the one who would do anything 
 One who can't recall 
 Where she was while she was sleeping 
 In another's women's bed 
 Or the doctors or the lawyers 
 Or the stranger that she met 
 If there's nothing that I can gain from this 
 Or anything at all 
 It'd be the knowledge that you gave me 
 When I thought I'd heard it all 
 It was a long time for you 
 It was a long time for me 
 It'd be a long time for anyone 
 But looks like it's meant to be 
 Social class and registers 
 Cocaine in the hall 
 All the way from California 
 On the way to your next call 
 To those non-negotiations 
 To simulate a call 
 For the betterment of evils 
 And your ways around the laws 
 That'd keep you up and sitting pretty 
 On a pedestal or bed 
 And now you're sleeping like an angel 
 Near the man who you gave head 
 If there's something I can make of this 
 Or anything at all 
 It'd be the devil hates a loser 
 And you thought you had it all 
 It was the wrong time for you 
 It was the wrong time for me 
 It was the wrong time for everyone 
 But it looks like I'm 'bout to see for myself 
 If I could go back in time to the place in my soul 
 There all alone 
 Lonely teardrops, ooh, are calling you 
 But I don't want to know it now 
 'Cause knowing you, it won't change a damn thing 
 But there was a time 
 Yeah, there was a time 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 And I don't wanna know it now 
 Yeah, there was a time 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 And I don't wanna know it now 
 I would do anything for you 
 There was a time 
 I would do anything for you 
 I would do anything for you 
 There was a time 
 There was a time 
 I would do anything for you, ooh 
 There was a time 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 And I don't wanna know it now 
 There was a time 
 (I was there for you) 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 Didn't want to know it all 
 And I don't wanna know it nowOn the road for forty days, 
 Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. 
 Sweet, sweet Connie -- doin' her act, 
 She had the whole show and that's a natural fact. 
 Up all night with Freddy King, 
 I got to tell you poker's his thing. 
 A-booze 'n' ladies keep me right, 
 As long as we can make it to the show tonight. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down. 
 We're an American band. 
 Four young chaquitas in Omaha, 
 Was waitin' for the band to return from the show. 
 Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night, 
 The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight. 
 Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan, 
 They was out to meet the boys in the band. 
 They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on," 
 And we proceeded to tear that hotel down. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down. 
 We're an American band. 
 We're an American Band, Ooh-ooh. 
 We're an American Band, Ooh-ooh. 
 We're an American Band, Ooh-ooh.Ah, when all is said and done 
 We're not the only ones 
 Who look at life this way 
 That's what the old folks say 
 But every time I see them 
 Makes me wish I had a gun 
 If I thought that I was crazy 
 Well I guess I'd have more fun 
 Guess I'd have more fun 
 Oooh, the catcher in the rye again 
 Won't let you get away from him 
 (Tomorrow never comes) 
 It's just another day like today 
 You decide, 'cause I don't have to 
 And then they'll find and I won't ask you 
 At anytime or long hereafter 
 If the cold outside's as I'm imagining it to be, oh 
 La na na na na na na 
 La na na na na na na 
 Oooh, the catcher in the rye again 
 Ooh, won't let you get away from him 
 (Tomorrow never comes) 
 It's just another day like today 
 When all is said and done 
 We're not the only ones 
 Who look at life this way 
 That's what the young folks say 
 As if they'd ever change 
 As that who lie to say 
 But every time I see them 
 Makes me wish I had a gun 
 If I thought that I was crazy 
 Well I guess I'd have more fun 
 'Cause what used to be's not there for me 
 And ought to for someone 
 That belongs insane, like I do 
 Lana nana na na na 
 Lana nana na nana 
 On an ordinary day 
 Not in an ordinary way 
 All at once the song I heard 
 No longer would it play 
 For anybody 
 Or anyone 
 That needed comfort from somebody 
 Needed comfort from someone 
 Who cared 
 To be 
 Not like you 
 And unlike me 
 And then the voices went away 
 From me 
 Somehow you set the wheels in motion 
 That haunt our memories 
 You were the instrument 
 You were the one 
 How a body took a body 
 You gave that boy a gun 
 You took our innocence 
 Behind our stares 
 Sometime the only thing 
 We counted on when no one else was there 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Na na, na na, na naFound a head and an arm in the garbage can 
 Don't know why I'm here 
 Livin' on the run for oh so long 
 I gotta go collect 
 Double talkin' jive 
 Get the money motherfucker 
 'Cause I got no more patience 
 Double talkin' (lies) 
 I got no more patience man 
 Back in town an'a all new friends 
 They sayin' how ya been? 
 Fucked up and outta place 
 That's how I felt back then 
 Double talkin' jive 
 Get the money motherfucker 
 'Cause I got no more patience 
 Double talkin' (lies) 
 I got no more patience man 
 You dig what I'm sayin'?Hey, you caught me in a coma 
 I don't think I wanna 
 Ever come back to this world again 
 Kinda like it in a coma 
 'Cause no one's ever gonna 
 Oh, make me come back to this world again 
 Now I feel as if I'm floating away 
 I can't feel all the pressure and I like it this way 
 But my body's callin' 
 My body's callin' 
 "Won't you come back to this world again" 
 Suspended deep in a sea of black 
 I've got the light at the end 
 I've got the bones on the mast 
 Well I've gone sailin' 
 I've gone sailin' 
 I could leave so easily 
 While friends are calling back to me 
 I said they're, they're leaving it all up to me 
 When all I needed was clarity and 
 Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on 
 Goddamn it 
 Slippin' farther an farther away 
 It's a miracle how long we can stay 
 In a world our minds created 
 In a world that's full of shit 
 Help me 
 Help me 
 Help me 
 Help me 
 Bastard 
 Please understand me 
 I'm climbing through the wreckage 
 Of all my twisted dreams 
 But this cheap investigation just 
 Can't stifle all my screams 
 And I'm waitin' at the crossroads 
 Waiting for you 
 Waiting for you 
 Where are you? 
 No one's gonna bother me anymore 
 No one's gonna mess with my head no more 
 I can't understand what all the fightin's for 
 But it's so nice here down off the shore 
 I wish you could see this 'cause there's nothing to see 
 It's peaceful here and it's fine with me 
 Not like the world where I used to live 
 I never really wanted to live 
 Ahh 
 Okay, we're starting to lose this guy... 
 Zap him again 
 Zap the son of a bitch again 
 Live your life like it's a coma 
 Won't you tell me why we'd wanna 
 With all the reasons you give it's 
 It's kinda hard to believe 
 But who am I to tell you 
 That I've seen any reason why you should stay 
 Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway 
 Got a one way ticket on your last chance ride 
 Gotta one way ticket to your suicide 
 Gotta one way ticket and there's no way out alive 
 And all this crass communication 
 That has left you in the cold 
 Isn't much for consolation 
 When you feel so weak and old 
 But if home is where the heart is 
 Then there's stories to be told 
 No, you don't need a doctor 
 No one else can heal your soul 
 Got your mind in submission 
 Got your life on the line 
 But nobody pulled the trigger 
 They just stepped aside 
 They be down by the water 
 While you watch 'em waving goodbye 
 They be callin' in the morning 
 They be hangin' on the phone 
 They be waiting for an answer 
 But you know nobody's home 
 And when the bell stopped ringing 
 It was nobody's fault but your own 
 There were always ample warnings 
 There were always subtle signs 
 And you would have seen it comin' 
 But we gave you too much time 
 And when you said that no one's listening 
 Why'd your best friend drop a dime 
 Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
 For a way to spend our time 
 And it's so easy to be social 
 It's so easy to be cool 
 Yeah, it's easy to be hungry 
 When you ain't got shit to lose 
 And I wish that I could help you 
 With what you hope to find 
 But I'm still out here waiting 
 Watching reruns of my life 
 When you reach the point of breaking 
 Know it's gonna take some time 
 To heal the broken memories 
 That another man would need just to surviveI won't be told anymore 
 That I've been brought down in this storm, ooh 
 And left so far out from the shore 
 That I can't find my way back, my way anymore 
 Oh no, I won't be told anymore 
 That I've been brought down in this storm 
 Ooh, and left so far out from the shore 
 Oh, that I can't find my way back, my way anymore 
 No, I, I, I 
 Forgive them that tear down my soul 
 Bless them that they might grow old 
 Oh, and free them so that they may know 
 That it's never too late 
 For the many times what seemed like a memory 
 I searched and found the way you used to lure me in 
 Oh, I found the ways to know why I had to be 
 Mired in denial and so afraid, oh 
 If we ever find this true 
 That we have the strength to choose 
 Oh, the freedom or the chains 
 We held together

 Lets drink to the lowly of birth. 
 Raise your glass to the good and the evil, 
 Lets drink to the salt of the earth. 
 Say a prayer for the common foot soldier, 
 Spare a thought for his back breaking work. 
 Say a prayer for his wife and his children, 
 Who burn the fires and who still till the earth. 
 And when I search a faceless crowd, 
 A swirling mass of gray and black and white. 
 They don't look real to me, 
 In fact, they look so strange. 
 Raise your glass to the hard working people, 
 Lets drink to the uncounted heads. 
 Lets think of the wandering millions, 
 Who need leaders but get gamblers instead. 
 Spare a thought for the stay at home voter, 
 His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows. 
 And a parade of the gray suited grafters, 
 A choice of cancer or polio. 
 And when I search a faceless crowd, 
 A swirling mass of gray and black and white. 
 They don't look real to me, 
 In fact, they look so strange. 
 Lets drink to the hard working people, 
 Lets think of the lowly of birth. 
 Spare a thought for the rag taggy people, 
 Sets drink to the salt of the earth. 
 Lets drink to the hard working people, 
 Lets drink to the salt of the earth. 
 Lets think of the two thousand million, 
 Lets think of the humble of birthThis one's for you, Johnny 
 It doesn't pay to try 
 All the smart boys know why 
 It doesn't mean I didn't try 
 I just never know why 
 It isn't 'cause I'm all alone 
 Oh, baby, you're not home 
 And when I'm home 
 Big deal, I'm still alone 
 It's so restless as I am 
 Beat my head against a pole 
 Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones 
 And even though I don't show 
 Those guys are so old 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Don't try 
 Don't try 
 You're just a bastard kid 
 And you got no name 
 Could you live with me? 
 Go on and say 
 And even though it don't show 
 Those guys are so old 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Can't put your arms around a memory 
 Don't try 
 Don't try 
 Johnny, you're me 
 Yeah, your memory 
 I want to put my arms around your memory 
 I can't try... 
 I can't try 
 Don't try 
 Come on 
 L.A.M.F. 
 Like a motherfucker 
 Yo Johnny 
 What color were her eyes? 
 Oh, she was wearing shades? 
 Fuck itYesterday 
 There was so many things I was never told 
 Now that I'm startin' to learn 
 I feel I'm growing old 
 'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Old pictures that I'll always see 
 Time just fades the pages 
 In my book of memories 
 Prayers in my pocket 
 And no hand in destiny 
 I'll keep on movin' along 
 With no time to plant my feet 
 'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Old pictures that I'll always see 
 Some things could be better 
 If we'd all just let them be 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Got nothin' for me 
 Yesterday 
 There was so many things I was never shown 
 Suddenly this time I found 
 I'm on the streets and I'm all alone 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Old pictures that I'll always see 
 I ain't got time 
 To reminisce old novelties 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Yesterday's got nothin' for me 
 Yesterday 
 YesterdayIf the world would end today 
 And all the dreams we've had would all just drift away, ooh 
 You know there's nothing more to say 
 If the world would end and our love slip away, ooh 
 I never knew the way that you look at me 
 Would ever mean so much to me 
 But in my heart I found the feelin's that I've never shown 
 And now they've got the best of me 
 If the world would end today 
 And all the dreams we've had would all just drift away, ooh 
 You know there's nothing more to say 
 If the world would end and our love slip away, ooh 
 Oooh 
 La la da da, la da da da da da 
 La la da da, la da da da da da 
 I never thought all the love I was lookin' for 
 Could ever be so close to me 
 But you're the only one I have ever loved that has ever loved me 
 And now you've got the best of me 
 If the world would end today 
 And all the dreams we had would all just slip away, ooh 
 You know there's nothing more to say 
 If the world would end today 
 And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh 
 You know there's nothing more to say 
 If the world would end and our love slipped away 
 If the world would end and our love slipped awayMy heart is full of love for you 
 I wanna get right next to you

 Riad N' The Bedouins 
 Had a plan and thought they'd win 
 But I don't give a fuck 'bout them 
 'Cause I am crazy 
 Oh, my salvation 
 All my frustrations 
 Caught in the lies no one had wove as well 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh 
 Ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Riad N' The Bedouins 
 Say that's a war that you can't win 
 But I have had enough of them 
 And who can blame me 
 Sent down on desert winds 
 Nomads and barbarians 
 I won't bend my will to them 
 You aggravate me 
 Oh, my salvation 
 And all my frustrations 
 Caught in the lies no one had wove as well 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell 
 Oh, my salvation 
 And all my frustrations 
 Caught in the lies no one had wove as well 
 Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh 
 Ah, ah, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah

 Riad N' The Bedouins 
 Had a plan and though they'd win 
 Riad N' The Bedouins 
 Crossed the line and lost againWanna tell you a story 
 'Bout a woman I know 
 When it comes to lovin' 
 Oh she steals the show 
 She ain't exactly pretty 
 Ain't exactly small 
 Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six 
 You could say she's got it all 
 Never had a woman 
 Never had a woman like you 
 Doing all the things 
 Doing all the things you do 
 Ain't no fairy story 
 Ain't no skin and bone 
 But you give it all you got 
 Weighing in at nineteen stone 
 You're a whole lotta woman 
 A whole lotta woman 
 Whole lotta Rosie 
 And you're a whole lotta woman 
 Oh honey you can do it 
 Do it to me all night long 
 Only one to turn 
 Only one to turn me on 
 All through the night time 
 And right around the clock 
 To my surprise 
 Rosie never stopsI know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our lives 
 But I've been screaming in my bed late at night 
 A space a little, little and your stack of pain 
 Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay 
 You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
 I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
 There's something I need to say before it's to late 
 But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay 
 Just another Sunday 
 Just another Sunday 
 Oh yaaa, just another Sunday 
 Just another Sunday, oh yaaa 
 There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face 
 That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid 
 Don't think your second chance will break around the bend 
 'Cause hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other 
 End 
 You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
 I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
 There's something I need to say before it's to late 
 But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya 
 Just another Sunday yaa 
 Just another Sunday oh baby 
 It's only one more Sunday 
 Just another Sunday, oh yaaa 
 Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me 
 'Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery 
 Take a walk away won't end the carousel 
 But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well 
 You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
 I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
 There's something I need to say before it's to late 
 But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay 
 Just another Sunday yaa 
 Just another Sunday oh baby 
 It's only one more Sunday 
 Just another Sunday 
 It's just another Sunday 
 It's just another

 I've got a funny feeling and it won't go away 
 I've got an itchy finger and there'll be hell to pay 
 I'm gonna pull the trigger and blow them all away 
 Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me 
 Don't ever try to tell me how you are there for me 
 I don't believe there's a reason 
 (I don't believe it) 
 I don't believe there's a reason 
 (I don't believe it) 
 I've got a wicked demon, his hunger never fades 
 I've got an empty feeling I won't be home today

 (I don't believe it)Crash diet of reds'n'ludes 
 A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze 
 Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose 
 In your one track mind now 
 Where's that leave you? 
 Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby 
 Takin' your last ride 
 Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time 
 Sorry you took mother's car now 
 Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go 
 You bet one too many, now one for the road 
 Fresh outta detox, fresh from jail 
 Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell 
 Drink'n'drive white lightning faster 
 Takin' your last ride 
 Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
 Sorry you took mother's car now 
 Too soon, you thought ... 
 Too late for the pressure and strain 
 Too bad for those who don't believe it 
 Ruby street still calls your name 
 Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive 
 Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive 
 With no control in your life ahead 
 You're never gonna see if you wind up dead 
 Drink'n'drive white lightning faster 
 Takin' your last ride 
 Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
 Drink'n'drive white lightning baby 
 It's always on your mind 
 Push or pull your limits baby, do it one more time 
 Break it down 
 Break it down 
 Somethin 
 s changin', somethin 
 s breakin' 
 You gotta be a brother, 'cause ?! your family 
 ?!... Oh make it 
 Sweet mystery, Ooh 
 If you don't care about yourself 
 Would you please leave me alive 
 Ooh... 
 You gonna 
 You gonna drink'n'drive 
 Ooh, Yeah!You wanna step into my world 
 It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss 
 You've been delayed in the real world 
 How many times have you hit and missed? 
 You cat-scan shows disfiguration 
 I wanna laugh myself to death 
 With a misfired synapse with a bent configuration 
 I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath 
 You wanna talk to me? So talk to me 
 You wanna talk to me? So talk to me 
 You wanna talk to me? So talk to me 
 You wanna talk to me? So talk to me 
 You don't understand your sex 
 You ain't been mindfucked yet 
 Let's do it 
 Let's do it 
 Let's do it 
 (Oh, my distorted smile) 
 Guess what I'm doing nowI'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn 
 And I'll rip your heart in two 
 And I'll leave you lying on the bed 
 I'll be out the door before you wake 
 It's nothing new to you 
 'Cause I think we've seen that movie too 
 'Cause you could be mine 
 But you're way out of line 
 With your bitch slap rapping 
 And your cocaine tongue 
 You get nothing done 
 I said you could be mine 
 Now holidays come and then they go 
 It's nothing new today 
 Collect another memory 
 When I come home late at night 
 Don't ask me where I've been 
 Just count your stars I'm home again 
 'Cause you could be mine 
 But you're way out of line 
 With your bitch slap rapping 
 And your cocaine tongue 
 You get nothing done 
 I said you could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine, mine, mine, mine 
 You've gone sketching too many times 
 Ooh, why don't you give it a rest? 
 Why must you find 
 Another reason to cry? 
 While you're breaking down my back and I've been racking out my brain 
 It don't matter how we make it 'cause it always ends the same 
 You can push it for more mileage but your flaps are wearing thin 
 And I could sleep on it till morning but this nightmare never ends 
 Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands 
 And you can take the pity so far but it's more than I can stand 
 'Cause this couch trip's getting older, tell me how long has it been 
 'Cause five years is forever and you haven't grown up yet 
 You could be mine 
 But you're way out of line 
 With your bitch slap rapping 
 And your cocaine tongue 
 You get nothing done 
 I said you could be 
 You should be 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 Oh, you could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 Oh, you could be mine 
 Oh, you could be mine 
 Oh, you could be mine 
 You could be mine 
 YeahYour daddy works in porno 
 Now that mommy's not around 
 She used to love her heroin 
 But now she's underground 
 So you stay out late at night 
 And you do your coke for free 
 Drivin' your friends crazy 
 With your life's insanity 
 Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
 Well, well, well, my Michelle 
 Look out 
 Sowin' all your wild oats 
 In another's luxuries 
 Yesterday was Tuesday 
 Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
 But school starts much too early 
 And this hotel wasn't free 
 So party till your connection calls 
 Honey, I'll return the key 
 Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
 Well, well, well, my Michelle 
 Well, well, well, you never can tell 
 Well, well, well, my Michelle 
 Everyone needs love 
 You know that it's true 
 Someday you'll find someone 
 That'll fall in love with you 
 But oh the time it takes 
 When you're all alone 
 Someday you'll find someone 
 That you can call your own 
 But till then you better 
 Now you're clean and so discreet 
 I won't say a word 
 But most of all this song is true 
 Case you haven't heard 
 So c'mon and stop your cryin' 
 We both know money burns 
 Honey don't stop tryin' 
 And you'll get what you deserve 
 Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
 Well, well, well, my Michelle 
 Well, well, well, you never can tell 
 Well, well, well, my Michelle 
 My, my, my Michelle 
 My, my, my Michelle 
 Ooh, my, my, my Michelle 
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my Michelle

 He lost his mind today 
 He left it out back on the highway 
 On "65" 
 She loved him yesterday 
 Yesterday's over 
 I said okay 
 That's all right 
 Time moves on 
 That's the way 
 We live an hope to see the next day 
 That's all right 
 Sometimes these things they are so easy 
 Sometimes these things they are so cold 
 Sometimes these things just seem to 
 Rip you right in two 
 Oh no man don't let 'em get ta you 
 She loved him yesterday 
 He laid her sister 
 She said O.K. 
 An that's all right 
 Buried her things today 
 Way back out deep 
 Behind the driveway 
 And that's all right 
 Sometimes these women are so easy 
 Sometimes these women are so cold 
 Sometimes these women seem to 
 Rip you right in two 
 Only if you let 'em get to you 
 Ya get out on your own 
 And you/take all that you own 
 And you/forget about your home 
 And then you're/just fuckin' gone 
 There's no logic here today 
 Do as you got to, go your own way 
 I said that's right 
 Time's short your life's your own 
 And in the end 
 We are just

 Tell ya, honey, how it feels 
 I've been dreamin' floatin' down stream 
 And losin' touch with all that's real 
 Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover 
 Never knowin' where you been-Ooh yeah 
 You've been fadin', always out paradin' 
 Keep in touch with mama kin! 
 You always got your tail on the wag 
 Spittin' fire from your mouth 
 Just like a dragon 
 You act like a perpetual drag 
 You better check it out 
 'Cause someday soon 
 You'll have to climb back on the wagon 
 It ain't easy livin' like you wanna 
 It's so hard to find piece of mind 
 Yes it is 
 The way I see it 
 You got to say 'shit' 
 But don't forget to drop me a line 
 Bald as an egg at eighteen 
 And workin' for daddy's such a drag 
 You still stuff your mouth 
 With his beans 
 You better check it out or someday soon 
 You'll have to climb back on the wagon 
 Keep in touch with mama kin 
 Tell her where you gone and been 
 Livin' out your fantasy

 Oh, ow, ow, ow, yeah! -owIt don't really matter 
 You're gonna find out for yourself 
 No, it don't really matter 
 You're gonna leave this thing to somebody else 
 If they were missionaries 
 Real time visionaries 
 Sittin' in a Chinese stew 
 To view my disinfatuation 
 I know that I'm a classic case 
 Watch my disenchanted face 
 Blame it on the Falun Gong 
 They've seen the end and you can't hold on now 
 'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you 
 To end the fascination 
 Even with an iron fist 
 More than you got to rule the nation 
 But all I got is precious time 
 It don't really matter 
 Guess I'll keep it to myself 
 Said it don't really matter 
 Each time I'll cry for somebody else 
 'Cause it would take a lot more time than you 
 Have got for masturbation 
 Even with your iron fist 
 More than you got to rule the nation 
 But all we got is precious time 
 More than you got to fool a nation 
 But all I got is precious time 
 It don't really matter 
 I'll guess you'll find out for yourself 
 No, it don't really matter 
 So you can hear it now from somebody else 
 You think you got it all locked up inside 
 And if you beat 'em enough they'll die 
 It's like a walk in the park to the cells 
 And now you're keeping your own kind in hell 
 And when your great wall rots, blame yourself 
 While they all reach out for your help 
 And you're out of timeThere's a time for a living 
 Time keeps on flying 
 Think you're loving baby 
 But all you're doing is crying 
 Can you feel? 
 Are those feelings real? 
 Look at your game, girl 
 Look at your game, girl 
 What a mad delusion 
 Living in that confusion 
 Frustration and doubt 
 Can you ever live without the game? 
 The sad, sad game 
 Mad game 
 Just to say loves' not enough 
 Even it can't be true 
 Oh, you can tell those lies, baby, but you're only fooling you 
 Can you feel? 
 Are those feelings real? 
 Look at your game, girl 
 Go on look at your game, girl 
 And if you can't feel 
 And those feelings ain't real 
 Then you better stop tryin' 
 Or your gonna play cryin' 
 Stop tryin' 
 Or your gonna play cryin' 
 Stop tryin' 
 That's the game 
 Sad sad game 
 Mad game 
 Sad game 
 spoken: 
 Thanks, Charles 
 JackAll the love in the world couldn't save you 
 All the innocence inside 
 You know I tried so hard to make you 
 Oh, to make you change your mind 
 And it hurts too much to see you 
 And how you left yourself behind 
 You know I wouldn't want to be you 
 Now there's a hell I can't describe 
 So now I wander through my days 
 And try to find my ways 
 To the feelings that I felt 
 I saved for you and no one else 
 And though as long as this road seems 
 I know it's called the street of dreams 
 But that's not stardust on my feet 
 It leaves a taste that's bittersweet 
 That's called the blues 
 I don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 Though it's what you planned, this much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore 
 I don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 You know it's what you planned, this much is true, oh oh 
 What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore, oh oh, ah 
 What this means to me 
 Is more than I know you believe 
 What I thought of you now 
 Has cost more that it should for me 
 What I thought was true before 
 Were lies I couldn't see 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Is only memories 
 Oh oh oh, what'd I tell you 
 Oh oh oh, that's what I tell you 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh inside of youTell everybody that I am sorry, truly sorry 
 For all the wrong I've done 
 I never meant to hurt nobody, no no 
 Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
 And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
 And as I lay me down to take my rest 
 I can see that it's just dust in the wind 
 Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter 
 You must believe that I love you still 
 But my strength, it grows weaker, and weaker 
 And my body has lost its will 
 'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
 And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
 And as I lay me down to take my rest 
 I can see that it's just dust in the wind 
 Oh Lord, I have lost once again 
 And there's no one to help me find my way home 
 Lord and I, Lord I never want to hurt nobody 
 And I, Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
 And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
 And as I lay me down to take my rest 
 I can see that it's just dust in the windListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve 
 Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are 
 Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock 
 What can I do? With a bitch like you 
 You know that it's true 
 All I have I ask of you 
 I'll be dammed 
 If it's not true 
 A bitch like you 
 Get your head down in the sky 
 Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart 
 Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are 
 Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart 
 What can I do? With a bitch like you 
 You know that it's true 
 All I have I ask of you 
 I'll be dammed 
 If it's not true 
 A bitch like youSick of this life 
 Not that you'd care 
 I'm not the only one with 
 Whom these feelings I share 
 Nobody understands, 
 Quite why we're here 
 We're searchin' for answers 
 That never appear 
 But maybe if I looked real hard I'd 
 I'd see your tryin' too 
 To understand this life, 
 That we're all goin' through 
 Then when she said she was gonna, like, wreck my car 
 I didn't know what to do 
 Woah 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
 And I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
 I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
 It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
 I'd be smilin' 
 I guess some things never change, ooh 
 Never change 
 I met an old cowboy 
 I saw the look in his eyes 
 Somethin' tells me he's been here before 
 'Cause experience makes you wise 
 I was only a small child 
 When the thought first came to me 
 That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son 
 That brought back the devil in me 
 Ooh, sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
 And I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
 I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
 It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
 I'd be smilin' 
 I guess some things never change 
 Never change 
 I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul 
 Still wet behind the ears 
 I been around this track a couple of times 
 But now the dust is startin' to clear, oh yeah 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
 I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
 I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
 It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
 I'd be smilin' 
 Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin' 
 No way I'd be smilin' 
 Ooh smilin' 
 Sick of this life 
 Not that you'd care 
 I'm not the only one with 
 Whom these feelings I shareTold you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but they'll never find 
 That it's all right, yes it's all right 
 Where to go, Where to see 
 It's always been that way and it can never be 
 But it's all right, yes its all right 
 Give it all and ask for no return 
 And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn 
 That it's all right, yes it's all right 
 Don't you know that it's so good for you 
 You can be making love and see it all go through 
 But it's all right, 'cause it all right 
 So I told you once about your friends and neighbors 
 They were always seeking but they'll never find it 
 It's all right, 'cause it's all rightListen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard 
 Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve 
 Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are 
 Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock 
 What can I do? With a bitch like you 
 You know that it's true 
 All I have I ask of you 
 I'll be dammed 
 If it's not true 
 A bitch like you 
 Get your head down in the sky 
 Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart 
 Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are 
 Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart 
 What can I do? With a bitch like you 
 You know that it's true 
 All I have I ask of you 
 I'll be dammed 
 If it's not true 
 A bitch like youMy child arrived just the other day 
 Came to the world in the usual way 
 But there were planes to catch and bills to pay 
 He learned to walk while I was away 
 He was talkin' 'fore I knew it 
 And as he grew he said, 
 I'm gonna be like you, Dad, 
 You know I'm gonna be like you. 
 And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, 
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon. 
 When you comin' home?' 
 'Son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then. 
 You know we'll have a good time then.' 
 My son turned ten just the other day. 
 He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play. 
 Can you teach me to throw?' 
 I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.' 
 He said, 'That's okay.' 
 And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said, 
 'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah. 
 You know I'm gonna be like him.' 
 Well, he came from college just the other day, 
 So much like a man, I just had to say, 
 'Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?' 
 He shook his head and he said with a smile, 
 'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys. 
 See you later. Can I have them please?' 
 I've long since retired, my son's moved away. 
 I called him up just the other day. 
 I said, 'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.' 
 He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. 
 You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu, 
 But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad. 
 It's been sure nice talkin' to you.' 
 And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me, 
 He'd grown up just like me. 
 My boy was just like me.All the love in the world couldn't save you 
 Or the innocence inside 
 You know I tried so hard to make you 
 To make you change your mind 
 And it hurts too much to see you 
 And how you left yourself behind 
 You know I wouldn't wanna be you 
 Now there's a hell I can't describe 
 So now I wander through my daze 
 Trying to find my ways 
 To the feelings that I felt 
 I saved for you and no one else 
 And though as long as this road seems 
 I know it's called the street of dreams 
 But that's not stardust on my feet 
 It leaves a taste that's bittersweet 
 That's called the blues 
 I don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 Although it's what we planned 
 This much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Don't live inside of you anymore 
 I don't know just what I should do 
 Everywhere I go I see you 
 Although it's what we planned 
 This much is true 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Don't live inside of you anymore 
 What this means to me 
 Is more than I know you believe 
 What I thought of you now 
 Has cost more than it should for me 
 What I thought was true before 
 Were lies I couldn't see 
 What I thought was beautiful 
 Was only memoriesWell, since my baby left me, 
 I found a new place to dwell. 
 It's down at the end of lonely street 
 At Heartbreak Hotel. 
 You make me so lonely baby, 
 I get so lonely, 
 I get so lonely I could die. 
 And although it's always crowded, 
 You still can find some room. 
 Where broken hearted lovers 
 Do cry away their gloom. 
 You make me so lonely baby, 
 I get so lonely, 
 I get so lonely I could die. 
 Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin', 
 And the desk clerk's dressed in black. 
 Well they been so long on lonely street 
 They ain't ever gonna look back. 
 You make me so lonely baby, 
 I get so lonely, 
 I get so lonely I could die. 
 Hey now, if your baby leaves you, 
 And you got a tale to tell. 
 Just take a walk down lonely street 
 To Heartbreak HotelIt's not how you're thinking 
 Or as you've imagined 
 You've been living in the shade of 
 Beliefs that were fashioned 
 To keep you in slavery and drain out your soul 
 But what can I do when there's so many liars 
 That crawl through your veins 
 Like millions of spiders 
 That seek out their victims 
 And ruin the wiser 
 Watch out 
 Gotcha 
 Oh my god 
 I can't deny this 
 I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
 Like nobody wanted to know 
 So give it away 
 Like they're not gonna fuck you 
 How long can you bear him 
 To come back and haunt you 
 To burn past your feelings 
 And cause you to suffer 
 You're starting to bleed 
 They don't give you up 
 Before it's too late 
 What will you offer 
 In way of a healing 
 I'm so confused, abused, misused 
 Oh my god 
 I can't deny this 
 I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
 Like nobody wouldn't know 
 Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
 This is better than a strong compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
 If only you had let me know 
 Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
 This is better than the last compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shadows 
 If only you had let me know 
 And they won't give in 
 'Cause they know what they're after 
 A kick in the face 
 Like it's all that would matter 
 Oh 
 Oh my god 
 I can't deny this 
 I've been taught just to murder and fight this 
 To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
 'Cause nobody wouldn't know 
 Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
 This is better than a good compromise 
 I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
 If only you had let me know 
 Ooh, well it's on with the show 
 Like the tide down on the ocean 
 The waves already set in motion 
 The only one in the game that's lost is you
